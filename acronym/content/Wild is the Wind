"\"Wild Is the Wind\" is a song written by Dimitri Tiomkin and Ned Washington for the 1957 film Wild Is the Wind. Johnny Mathis recorded the song for the film and released it as a single in November 1957. Mathis' version reached No. 22 on the Billboard chart. It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Song in 1958, but lost to \"All the Way\" by Jimmy Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn from The Joker is Wild.The song has been recorded many times, by many performers. The best known versions are one by Nina Simone in 1966, and one by David Bowie released in 1976/1981 as a tribute to Simone.\n\n\n== Johnny Mathis ==\nMathis recorded the song with a flexible sense of meter, rushing some words as if they were speech. At the 30th Academy Awards in 1958 (where it was nominated for Best Song), Mathis performed the song live.\n\n\n== Nina Simone ==\nNina Simone first recorded \"Wild Is the Wind\" live in 1959; this version appearing on the album Nina Simone at Town Hall. Her most famous interpretation of the song was a studio recording released on the compilation album Wild Is the Wind (1966), made of songs recorded for two earlier album projects. Simone reworked the song with slow, sparse instrumentation, stretching the vocal delivery to express soulful, hopeless loss. Simone's 1966 version appeared on the trailer for the 2008 movie Revolutionary Road. In November 2013 (54 years later after the first release of Simone's version), the song reached number 6 on Billboard's Digital Jazz chart.\n\n\n== David Bowie ==\nDavid Bowie recorded a version of \"Wild Is the Wind\" for his 1976 album Station to Station. Bowie was an admirer of Simone\u2019s style, and after meeting her in Los Angeles in 1975, he was inspired to record the song for his album. Bowie later said that Simone's version \"really affected me... I recorded it as an hommage to Nina.\" This was the only cover song released by Bowie during this period of his career; he wrote or co-wrote the other songs on his albums.Bowie took special care with the contemporary rock arrangement and production of \"Wild Is the Wind\", committing to an emotional and romantic vocal performance, the words drawn out more slowly and with a greater sense of loss, following the 1966 Simone version rather than the Mathis original.\n\n\n=== Promotional video ===\nTo promote the 1981 compilation album Changestwobowie, a black and white promotional video was made, directed by David Mallet. It featured Bowie and four musicians miming to the studio recording, including Tony Visconti (double bass), Coco Schwab (guitar), Mel Gaynor (drums), and Andy Hamilton (saxophone). The black backdrop and stark lighting reproduced the style of Bowie's Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour.\n\n\n=== 1976 production credits ===\nMusiciansDavid Bowie \u2013 vocals, acoustic guitar, production\nCarlos Alomar or Earl Slick \u2013 electric guitar\nGeorge Murray \u2013 bass guitar\nDennis Davis \u2013 drumsProducersHarry Maslin\nDavid Bowie\n\n\n=== Bowie live ===\nBowie performed the song during his June 2000 Mini Tour.
