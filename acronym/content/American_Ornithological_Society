"The American Ornithological Society (AOS) is an ornithological organization based in the United States. The society was formed in October 2016 by the merger of the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU) and the Cooper Ornithological Society. Its members are primarily professional ornithologists, although membership is open to anyone with an interest in birds.  The society publishes the two scholarly journals, The Auk and The Condor as well as the AOS Checklist of North American Birds.\nIn 2013, the American Ornithologists' Union announced a close partnership with the Cooper Ornithological Society, including joint meetings, a centralized publishing office, and a refocusing of their respective journals to increase efficiency of research. In October 2016, the AOU announced that it was ceasing to operate as an independent union and was merging with the Cooper Ornithological Society to create the American Ornithological Society.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe American Ornithologists' Union was founded in 1883. Three members of the Nuttall Ornithological Club, Elliott Coues, J. A. Allen, and William Brewster, sent letters to 48 prominent ornithologists inviting them \"to attend a Convention of American Ornithologists, to be held in New York City, beginning on September 26, 1883, for the purpose of founding an American Ornithologists' Union, upon a basis similar to that of the \"British Ornithologists' Union.\"  The addressees were selected mainly because of their \"scientific standing, but somewhat with regard to geographical representation, it being desirable to make the gathering as catholic and non-sectional as possible.\"  Twenty-five responded to the letter and 21 were present at the first meeting.\nThe founding convention was held in the library of the American Museum of Natural History on September 26, 1883. Founding members of the AOU include those present at the inaugural convention, listed below. In addition, the members of the new Union unanimously enrolled two others as founding members: Professor S. Baird, who was unable to attend due to his duties at the Smithsonian, and J. A. Allen, who could not attend due to physical disability.\nFrom Iowa: Charles Aldrich.\nFrom New York: Harry Balch Bailey, Eugene Pintard Bicknell, Daniel Giraud Elliot, Albert Kenrick Fisher, Joseph Bassett Holder, Edgar Alexander Mearns, and Clinton Hart Merriam.\nFrom Massachusetts: Charles Foster Batchelder, William Brewster, Charles Barney Cory, and Henry Augustus Purdie.\nFrom Oregon: Charles Bendire.\nFrom Maine: Nathan Clifford Brown.\nFrom New Brunswick: Montague Chamberlain.\nFrom the District of Columbia: Elliott Coues, D. Webster Prentiss, and Robert Ridgway.\nFrom Louisiana: Robert Wilson Shufeldt.\nFrom Canada: Thomas McIlwraith.\nFrom Ohio: John Maynard Wheaton.\n\n\n=== Presidents of the AOU ===\n\n\n== Membership ==\nRegular membership in the AOS is open to any dues paying person with an interest in birds. Student rates are available for full-time students. Student Membership Awards of a no-cost membership are available to qualified undergraduate and graduate students who wish to pursue a career in ornithology. There are three higher classes of membership, Elective Member, Honorary Fellow and Fellow.Elective Members are selected \"for significant contributions to ornithology and/or service to the Union.\" When elected, they must reside in the Western Hemisphere. A proposed Elective Member must be nominated by three Fellows or Elective Members and more than half of the Fellows and Elective Members must vote for the proposed member to be declared elected.Honorary Fellows are limited to 100 and are \"chosen for exceptional ornithological eminence and must at the time of their election be residents of a country other than the United States of America or Canada.\" Nominations for Honorary Fellow are by a special committee appointed by the president or any three Fellows.  A vote of the majority of the Fellows present at an annual meeting is required for election. Each Fellow may vote affirmatively for as many as there are vacancies.Fellows are chosen \"for exceptional and sustained contributions to ornithology and/or service to the Union\" and must be residents or citizens of the Western Hemisphere when elected. Candidates must be an Honorary Fellow or Elective Member in good standing. A vote of two thirds of the Fellows at an annual meeting is required for election as a Fellow.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nThe quarterly journal, The Auk, has been published since January 1884. The weekly journal The Condor, has been published since 1899. Other significant publications include the AOS Checklist of North American Birds, which is the standard reference work for the field, and a monograph series, Ornithological Monographs.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nThe AOS presents annual awards to recognize achievements and service, support research, and encourage student participation.\n\n\n=== Scientific Awards ===\nThe AOS recognizes members' outstanding contributions to ornithological science through four senior professional awards and three early professional awards:\n\nThe William Brewster Memorial Award \"is given annually to the author or co-authors (not previously so honored) of an exceptional body of work on birds of the Western Hemisphere\" and consists of a medal and honorarium. The first Brewster Medal was awarded in 1921.\nThe Elliott Coues Award has been presented annually since 1972 to recognize outstanding and innovative contributions to ornithological research without limitation as to geographic area, sub-discipline(s) of ornithology, or when the work was done. It consists of a medal and an honorarium.\nThe Loye and Alden Miller Research Award, awarded annually since 1993, recognizes lifetime achievement in ornithological research.\nThe Ralph W. Schreiber Conservation  Award honors extraordinary scientific contributions to the conservation, restoration, or preservation of birds and/or their habitats by an individual or team. The award has been presented since 2005 and consists of a certificate and honorarium.\nTwo James G. Cooper Young Professional Awards and one Ned K. Johnson Young Investigator Award are presented annually to recognize outstanding and promising work by researchers early in their careers in any field of ornithology. Each award includes an honorarium, an invitation to give a plenary at the annual meeting, gratis registration, and a travel stipend to the annual meeting up to $1000.\n\n\n=== Student Awards ===\nA decline in student membership in the AOU and other ornithological societies prompted creation of a Student Affairs Committee in 2003.  Several awards for students were created starting in 2005 as well as activities for students at annual meetings.\n\nThe Student Membership Award provides one year of full AOS membership benefits for qualified undergraduate or graduate students interested in pursuing a career in ornithology. Students must apply each year during the fall semester from September through December with a resume or curriculum vitae describing their degree program, the expected completion date, their academic or work experience, and interests in ornithology. A note of support from the student's academic advisor is also required. Membership in the AOS is required to compete for travel, research and presentation awards.\nThe AOS Student and Postdoctoral Travel Awards are competitive awards that defray travel expenses to annual meetings of the society for student members. Application procedures are distributed to eligible members each year.\nA student can compete for one of several AOS Student Presentation Awards when presenting a poster or oral paper at an annual meeting. The Robert B. Berry Student Award is given for the best oral presentation on a topic pertaining to avian conservation. The Mark E. Hauber Award is given for the best oral presentation on avian behavior. Four additional awards are given for the best presentation on any topic in ornithology. Applications are distributed to eligible AOS members.\n\n\n== Committees ==\nMuch of the AOS's work is accomplished by its thirty-three standing committees. Many of these are common for any organization such as Bylaws, History and Membership. Other committees are of special importance to ornithology.\nThe Committee on Bird Collections is charged with monitoring the status of avian material collections, maintaining liaison with organizations holding collections and conducting and publishing inventories of collections. Its work on permits for the possession and transport of specimens is especially important to museums and researchers.\nThe Committee on Classification and Nomenclature - South America, better known as the South American Classification Committee (SACC) deals with creating a standard classification, with English names, for the bird species of South America.\nThe North American Classification Committee (NACC) is responsible for the AOS Checklist of North and Middle American Birds.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of ornithology awards\nList of ornithology journals\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAmerican Ornithological Society website\nSouth American Classification Committee website"
