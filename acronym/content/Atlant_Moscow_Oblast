They were members of the Bobrov Division of the Kontinental Hockey League in the 2014\u201315 season, but have not been active since the 2015\u201316 season due to financial issues.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Overview ===\nAtlant was founded in 2005 when a team (Khimik) based in Voskresensk was relocated to Mytishchi. The old team traced its history back to 1953. Immediate success allowed Khimik to play in the Championship of the Soviet Union. Leading the team was playing-coach Nikolay Epshtein. In three years, Khimik was graduated to the top league of the Soviet Union. Three bronze medal results between 1965 and 1984 were capitulated in 1989 when the team achieved silver under prestigious head coach Vladimir Vasiliyev, a major accomplishment for a team from a small town. More impressive is how much successful homegrown talent has come out of the Khimik system, withs names including future Stanley Cup winners such as Igor Larionov and Valeri Kamensky.\nIn the spring of 1998, the status of the team changed, representing not only the city of Voskresensk but also the entire Moscow Oblast. This event took place on their 45th anniversary. During the 2005\u201306 season, the team relocated within the Moscow Oblast, from Voskresensk to Mytishchi. Following this, the team changed its name to Atlant, prior to its inclusion in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). Their new team logo features a Central Asian Shepherd Dog.\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\nAtlant signed NHL goaltender Ray Emery to a single year contract on July 9, 2008. The deal was reportedly worth in excess of $2 million, plus bonuses.Atlant and Emery had several issues, including Emery attacking the team trainer and his temporary refusal to return to the team after the KHL break over a contract dispute.
