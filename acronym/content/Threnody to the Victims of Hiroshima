"Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima, also translated as Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima (Polish: Tren Ofiarom Hiroszimy) is a musical composition for 52 string instruments composed  in 1960 by Krzysztof Penderecki. Dedicated to the residents of Hiroshima killed and injured by the first-ever wartime usage of an atomic weapon, the composition took third prize at the Grzegorz Fitelberg Composers' Competition in Katowice in 1960 and won the Tribune Internationale des Compositeurs UNESCO prize in 1961.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThe piece's written length is about 8 minutes and 37 seconds. Originally called 8'37\", the piece applies the sonoristic technique which tends to focus on specific characteristics and qualities of timbre, texture, articulation, dynamics, and motion in an attempt to create freer form, and rigors of specific counterpoint to an ensemble of strings treated to unconventional scoring. Penderecki's stated intent with the composition was to \"develop a new musical language\". Penderecki later said, \"It existed only in my imagination, in a somewhat abstract way.\" When he heard an actual performance, \"I was struck by the emotional charge of the work ... I searched for associations and, in the end, I decided to dedicate it to the Hiroshima victims\".The piece spans 52 string instruments, melding them together in sonoristic manipulation and counterpoint in a manner which, according to reviewer Paul Griffiths, makes the listener \"uneasy by choosing to refer to an event too terrible for string orchestral screams\". The vertical component of the score is varied, with 24 violins divided into four sections, 10 violas divided into two sections, 10 cellos divided into two groups, and 8 basses in two sections. Threnody's sustained tone clusters and various extended techniques \u2013 including a riot of varying vibrato, slapped instruments, playing on the tailpiece and behind the bridge \u2013 are matched by an optical notation full of thick black lines. At times Penderecki takes an aleatoric approach, offering the players a choice of techniques or demanding irregular degrees of vibrato. The piece is also marked by a considerable rigor in its timing indications, notated in seconds, as well as specific note clusters and the use of quarter tones, clustered pitches and sound mass which accumulates in a reservoir of hypertonality.\n\n\n== Usage in media ==\nIn film, excerpts from Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima are used in Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's 2006 film Children of Men, Wes Craven's 1991 film The People Under the Stairs, David Lynch's 2017 television series Twin Peaks, and in Gerry Anderson's 1969 film Journey to the Far Side of the Sun. In music, excerpts from Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima are sampled in one version of Manic Street Preachers's 1991 song You Love Us and in SebastiAn's 2010 release Bird Games.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBowed string instrument extended technique\n\n\n== References =="
