"Emmanuel G. Kriaras (Greek: \u0395\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03ae\u03bb \u0393. \u039a\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03c2; 28 November 1906 \u2013 22 August 2014) was a Greek lexicographer and philologist.  He was Emeritus Professor of the School of Philosophy at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. He was a student of Jean Psychari and the practice and ideology of demotic Greek.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nKriaras was born in Piraeus in Attica, Greece in 1906 to a family of Cretan origin and spent his early childhood on the island of Milos, the southwesternmost of the Cyclades. In 1914 his family moved to Chania, Crete, where he completed his secondary education. He studied at the University of Athens from 1924, where he graduated from the School of Philosophy in 1929.\n\n\n== Professional life ==\nKriaras worked in the medieval archives of the Academy of Athens, where he started in 1930. He was appointed principal in 1939. While working at the Academy he carried out post-graduate research, his work included periods in Munich (1930) and Paris (1945\u20131948). Some of his research was on Erot\u00f3kritos the early 17th century romantic epic which represents the high point of renaissance literature in Crete. This work was published in 1938 as Essays concerning the sources of Erot\u00f3kritos (\u039c\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c4\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af \u03c4\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b7\u03b3\u03ac\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0395\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5) for which he was awarded his doctorate by the University of Athens. In 1950 he was elected to the chair of Medieval Greek Philology at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. In addition to the main courses on his subject, he taught medieval Greek history and modern Greek philology until 1968 when his political views resulted in his dismissal by the right wing military junta.\nHis writings cover a wide field. Probably his most important work has been the Lexicon of Medieval Greek Demotic Literature 1100-1669 (\u039b\u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03ce\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 1100-1669), published since 1968 and now supplemented with a 2-volume condensed edition.
