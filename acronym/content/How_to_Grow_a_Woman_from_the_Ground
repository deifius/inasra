"How to Grow a Woman from the Ground is a 2006 album by Chris Thile and the Punch Brothers. It was released on Sugar Hill on September 12, 2006. The album is named after a song on the album; a cover of the original by folk singer Tom Brosseau.\nThe album debuted to positive reviews from major music critics, with critics calling the album \u201cfantastic, eclectic\u201d, and \u201cgenius\u201d. The album earned Thile a Grammy Award-nomination in 2006.\n\n\n== Conception and production ==\nFor one of his side projects, Chris Thile knew he wanted to form a string quintet composed of mandolin, violin, banjo, guitar, and bass with childhood friend and fiddler Gabe Witcher, but didn\u2019t know which direction he wanted to take the band. At the Telluride Bluegrass Festival in Telluride, Colorado, Thile met banjoist Noam Pikelny and later commented that \u201cevery note he played was something I wish I\u2019d played\u201d. It was then that Thile realized that he wanted to \u201cput [his] stamp on the traditional bluegrass ensemble\u201d. Thile wanted to get five musicians together for a Nashville jam session in 2005, after he found talented bluegrass musicians that could fill the positions. The bassist Thile was searching for, Greg Garrison, was recommended to Thile by Pikelny, who had performed alongside Garrison in the Cajun jam band Leftover Salmon. The guitar position was filled by Chris Eldridge, from the bluegrass band the Infamous Stringdusters. The five musicians met up in Nashville one day in 2005 and decided that they needed to \u201cdo something musical together\u201d. A few nights later, the group met again \u201cjust to drop a ton of money, drink too much wine, eat steaks, and commiserate about our failed relationships\u201d. That night, they came to an agreement and formed a bluegrass band.\nThe quintet decided to make this project serious and record an album. The album was recorded over the course of two days in 2006 at Sear Sound Recording Studios in New York. The album was not recorded digitally, but rather on tape. In an interview with the United States magazine Guitar Player, Chris Thile explained the old fashioned style in which the album was recorded: \n\nIt was recorded at Sear Sound in New York using two vintage Telefunken ELA M 251 E mics into a Forsell Technologies FetCode preamp. Most of it was recorded onto the same Studer 1\" two-track that was used to mix Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band! Everything was tracked live, and I\u2019ve decided never to record wearing headphones again unless I absolutely have to. Wearing headphones is bullshit, because you\u2019re in your own little world playing to a mix that no one will ever hear but you. What\u2019s the point?  \nHow to Grow a Woman from the Ground was self produced by Thile, and had no guest musicians, just the quintet. Other than the band, which in promotion of the album was named the How to Grow a Band, the album had a fairly small production crew; an engineer, an assistant engineer, two mastering people, and an artist.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\nHow to Grow a Woman from the Ground takes influence from different genres, \u201cdrawing equally from traditional bluegrass, progressive acoustic, and singer/songwriter traditions\u201d, with one critic calling the majority of the album very \u201croots oriented\u201d. The album has a bluegrass or progressive bluegrass core; bluegrass mandolinist Ronnie McCoury became the album\u2019s official \u201cbluegrass guru\u201d to ensure that there was \u201csomeone who could make sure we didn\u2019t do anything clich\u00e9d or trite\u201d. In regard to  the album\u2019s style, Thile said that \u201cAll in all, How to Grow a Woman from the Ground is a bluegrass record. There are definitely some musical things that are out of the ordinary, but it sounds like a bluegrass record to me. It\u2019s not all like \u201cBrakeman\u2019s Blues,\u201d but \u201cBrakeman\u2019s Blues\u201d doesn\u2019t sound out of place, and neither does \u201cThe Beekeeper\u201d sound out of place. It\u2019s all related.\u201d Much of Thile's work on the album was influenced by his divorce, and Thile claims that he could relate to the title of the album, a Tom Brosseau song. Thile said that he \"got my ass kicked by the last relationship I was in. This girl just left. It created a pretty serious complex for me.  I\u2019ve always been able to talk to girls, but I\u2019m scared of them. I just could relate to it. Like, man if I could just grow one, that would take care of a lot of problems.\"\n\n\n== Critical reception ==\nHow to Grow a Woman from the Ground received positive reviews from country and bluegrass music critics.  Allmusic called it \"fantastic\", and JamBase described it to be  \"a tasteful string dinner\" and stated that \"this is only the beginning of great things to come\". However, some critics found particular tracks too pale in comparison to the rest of the material. The Arizona Republic stated that the album was \"amazing\", except for \"Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground\" because \"Thile [couldn't] quite match Jack White's musical hysteria\". Music Box also said that tracks like \"Stay Away\" and \"I\u2019m Yours If You Want Me\" \"completely fell flat\". Regardless, the review still stated that \"the bulk of How to Grow a Woman from the Ground is remarkably engaging\". Bullz-Eye criticized Thile's vocal quality, saying that \"his voice often lacks the strength and/or character to carry the song\". On the contrary, the previously mentioned JamBase article complimented Thile's vocal strength, saying \"it's the soul in Thile's voice and the heart and intensity of the musicianship that give the album its power.\"\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nChris Thile \u2013 mandolin, lead vocals, producer\nNoam Pikelny \u2013 banjo, vocals\nGreg Garrison \u2013 bass, vocals\nChris Eldridge \u2013 acoustic guitar, vocals\nGabe Witcher \u2013 fiddle, vocals\nRonnie McCoury \u2013 \"bluegrass guru\"\nLoren Witcher \u2013 artwork\nGary Paczosa \u2013 mastering\nFred Forsell \u2013 mastering engineer\nMatthew Gephart \u2013 engineer\nEthan Donaldson \u2013 assistant engineer\n\n\n== Chart performance ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nHow to Grow a Woman from the Ground (liner notes).
