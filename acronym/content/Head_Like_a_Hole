"\"Head Like a Hole\" is a song by the American industrial rock band Nine Inch Nails, released as the second single from the group's debut album, Pretty Hate Machine.\nAlthough one of the more rock-oriented tracks on the album, many elements of electronic and dance music are still featured. The lyrical contents deal with themes of betrayal and angst, consistent with the rest of the album it's excerpted from.\n\"Head Like a Hole\" is among the band's most famous songs, and remains both a critical and fan favorite. It enjoyed heavy rotation on the radio at the time of its release, eventually reaching number 9 on Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. It has been covered by several artists, including Devo, Showbread, AFI, Korn and Buckcherry, and was also remade as \"On a Roll\" (performed by Miley Cyrus in character as \"Ashley O.\") for the Black Mirror episode \"Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too.\"\n\n\n== Recording ==\nTrent Reznor wrote \"Head Like a Hole\" in 1988, after touring with Skinny Puppy. Flood, Adrian Sherwood, and Keith LeBlanc were co-producers of the song, and it was recorded in 1989. \"Head Like a Hole\" was one of the last songs completed for the album, since Flood did not arrive to the studio until the completion of Depeche Mode's Violator (1990).\n\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n\"Head Like a Hole\" has been classified as an industrial rock and electronic rock song. Also recognized as an \"industrial dance anthem,\" it takes its influence from Ministry, as well as the thrash metal genre. The title is a reference to the phrase \"like a hole in the head\", referring to something that one doesn't need or desire. The tempo is 115 BPM, and it is played in the key of E Minor.The chords of this song are similar to the project's debut single, \"Down in It\". In contrast to \"Down in It\", \"Head Like a Hole\" has a longer intro, lasts roughly one minute longer (the song is five minutes long in its aggregate length), is heavy metal music-oriented, and has no rapping. \"Head Like a Hole\" is also the opening track on Nine Inch Nails' 1989 debut, and is one of the two Nine Inch Nails songs produced by Flood to appear on Pretty Hate Machine.\n\n\n== Release and reception ==\nLabeled as \"Halo 3\", Head Like a Hole is the third official Nine Inch Nails release, containing remixes of three different songs from Pretty Hate Machine. The single release is longer in duration than the album itself. The single peaked at #28 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart.A three-track version of this single was released in the UK containing \"Head Like a Hole (Opal)\" which is not included on the US release. This version begins with a sample of \"Tamborine\" by Prince, taken from his 1985 album Around the World in a Day and incorporates a drum loop sampled from \"Release It\" taken from another Prince record, the soundtrack to the Prince-directed movie Graffiti Bridge (1990). The saxophone in \"Release It\" can be heard before the drum loop begins. \"Head Like A Hole (Copper)\" samples the looping drum beat from \"Body Language\", a track off of the Hot Space (1982) album by Queen. The first track is mistakenly listed as \"Head Like a Hole (Slate)\" on the CD. \"Down in It (Shred)\" and \"Down in It (Singe)\" were previously released on the \"Down in It\" single; the latter track is extended by 18 seconds. The unlisted eleventh track is host Heather Day yelling \"Let's hear it for Nine Inch Nails! Woo! They're good!\" This is a sample from Dance Party USA during an appearance by the band on the show.\n\"Head Like a Hole\" was re-issued as a single in Australia in 1995, where it peaked at #57 on the ARIA singles chart and spent 7 weeks in the top 100.The 11-track United States version of \"Head Like a Hole\" has recently been repackaged and re-released. This version was also released in the United Kingdom, where it failed to reach the Top 40 Finally, in Germany, the single was released as \"You Get What You Deserve\". This release includes four tracks.\nIn a retrospective review of the song, Allmusic described \"Head Like a Hole\" as \"grand theater\", elaborating further by commenting the \"backing music was immaculately crafted and produced\". In its review of the single, the author was largely positive towards the song selection, even saying that the inclusion of \"Head Like a Hole\", \"Terrible Lie\", and \"Down in It\" \"renders Pretty Hate Machine mostly unnecessary\". As for the other tracks included on the single, Allmusic was less positive, adding, \"This is one case where quality definitely would have sufficed without the quantity\".The single was included in the 2015 Record Store Day\u2013Black Friday exclusive box set, Halo I\u2013IV.\n\n\n== Music video ==\nA music video was made for the \"Clay\" remix of this song. Directed by Eric Zimmerman, it was released in March 1990 and again later in 1997 on the Closure VHS. The video became popular on MTV and helped fuel NIN's early success. A slightly different edit of the video was also released for Flood's remix of the song, which is 17 seconds shorter than the \"Clay\" remix. The video features band members Trent Reznor, Richard Patrick, and Chris Vrenna, as well as guest drummer Martin Atkins performing in a cage.The video was filmed at the original location of Exit nightclub which was located at 1653 North Wells Street in Chicago.The video begins with black and white footage of a person hopping on one foot while spinning a staff which fades in and out against a background of blurred colors (excerpts of Maya Deren's unfinished documentary on voodoo rituals \"Divine Horsemen: The Living Gods of Haiti\"). Clips of Reznor putting his head in a bucket of water, and an off-screen person using the same bucket to make Reznor wet, were taken by a video camera before filming a performance of the song from Nine Inch Nails as a live band.The guitar Reznor uses in the video is a Jackson Dinky. It is first seen in first chorus, when Reznor, appearing to be dirty like the other band members (he had long hair and wore gritty clothing during production), bangs his head twice while singing the song. He does not use the guitar for the climax of the video, where wires tied to him slowly pull him up, leaving the frontman spinning upside down. At the same scene, Vrenna destroys his drum kit by throwing a bass drum of Atkins' drum kit towards the object. At a shot occurring prior to that point, broken Zildjian cymbals and a drum machine can be seen as parts of Vrenna's kit.\nThere are images that are shown for a few frames like \"HEAD\", \"16 SOUND START\", \"S M P T E UNIVERSAL LEADER\" and \"PICTURE\". Other images included a white dot set against a black background, a mirrored presentation showing the words \"REEL \u2116 PROD \u2116 PLAY DATE\" colored in yellow, one with the words \"PICTURE START\", and a frame consisting of \"C C F F\" placed near an outlined ring. The latter screen had an alternative version that was accompanied by a white number 3, also seen in the video. There are also visuals of four incomplete rotating mechanical models of human heads; one with film stills, another with a modified motherboard and other technology, the purple, wired, head with a blue screen showing an eye and various computer hardware, and the last containing blue skin, orange-pupil eyes, and a lightbulb. The former two were filmed in black and white, while the latter two in full color. All four are shown intercut with shots of people spinning baseball bats.\n\n\n== Live performances ==\n\nThe song has been the encore for most NIN shows (especially the Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series), or the last song before the encore if an encore took place. There are live videos of \"Head Like a Hole\" on the DVDs And All That Could Have Been and Beside You in Time.During Lollapalooza '91, Dave Navarro, Eric Avery, Gibby Haynes and Ice-T joined Nine Inch Nails live performances on-stage as additional guitarists for \"Head Like a Hole;\" except for the first show in Phoenix, AZ when NIN walked off stage after the first song in a snit.\nFor the Nights of Nothing mini-tour in 1996, Richard Patrick made a brief return to the band to perform guitar and vocals on \"Head Like a Hole\" at the Irving Plaza show in New York along with Clint Mansell, who joined NIN on this song at all three shows of the tour.\nIn the June 7, 2006 radio performance at Atlanta, Georgia, Trent Reznor and Peter Murphy played a reworked version of \"Head Like a Hole\".Lisa Kennedy Montgomery once sang the song loudly to Reznor to win a $20 bet. To express the evolving state of his values, Reznor said in 1997 that \"I don't want to be singing \"Head Like a Hole\" at age 50.\"\n\n\n== Legacy ==\nSince its commercial maxi-single release, \"Head Like a Hole\" continues to generate an impact on other musicians and bands. New Zealand-based grunge band HLAH is named after the song. The name is sometimes abbreviated to avoid copyright infringement issues.\n\"Head Like a Hole\" is the most widely covered Nine Inch Nails song. In 2005, The String Quartet Tribute released a cover album of reworked versions of Pretty Hate Machine, including \"Head Like a Hole\". Other bands who covered the track include punk rock band AFI, rock artist Ryan Star, new wave band Devo, indie rock band Honest Bob and the Factory-to-Dealer Incentives, gothic metal band Lullacry, nu metal band Korn, post-industrial band PIG, hard rock band Buckcherry, Christian rock band Showbread., and Miley Cyrus as Ashley O for the 2019 television series Black Mirror.\"Head Like a Hole\" was part of a controversy after the September 11 attacks, when Clear Channel Communications placed it in a 2001 list of post-9/11 inappropriate song titles not for radio airplay.The track was also featured as number 37 on PopMatters' \"The 100 Greatest Alternative Singles of the \u201880s\" list.American deathcore act Carnifex did a cover of the song on their EP Bury Me In Blasphemy.\n\"Head Like a Hole\", among other Nine Inch Nails songs, was remixed and rewritten by Charlie Brooker with Reznor's approval as the pop song \"On a Roll\" for the fifth series episode \"Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too\" of Black Mirror. The song was released as a single on June 14, 2019. At the end of the episode, Cyrus performed a cover version of \"Head Like A Hole\".\nThe song was used in the television advertising campaign for the action video game Gears of War 5.\nThe AFI versi\u00f3n originally was planned to appear in the v\u00eddeo game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas on the Radio X, but it was cut because the game events happens in 1992 and the AFI song was recorded in 2004.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n=== US version ===\n\n\n=== UK version ===\n\n\n=== Australian version ===\n\n\n=== \"You Get What You Deserve\" German promo ===\n\n\n== Releases ==\nTVT Records TVT 2614 \u2013 US 12\" Vinyl\nTVT Records TVT 2615-2 \u2013 US CD\nIsland Records 12 IS 484 878 893-1 \u2013 UK 12\" Vinyl\nIsland Records CID 482 878 893-2 \u2013 UK CD\nIsland Records 663 875 \u2013 German promo CD\n\n\n=== Rock Band 3 ===\nIt was made available to download on March 1, 2011 for use in the Rock Band 3 music gaming platform in both Basic rhythm, and PRO mode which utilizes real guitar / bass guitar, and MIDI compatible electronic drum kits / keyboards in addition to vocals.\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Head Like a Hole\" music video on YouTube\nhalo three at nin.com, the official website\nHead Like A Hole at the NinWiki\nhalo three at NIN Collector\nLyrics of this song at MetroLyrics"
