"Numerous Cyrillic alphabets are based on the Cyrillic script. The early Cyrillic alphabet was developed in the First Bulgarian Empire during the 9th century AD (in all probability in Ravna Monastery) at the Preslav Literary School by Saint Clement of Ohrid and Saint Naum and replaced the earlier Glagolitic script developed by the Byzantine theologians Cyril and Methodius (in all probability in Polychron). It is the basis of alphabets used in various languages, past and present, in parts of Southeastern Europe and Northern Eurasia, especially those of Slavic origin, and non-Slavic languages influenced by Russian. As of 2011, around 252 million people in Eurasia use it as the official alphabet for their national languages. About half of them are in Russia. Cyrillic is one of the most-used writing systems in the world.\nSome of these are illustrated below; for others, and for more detail, see the links. Sounds are transcribed in the IPA. While these languages by and large have phonemic orthographies, there are occasional exceptions\u2014for example, Russian \u27e8\u0433\u27e9 is pronounced /v/ in a number of words, an orthographic relic from when they were pronounced /\u0261/ (e.g. \u0435\u0433\u043e yego 'him/his', is pronounced [j\u026a\u02c8vo] rather than [j\u026a\u02c8\u0261o]).\nSpellings of names transliterated into the Roman alphabet may vary, especially \u0439 (y/j/i), but also \u0433 (gh/g/h) and \u0436 (zh/j).\nNon-Slavic alphabets are generally modelled after Russian, but often bear striking differences, particularly when adapted for Caucasian languages. The first few of these alphabets were developed by Orthodox missionaries for the Finnic and Turkic peoples of Idel-Ural (Mari, Udmurt, Mordva, Chuvash, and Kerashen Tatars) in the 1870s. Later, such alphabets were created for some of the Siberian and Caucasus peoples who had recently converted to Christianity. In the 1930s, some of those languages were switched to the Uniform Turkic Alphabet. All of the peoples of the former Soviet Union who had been using an Arabic or other Asian script (Mongolian script etc.) also adopted Cyrillic alphabets, and during the Great Purge in the late 1930s, all of the Latin alphabets of the peoples of the Soviet Union were switched to Cyrillic as well (the Baltic Republics were annexed later, and were not affected by this change). The Abkhazian and Ossetian languages were switched to Georgian script, but after the death of Joseph Stalin, both also adopted Cyrillic. The last language to adopt Cyrillic was the Gagauz language, which had used Greek script before.\nIn Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, the use of Cyrillic to write local languages has often been a politically controversial issue since the collapse of the Soviet Union, as it evokes the era of Soviet rule and Russification. Some of Russia's peoples such as the Tatars have also tried to drop Cyrillic, but the move was halted under Russian law. A number of languages have switched from Cyrillic to other orthographies\u2014either Roman\u2010based or returning to a former script.\nUnlike the Latin script, which is usually adapted to different languages by adding diacritical marks/supplementary glyphs (such as accents, umlauts, fadas, tildes and cedillas) to standard Roman letters, by assigning new phonetic values to existing letters (e.g. <c>, whose original value in Latin was /k/, represents /ts/ in West Slavic languages, /\u0295/ in Somali, /t\u0361\u0283/ in many African languages and /d\u0361\u0292/ in Turkish), or by the use of digraphs (such as <sh>, <ch>, <ng> and <ny>), the Cyrillic script is usually adapted by the creation of entirely new letter shapes. However, in some alphabets invented in the 19th century, such as Mari, Udmurt and Chuvash, umlauts and breves also were used.\nBulgarian and Bosnian Sephardim without Hebrew typefaces occasionally printed Judeo-Spanish in Cyrillic.\n\n\n== Common letters ==\nThe following table lists the Cyrillic letters which are used in the alphabets of most of the national languages which use a Cyrillic alphabet. Exceptions and additions for particular languages are noted below.\n\n\n== Slavic languages ==\nCyrillic alphabets used by Slavic languages can be divided into two categories:\n\nEast South Slavic languages and East Slavic languages, such as Bulgarian and Russian, share common features such as \u0419, \u044c, and \u044f.\nWest South Slavic languages, such as Serbian, share common features such as \u0408 and \u0459.\n\n\n=== East Slavic ===\n\n\n==== Russian ====\n\nYo (\u0401 \u0451) /jo/\nThe Hard Sign\u00b9 (\u042a \u044a) indicates no palatalization\u00b2\nYery (\u042b \u044b) indicates [\u0268] (an allophone of /i/)\nE (\u042d \u044d) /e/\n\u0416 and \u0428 indicate sounds that are retroflexNotes:\n\nIn the pre-reform Russian orthography, in Old East Slavic and in Old Church Slavonic the letter is called yer. Historically, the \"hard sign\" takes the place of a now-absent vowel, which is still preserved as a distinct vowel in Bulgarian (which represents it with \u044a) and Slovene (which is written in the Latin alphabet and writes it as e), but only in some places in the word.\nWhen an iotated vowel (vowel whose sound begins with [j]) follows a consonant, the consonant is palatalized. The Hard Sign indicates that this does not happen, and the [j] sound will appear only in front of the vowel. The Soft Sign indicates that the consonant should be palatalized in addition to a [j] preceding the vowel. The Soft Sign also indicates that a consonant before another consonant or at the end of a word is palatalized. Examples: \u0442\u0430 ([ta]); \u0442\u044f ([t\u02b2a]); \u0442\u044c\u044f ([t\u02b2ja]); \u0442\u044a\u044f ([tja]); \u0442 (/t/); \u0442\u044c ([t\u02b2]).Before 1918, there were four extra letters in use: \u0406\u0456 (replaced by \u0418\u0438), \u0472\u0473 (\u0424\u0438\u0442\u0430 \"Fita\", replaced by \u0424\u0444), \u0462\u0463 (\u042f\u0442\u044c \"Yat\", replaced by \u0415\u0435), and \u0474\u0475 (\u0438\u0436\u0438\u0446\u0430 \"Izhitsa\", replaced by \u0418\u0438); these were eliminated by reforms of Russian orthography.\n\n\n==== Belarusian ====\n\nThe Belarusian alphabet\n\nThe Belarusian alphabet displays the following features:\n\nGe (\u0413 \u0433) represents a voiced velar fricative /\u0263/.\nYo (\u0401 \u0451) /jo/\nI (\u0406 \u0456), also known as the dotted I or decimal I, resembles the Latin letter I. Unlike Russian and Ukrainian, \"\u0418\" is not used.\nShort I (\u0419 \u0439), however, uses the base \u0418 glyph.\nShort U (\u040e \u045e) is the letter \u0423 with a breve and represents /w/, or like the u part of the diphthong in loud. The use of the breve to indicate a semivowel is analogous to the Short I (\u0419).\nA combination of Sh and Ch (\u0428\u0427 \u0448\u0447) is used where those familiar only with Russian and or Ukrainian would expect Shcha (\u0429 \u0449).\nYery (\u042b \u044b) /\u0268/\nE (\u042d \u044d) /\u025b/\nAn apostrophe (\u2019) is used to indicate depalatalization of the preceding consonant. This orthographical symbol used instead of the traditional Cyrillic letter Yer (\u042a), also known as the hard sign.\nThe letter combinations Dzh (\u0414\u0436 \u0434\u0436) and Dz (\u0414\u0437 \u0434\u0437) appear after D (\u0414 \u0434) in the Belarusian alphabet in some publications. These digraphs represent consonant clusters \u0414\u0436 /d\u0292/ and \u0414\u0437 /dz/ correspondingly.\nBefore 1933, the letter \u0490 \u0491 was used.\n\n\n==== Ukrainian ====\n\nThe Ukrainian alphabet displays the following features:\n\nVe (\u0412) represents /\u028b/ (which may be pronounced [w] in a word final position and before consonants).\nHe (\u0413, \u0433) represents a voiced glottal fricative, (/\u0266/).\nGe (\u0490, \u0491) appears after He, represents /\u0261/. It looks like He with an \"upturn\" pointing up from the right side of the top bar. (This letter was not officially used in Soviet Ukraine in 1933\u20141990, so it may be missing from older Cyrillic fonts.)\nE (\u0415, \u0435) represents /\u025b/.\nYe (\u0404, \u0454) appears after E, represents /j\u025b/.\nE, \u0418 (\u0418, \u0438) represent /\u026a/ if unstressed.\nI (\u0406, \u0456) appears after Y, represents /i/.\nYi (\u0407, \u0457) appears after I, represents /ji/.\nYy (\u0419, \u0439) represents /j/.\nShta (\u0429, \u0449) represents /\u0283t\u0283/.\nAn apostrophe (\u2019) is used to mark nonpalatalization of the preceding consonant before Ya (\u042f, \u044f), Yu (\u042e, \u044e), Ye (\u0404, \u0454), Yi (\u0407, \u0457).\nLike in Belarusian Cyrillic, the sounds /d\u0292/, /dz/ are represented by digraphs \u0414\u0436 and \u0414\u0437 respectively.\nUntil reforms in 1990, soft sign (\u042c, \u044c) appeared at the end of the alphabet, after Yu (\u042e, \u044e) and Ya (\u042f, \u044f), rather than before them, as in Russian.\n\n\n==== Rusyn ====\n\nThe Rusyn language is spoken by the Lemko Rusyns in Carpathian Ruthenia, Slovakia, and Poland, and the Pannonian Rusyns in Croatia and Serbia.\n\n*Letters absent from Pannonian Rusyn alphabet.\n\n\n=== South Slavic ===\n\n\n==== Bulgarian ====\n\nThe Bulgarian alphabet features:\n\nThe Bulgarian names for the consonants are [b\u0264], [k\u0264], [\u026b\u0264] etc. instead of [b\u025b], [ka], [\u025bl] etc.\n\u0415 represents /\u025b/ and is called \"\u0435\" [\u025b].\nThe sounds /d\u0292/ (/d\u0361\u0292/) and /dz/ (/d\u0361z/) are represented by \u0434\u0436 and \u0434\u0437 respectively.\nYot (\u0419, \u0439) represents /j/.\n\u0429 represents /\u0283t/ (/\u0283\u0361t/) and is called \"\u0449\u044a\" [\u0283t\u0264] ([\u0283\u0361t\u0264]).\n\u042a represents the vowel /\u0264/, and is called  \"\u0435\u0440 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u044f\u043c\" [\u02c8\u025br \u0261o\u02c8ljam] ('big er'). In spelling however, \u042a is referred to as /\u0264/ where its official label \"\u0435\u0440 \u0433\u043e\u043b\u044f\u043c\" (used only to refer to \u042a in the alphabet) may cause some confusion. The vowel \u042a /\u0264/ is sometimes approximated to the /\u0259/ (schwa) sound found in many languages for easier comprehension of its Bulgarian pronunciation for foreigners, but it is actually a back vowel, not a central vowel.\n\u042c is used on rare occasions (only after a consonant [and] before the vowel \"\u043e\"), such as in the words '\u043a\u0430\u043d\u044c\u043e\u043d' (canyon), '\u0448\u043e\u0444\u044c\u043e\u0440' (driver), etc. It is called \"\u0435\u0440 \u043c\u0430\u043b\u044a\u043a\" ('small er').The Cyrillic alphabet was originally developed in the First Bulgarian Empire during the 9th \u2013 10th century AD at the Preslav Literary School.It has been used in Bulgaria (with modifications and exclusion of certain archaic letters via spelling reforms) continuously since then, superseding the previously used Glagolitic alphabet, which was also invented and used there before the Cyrillic script overtook its use as a written script for the Bulgarian language. The Cyrillic alphabet was used in the then much bigger territory of Bulgaria (including  most of today\u2019s Serbia), North Macedonia, Kosovo, Albania, Northern Greece (Macedonia region), Romania and Moldova, officially from 893. It was also transferred from Bulgaria and adopted by the East Slavic languages in Kievan Rus' and evolved into the Russian alphabet and the alphabets of many other Slavic (and later non-Slavic) languages. Later, some Slavs modified it and added/excluded letters from it to better suit the needs of their own language varieties.\n\n\n==== Serbian ====\n\nSouth Slavic Cyrillic alphabets (with the exception of Bulgarian) are generally derived from Serbian Cyrillic. It, and by extension its descendants, differs from the East Slavic ones in that the alphabet has generally been simplified: Letters such as \u042f, \u042e, and \u0401, representing /ja/, /ju/, and /jo/ in Russian, respectively, have been removed. Instead, these are represented by the digraphs \u27e8\u0458\u0430\u27e9, \u27e8\u0458u\u27e9, and \u27e8\u0458\u043e\u27e9, respectively. Additionally, the letter \u0415, representing /je/ in Russian, is instead pronounced /e/ or /\u025b/, with /je/ being represented by \u27e8\u0458e\u27e9. Alphabets based on the Serbian that add new letters often do so by adding an acute accent \u27e8\u00b4\u27e9 over an existing letter.\n\nThe Serbian alphabet shows the following features:\n\nE represents /\u025b/.\nBetween \u0414 and E is the letter Dje (\u0402, \u0452), which represents /d\u0291/, and looks like Tshe, except that the loop of the h curls farther and dips downwards.\nBetween \u0418 and \u041a is the letter Je (\u0408, \u0458), represents /j/, which looks like the Latin letter J.\nBetween \u041b and \u041c is the letter Lje (\u0409, \u0459), representing /\u028e/, which looks like a ligature of \u041b and the Soft Sign.\nBetween \u041d and \u041e is the letter Nje (\u040a, \u045a), representing /\u0272/, which looks like a ligature of \u041d and the Soft Sign.\nBetween \u0422 and \u0423 is the letter Tshe (\u040b, \u045b), representing /t\u0255/ and looks like a lowercase Latin letter h with a bar. On the uppercase letter, the bar appears at the top; on the lowercase letter, the bar crosses the top at half of the vertical line.\nBetween \u0427 and \u0428 is the letter Dzhe (\u040f, \u045f), representing /d\u0292/, which looks like Tse but with the descender moved from the right side of the bottom bar to the middle of the bottom bar.\n\u0428 is the last letter.\nCertain letters are handwritten differently, as seen in the adjacent image.\n\n\n==== Macedonian ====\n\nThe Macedonian  alphabet differs from Serbian in the following ways:\n\nBetween Ze (\u0417 \u0437) and I (\u0418 \u0438) is the letter Dze (\u0405 \u0455), which looks like the Latin letter S and represents /d\u0361z/.\nDje (\u0402 \u0452) is replaced by Gje (\u0403 \u0453), which represents /\u025f/ (voiced palatal stop). In some dialects, it represents /d\u0361\u0291/ instead, like Dje. It is written \u27e8\u01f4 \u01f5\u27e9 in the corresponding Macedonian Latin alphabet.\nTshe (\u040b \u045b) is replaced by Kje (\u040c \u045c), which represents /c/ (voiceless palatal stop). In some dialects, it represents /t\u0361\u0255/ instead, like Tshe. It is written \u27e8\u1e30 \u1e31\u27e9 in the corresponding Macedonian Latin alphabet.\nLje (\u0409 \u0459) often represents the consonant cluster /lj/ instead of /\u028e/.\nCertain letters are handwritten differently, as seen in the adjacent image.\n\n\n==== Montenegrin ====\n\nThe Montenegrin alphabet differs from Serbian in the following ways:\n\nBetween Ze (\u0417 \u0437) and I (\u0418 \u0438) is the letter \u0417\u0301, which represents /\u0291/ (voiced alveolo-palatal fricative). It is written \u27e8\u0179 \u017a\u27e9 in the corresponding Montenegrin Latin alphabet, previously written \u27e8Zj zj\u27e9 or \u27e8\u017dj \u017ej\u27e9.\nBetween Es (\u0421 \u0441) and Te (\u0422 \u0442) is the letter \u0421\u0301, which represents /\u0255/ (voiceless alveolo-palatal fricative). It is written \u27e8\u015a \u015b\u27e9 in the corresponding Montenegrin Latin alphabet, previously written \u27e8Sj sj\u27e9 or \u27e8\u0160j \u0161j\u27e9.\nThe letter Dze (\u0405 \u0455), from Macedonian, is used in scientific literature when representing the /d\u0361z/ phoneme, although it is not officially part of the alphabet. A Latin equivalent was proposed that looks identical to Ze (\u0417 \u0437).\n\n\n==== Bosnian ====\n\nThe Bosnian language uses Latin and Cyrillic alphabets. Latin is slightly more common. A Bosnian Cyrillic script (Bosan\u010dica) was used in the Middle Ages, along with other scripts Bosnian language.\n\n\n== Uralic languages ==\nUralic languages using the Cyrillic script (currently or in the past) include:\n\nFinnic: Karelian until 1921 and 1937\u20131940 (Ludic, Olonets Karelian); Veps; Votic\nKildin Sami in Russia (since the 1980s)\nKomi (Zyrian  (since the 17th century, modern alphabet since the 1930s); Permyak; Yodzyak)\nUdmurt\nKhanty\nMansi (writing has not received distribution since 1937)\nSamoyedic: Enets; Yurats; Nenets since 1937 (Forest Nenets; Tundra Nenets); Nganasan; Kamassian; Koibal; Mator; Selkup (since the 1950s; not used recently)\nMari, since the 19th century (Hill; Meadow)\nMordvin, since the 18th century (Erzya; Moksha)\nOther: Merya; Muromian; Meshcherian\n\n\n=== Karelian ===\n\nThe Karelian language was written in the Cyrillic script in various forms until 1940 when publication in Karelian ceased in favor of Finnish, except for Tver Karelian, written in a Latin alphabet. In 1989 publication began again in the other Karelian dialects and Latin alphabets were used, in some cases with the addition of Cyrillic letters such as \u044c.\n\n\n=== Kildin S\u00e1mi ===\n\nOver the last century, the alphabet used to write Kildin Sami has changed three times: from Cyrillic to Latin and back again to Cyrillic. Work on the latest version of the official orthography commenced in 1979. It was officially approved in 1982 and started to be widely used by 1987.\n\n\n=== Komi-Permyak ===\n\nThe Komi-Permyak alphabet:\n\n\n=== Mari alphabets ===\n\nMeadow Mari alphabet:\n\nHill Mari alphabet\n\n\n== Non-Slavic Indo-European languages ==\n\n\n=== Iranian languages ===\n\n\n==== Kurdish ====\n\nKurds in the former Soviet Union use a Cyrillic alphabet:\n\n\n==== Ossetian ====\n\nThe Ossetic language has officially used the Cyrillic script since 1937.\n\n\n==== Tajik ====\n\nThe Tajik language is written using a Cyrillic-based alphabet.\n\n\n==== Other ====\nShughni\nTat\nJudeo-Tat\nYaghnobi\nYazghulami language\n\n\n=== Romance languages ===\nRomanian (up to the 19th century; see Romanian Cyrillic alphabet).\nThe Moldovan language (an alternative name of the Romanian language in Bessarabia, Moldavian ASSR, Moldavian SSR and Moldova) used varieties of the Romanian Cyrillic alphabet in 1812\u20131918, and the Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet (derived from the Russian alphabet and standardised in the Soviet Union) in 1924\u20131932 and 1938\u20131989. Nowadays, this alphabet is still official in the unrecognized republic of Transnistria (see Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet).\nLadino in occasional Bulgarian Sephardic publications.\n\n\n=== Indo-Aryan ===\n\n\n==== Romani ====\nRomani is written in Cyrillic in Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria and the former USSR.\n\n\n== Mongolian ==\nThe Mongolic languages include Khalkha (in Mongolia), Buryat (around Lake Baikal) and Kalmyk (northwest of the Caspian Sea). Khalkha Mongolian is also written with the Mongol vertical alphabet. By 2025, Mongolia will phase out its use of Cyrillic and switch to its traditional Mongolian script.\n\n\n=== Overview ===\nThis table contains all the characters used.\n\u04ba\u04bb is shown twice as it appears at two different locations in Buryat and Kalmyk\n\n\n=== Khalkha ===\n\n\u0412 \u0432 = /w/\n\u0415 \u0435 = /j\u025b/, /j\u0153/\n\u0401 \u0451 = /jo/\n\u0416 \u0436 = /d\u0292/\n\u0417 \u0437 = /dz/\n\u041d \u043d = /n-/, /-\u014b/\n\u04e8 \u04e9 = /\u0153/\n\u04ae \u04af = /y/\n\u042b \u044b = /i\u02d0/ (after a hard consonant)\n\u042c \u044c = /\u012d/ (extra short)\n\u042e \u044e = /ju/, /jy/\nD d = /ji/The Cyrillic letters \u041a\u043a, \u041f\u043f, \u0424\u0444 and \u0429\u0449 are not used in native Mongolian words, but only for Russian loans.\n\n\n=== Buryat ===\nThe Buryat (\u0431\u0443\u0440\u044f\u0430\u0434) Cyrillic script is similar to the Khalkha above, but \u042c\u044c indicates palatalization as in Russian. Buryat does not use \u0412\u0432, \u041a\u043a, \u0424\u0444, \u0426\u0446, \u0427\u0447, \u0429\u0449 or \u042a\u044a in its native words.\n\n\u0415 \u0435 = /j\u025b/, /j\u0153/\n\u0401 \u0451 = /jo/\n\u0416 \u0436 = /d\u0292/\n\u041d \u043d = /n-/, /-\u014b/\n\u04e8 \u04e9 = /\u0153/\n\u04ae \u04af = /y/\n\u04ba \u04bb = /h/\n\u042b \u044b = /ei/, /i\u02d0/\n\u042e \u044e = /ju/, /jy/\n\n\n=== Kalmyk ===\nThe Kalmyk (\u0445\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0433) Cyrillic script is similar to the Khalkha, but the letters \u042d\u044d, \u042e\u044e and \u042f\u044f appear only word-initially.
