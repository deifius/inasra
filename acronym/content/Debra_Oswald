Debra Oswald's clear-eyed, compassionate play shows us the role of story in making sense, and thus its place in the persistence of hope.\"In 2020 Oswald will debut on stage, performing her one-woman show Is There Something Wrong With That Lady? at the Griffin Theatre.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nAACTA Awards, Best TV Screenplay, 2014: winner for Offspring, series 4, episode 13\nNew South Wales Premier's Literary Awards, Script Award, 2011: winner for Offspring\nNew South Wales Premier's Literary Awards, Play Award, 2008: winner for Stories in the Dark\nQueensland Premier's Literary Awards, Drama Script (Stage) Award, 2005: shortlisted for Mr Bailey's Minder\nGriffin Award for New Australian Playwriting, 2004: winner for Mr Bailey's Minder\nSeaborn Playwright's Prize for The Peach Season (2005)\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Plays ===\nDags (Currency Press, 1987)\nThe Two-way Mirror [manuscript]\nOur Hopeful Youth: a radio play with music in three scenes [manuscript]\nLumps (1993)\nGary's House (Currency Press in association with Playbox Theatre, 1996)\nSweet Road (Currency Press in association with Playbox Theatre, 2000)\nSkate (Currency Press, 2004)\nMr Bailey's Minder  (Currency Press, 2005)\nThe Peach Season  (Currency Press, 2007)\nStories in the Dark (Currency Press, 2008)\nHouse on Fire (2010)\n\n\n=== Novels ===\nUseful (Penguin Books, 2015) ISBN 9780143573739\nThe Whole Bright Year (Viking, 2018), ISBN 9780143788256\nThe Family Doctor (Allen & Unwin, 2021), ISBN 9781760877781\n\n\n=== Children's Books ===\n Me and Barry Terrific (Oxford University Press, 1987)\nThe return of the Baked Bean (Puffin, 1991)\nNathan and the ice rockets (Puffin Books, 1998) with Matthew Martin\nThe Redback Leftovers (Puffin, 2000)\nFrank and the emergency joke (Puffin, 2000) with Stephen Axelsen\nFrank and the secret club (Puffin Books, 2005) with Matthew Martin\nThe fifth quest (Puffin, 2002)\nGetting air (Random House Australia, 2007)\nBlue Noise (Random House Australia, 2009)\n\n\n=== Television Series ===\nBananas in Pyjamas (1992)\nSwinging (1997)\nOffspring (2010\u20132013)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArticle for the Sydney Morning Herald: http://www.smh.com.au/comment/why-patrick-had-to-die-and-why-ill-be-crying-too-20130813-2rufy.html\nInterview with Richard Fidler on ABC Radio: http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2011/06/06/3236566.htm\n\n\n== References ==\nLeser, David.
