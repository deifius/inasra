"The seventh generation (Generation VII) of the Pok\u00e9mon franchise features 88 fictional species of creatures introduced to the core video game series in the 2016 Nintendo 3DS games Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon and the 2017 3DS games Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, with two further species introduced in a 2018 update to the spin-off mobile game Pok\u00e9mon Go alongside the 2018 core series Nintendo Switch games Pok\u00e9mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, culminating to a total of 88. Some Pok\u00e9mon species in this generation were introduced in animated adaptations of the franchise before Sun and Moon.\nSince Pok\u00e9mon X and Y, all Pok\u00e9mon have been designed by a team of roughly 20 artists, led by Ken Sugimori and Hironobu Yoshida. Sun and Moon take place in the tropical Alola region, composed entirely of islands. Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! are set in the Kanto region, the same setting as generation I. Pok\u00e9mon Go is an augmented reality mobile game which uses the GPS and camera functions on the player's smartphone to display wild Pok\u00e9mon in the player's surrounding environment.The following list details the 88 Pok\u00e9mon of Generation VII in order of their National Pok\u00e9dex number. Pok\u00e9mon number 722 Rowlet to number 802 Marshadow were introduced in Sun and Moon in 2016 and number 803 Poipole to number 807 Zeraora were released in Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon in 2017. Two mythical Pok\u00e9mon, Meltan and Melmetal, debuted in Pok\u00e9mon Go in 2018; Meltan appears in the wild in Pok\u00e9mon Go when a Pok\u00e9mon is transferred to Let's Go, Pikachu! or Let's Go, Eevee!, while Melmetal is only obtainable by evolving Meltan in Pok\u00e9mon Go when the player collects candies. In addition to the new species of Pok\u00e9mon, two new formes of Zygarde appeared in Sun and Moon\u2014having previously appeared in the Pok\u00e9mon anime: the dog-like \"Zygarde 10% Forme\" and mech-like \"Zygarde Complete (100%) Forme\". Alternate forms that result in type changes and regional forms are included for convenience.\n\n\n== Design and development ==\nPok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon introduced \"Alola Forms\" of various generation I Pok\u00e9mon. These versions are to represent \"the different microclimates in the Alola region\". The Alolan versions of Pok\u00e9mon like Vulpix and Exeggutor have different appearances and types and were introduced alongside generation VII Pok\u00e9mon. Alex Hern of The Guardian suggested that the developers likely decided to redesign various generation I Pok\u00e9mon because, according to him, \"fan connection with the original 150 Pok\u00e9mon is as strong as it ever was, [while] the number of people who can tell a Pancham from a Swirlix is much smaller.\"\n\n\n== List of Pok\u00e9mon ==\n\n\n=== Alolan Forms ===\nVarious \"Alolan Forms\" of generation I Pok\u00e9mon were introduced in Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References =="
