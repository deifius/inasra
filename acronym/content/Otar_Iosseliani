He was born in the Georgian capital city of Tbilisi, where he studied at the Tbilisi State Conservatoire and graduated in 1952 with a diploma in composition, conducting and piano.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nIn 1953 he went to Moscow to study at the faculty of mathematics, but in two years he quit and entered the State Film Institute (VGIK) where his teachers were Alexander Dovzhenko and Mikhail Chiaureli. While still a student, he began working at the Gruziafilm studios in Tbilisi, first as an assistant director and then as an editor of documentaries.\nIn 1958 he directed his first short film Akvarel. In 1961 he graduated from VGIK with a diploma in film direction. When his medium-length film Aprili (1961) was denied theatrical distribution, Iosseliani abandoned filmmaking and in 1963\u20131965 worked first as a sailor on a fishing boat and then at the Rustavi metallurgical factory. Aprili was finally released only in 1972.\nIn 1966 he directed his first feature film Giorgobistve that was presented at the Critics' Week at the 1968 Cannes Film Festival and won a FIPRESCI award there. When his 1976 film Pastorali was shelved for a few years and then granted only a limited distribution, Iosseliani grew sceptical about getting any artistic freedom in his homeland. Following Pastorali's success at the 1982 Berlin Film Festival, the director moved to France where in 1984 he made Les Favoris de la Lune. The film was distinguished with a Special Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival. Since then Venice became a showcase for all his subsequent films.\nIn 1986 he was a member of the jury at the 36th Berlin International Film Festival.In 1989 he again received a Special Jury Prize for Et la Lumiere Fut and in 1992 the Pasinetti Award for Best Direction for La Chasse aux Papillons. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union he continued to work in France where he made the documentary Seule Georgie (1994) which was followed by the sardonic and allegorical Brigands - Chapitre VII (1996).\nIn 1995 he was a member of the jury at the 19th Moscow International Film Festival.In 2011 his film Chantrapas was selected as the Georgian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 84th Academy Awards, but it did not make the final shortlist.In 2011 Otar Iosseliani received a lifetime achievement honor \u2013 the CineMerit Award at the Munich International Film Festival. It was given by his former pupil, a Georgian filmmaker Dito Tsintsadze.\n\n\n== Political views ==\nIosseliani holds political views that are considered Russophobia by some observers. In particular, in the aftermath of the 2008 Russo-Georgian war he expressed his political views in an interview to Ukrainian Weekly 2000 news agency:\n\nWe (Georgians) will never be at peace with Russia again. Previously we felt contempt for it, but now what we feel is hatred -- and this is very serious. So, go live with your Russians the way you want to. [...] But there will be no way back! (for Georgians) Two hundred years of patience and contempt are over now!\n(Georgia has been a part of the Russian Empire from 1801 and later part of the USSR until 1991.)\nIn 2011, while appearing on Echo of Moscow, Ioseliani claimed that journalists intentionally distorted his words about Russians and attributed to him things he had never said.\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\nAkvarel (1958) (TV)\nSapovnela (1959)\nApril (1961) / Ap'rili\nTudzhi (1964)\nFalling Leaves (1966) / Giorgobistve\nGeorgian Ancient Songs (1969) / Dzveli qartuli simgera\nOnce Upon a Time There Was a Singing Blackbird (1970) Iqo shashvi mgalobeli\nPastorale (1975) / Past'orali\nLettre d'un cin\u00e9aste (1982) (TV)\nSept pi\u00e8ces pour cin\u00e9ma noir et blanc (1983)\nEuzkadi \u00e9t\u00e9 1982 (1983) (TV)\nFavorites of the Moon (1984) / Les Favoris de la lune\nUn petit monast\u00e8re en Toscane (1988)\nAnd Then There Was Light (1989) / Et la lumi\u00e8re fut\nChasing Butterflies, aka Hunting Butterflies, aka The Butterfly Hunt (1992) / La Chasse aux papillons\nSeule, Georgie (1994)\nBrigands-Chapter VII (1996) / Brigands, chapitre VII\nFarewell, Home Sweet Home (1999) / Adieu, plancher des vaches!\nMonday Morning (2002) / Lundi matin\nGardens in Autumn (2006) / Jardins en automne\nChantrapas (2010)\nWinter Song (2015) / Chant d'hiver \n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOtar Iosseliani at IMDb"
