"Aughinish (sometimes written as Aughnish) (Eachinis in Irish) is a small island and townland located in Oughtmama Parish of the Barony of Burren in north County Clare, in Ireland on the south shore of Galway Bay. By road it is 10.9 kilometres (6.8 mi) northwest of Kinvarra. The island is approximately two miles (3 km) wide and a mile (1.6 km) from the northernmost tip to the southernmost point and has approximately fifty inhabitants.\nThe island was originally connected to County Clare, but in 1755 that connection was lost due to the tsunami effect of the massive Portuguese earthquake. The British built the existing 0.5 miles (0.80 km) causeway to County Galway to service their troops in the Martello Tower constructed on the island after 1811. So to this day, land access to Aughinish, County Clare is still only through County Galway.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nResults of the 1901 Census for Aughinish\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nGlynn, Rose: The Story of Aughinish, 2002.
