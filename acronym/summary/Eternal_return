"Eternal return (also known as eternal recurrence) is a concept that the universe and all existence and energy has been recurring, and will continue to recur, in a self-similar form an infinite number of times across infinite time or space.\nThe concept is found in Indian philosophy and in ancient Egypt as well as Judaic wisdom literature (Ecclesiastes) and was subsequently taken up by the Pythagoreans and Stoics. With the decline of antiquity and the spread of Christianity, the concept largely fell into disuse in the Western world before it was revitalized by 19th century philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who connected the thought to many of his other concepts, including amor fati."
