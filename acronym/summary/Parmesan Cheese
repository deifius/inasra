"Parmigiano-Reggiano (, Italian: [parmi\u02c8d\u0292a\u02d0no red\u02c8d\u0292a\u02d0no]) is an Italian hard, granular cheese produced from cow's milk and aged at least 12 months.\n\nIt is named after the producing areas, the provinces of Reggio Emilia, Parma, the part of Bologna west of the Reno, and Modena (all in Emilia-Romagna); and the part of Mantua (Lombardy) on the right/south bank of the Po. Parmigiano is the Italian adjective for Parma and Reggiano that for Reggio Emilia.\nBoth \"Parmigiano-Reggiano\" and \"Parmesan\" are protected designations of origin (PDO) for cheeses produced in these provinces under Italian and European law.  Outside the EU, the name \"Parmesan\" can legally be used for similar cheeses, with only the full Italian name unambiguously referring to PDO Parmigiano-Reggiano.\nIt has been called the \"King of Cheeses\" and a \"practically perfect food\".\n\n"
