"Cupid and Psyche is a story originally from Metamorphoses (also called The Golden Ass), written in the 2nd century AD by Lucius Apuleius Madaurensis (or Platonicus). The tale concerns the overcoming of obstacles to the love between Psyche (; Greek: \u03a8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae, Greek pronunciation: [psy\u02d0.k\u02b0\u025b\u030c\u02d0], \"Soul\" or \"Breath of Life\") and Cupid (Latin Cupido, \"Desire\") or Amor (\"Love\", Greek Eros, \u1f1c\u03c1\u03c9\u03c2), and their ultimate union in a sacred marriage. Although the only extended narrative from antiquity is that of Apuleius from 2nd century AD, Eros and Psyche appear in Greek art as early as the 4th century BC. The story's Neoplatonic elements and allusions to mystery religions accommodate multiple interpretations, and it has been analyzed as an allegory and in light of folktale, M\u00e4rchen or fairy tale, and myth.The story of Cupid and Psyche was known to Boccaccio in c. 1370, but the editio princeps dates to 1469. Ever since, the reception of Cupid and Psyche in the classical tradition has been extensive. The story has been retold in poetry, drama, and opera, and depicted widely in painting, sculpture, and even wallpaper. Though Psyche is usually referred to in Roman mythology by her Greek name, her Roman name through direct translation is Anima."
