"Plectin is a giant protein found in nearly all mammalian cells which acts as a link between the three main components of the cytoskeleton: actin microfilaments, microtubules and intermediate filaments.  In addition plectin links the cytoskeleton to junctions found in the plasma membrane that structurally connect different cells. By holding these different networks together plectin plays an important role in maintaining the mechanical integrity and viscoelastic properties of tissues.\n\n"
