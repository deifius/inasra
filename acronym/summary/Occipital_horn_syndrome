"Occipital horn syndrome (OHS), formerly considered a variant of Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome, is an X-linked recessive mitochondrial and connective tissue disorder. It is caused by a deficiency in the transport of the essential mineral copper, associated with mutations in the ATP7A gene.Only about 2/3 of children with OHS are thought to have genetically inherited the disorder; the other 1/3 do not have the disease in their family history. Since the disorder is X-linked recessive the disease affects more males. This is because they do not have a second X chromosome, unlike females, so essentially are lacking the 'backup' copy with proper function. Females are much more likely to be carriers only. For a female to be affected they must carry two defective X chromosomes, not just one.The disorder is considered a milder variant of Menkes disease.\n\n"
