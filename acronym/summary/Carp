"In golf, par is the predetermined number of strokes that a proficient (scratch, or zero, handicap) golfer should require to complete a hole, a round (the sum of the pars of the played holes), or a tournament (the sum of the pars of each round).Holes are generally assigned par values between three and five. A typical 18-hole golf course will have a total par around 72, and a 9-hole par-3 course (where all holes are rated as par 3) will have a total par of 27."
