"In the traditions of Abrahamic religions, Noah ()\nfeatures as the tenth and last of the pre-Flood  patriarchs. His story appears in the Hebrew Bible (in the Book of Genesis, chapters 5\u20139) and in the Quran. The Genesis flood narrative is among the best-known stories of the Bible. Noah is also portrayed as a \"tiller of the soil\" and as a drinker of wine.\nAccording to the Genesis account, Noah labored faithfully to build the  Ark at God's command, ultimately saving not only his own family, but mankind itself and all land animals, from extinction during the  Flood. Afterwards, God made a covenant with Noah and promised never again to destroy all the earth's creatures with a flood. The flood narrative is followed by the story of the Curse of Ham.\nIn addition to his appearance in the Book of Genesis, Noah is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible in the First Book of Chronicles, and the books of  Tobit,  Wisdom, Sirach,  Isaiah,  Ezekiel, 2 Esdras, 4 Maccabees; the New Testament references him in the gospels of  Matthew and  Luke, and in the epistles (Epistle to the Hebrews, 1st Peter and 2nd Peter). Noah became the subject of much elaboration in the literature of later Abrahamic religions, including the Quran (Surahs  71,  7, 11, 54, and  21).\n\n"
