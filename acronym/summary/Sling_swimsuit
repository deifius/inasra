"The sling swimsuit is a one-piece swimsuit which is supported by fabric at the neck. Sling swimsuits provide as little coverage (or as much exposure) as, or even less than, a bikini. Monokini types also exist. The sling swimsuit is also known by a variety of names including \"suspender bikini\", \"sling bikini\", \"slingkini\", \"suspender thong\", \"slingshot swimsuit\" or just \"slingshot\". It is so named because of its resemblance to the Y-shape frame of a slingshot. It is sometimes listed as a bikini variant. When designed for or worn by a man, it is often called a \"mankini\".\n\n"
