It was founded by Russian immigrants in 1934 in Harbin, China. It was open to \"Russian boys and girls who believe in God, love Russia and respect labor\". \nThe Union's declared goal was \"saving Russian children from the streets and denationalization impact, raising them for future Russia in the Fascist spirit of religion and nationalism\". The Union's members were Russian emigrant children aged between 3 and 10. Their parent's letter affirming agreement was all that was needed to secure membership."
