"A neologism (; from Greek \u03bd\u03ad\u03bf- n\u00e9o-, \"new\" and \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 l\u00f3gos, \"speech, utterance\") is a relatively recent or isolated term, word, or phrase that may be in the process of entering common use, but that has not yet been fully accepted into mainstream language. Neologisms are often driven by changes in culture and technology. In the process of language formation, neologisms are more mature than protologisms. A word whose development stage is between that of the protologism (freshly coined) and neologism (new word) is a prelogism.Popular examples of neologisms can be found in science, fiction (notably science fiction), films and television, branding, literature, jargon, cant, linguistic and popular culture.\nExamples include laser (1960) from Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation; robotics (1941) from Czech writer Karel \u010capek's play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots); and agitprop (1930) (a portmanteau of \"agitation\" and \"propaganda\").\n\n"
