"The Cure  are an English rock band formed in Crawley, West Sussex, in 1976. The band has experienced several line-up changes, with vocalist, guitarist, and principal songwriter Robert Smith being the only constant member. The Cure first began releasing music in the late 1970s with their debut album Three Imaginary Boys (1979); this, along with several early singles, placed the band as part of the post-punk and new wave movements that had sprung up in the wake of the punk rock revolution in the United Kingdom. During the early 1980s, the band's increasingly dark and tormented music (as well as Smith's stage look) was a staple of the emerging style of music known as gothic rock.\nFollowing the release of the album Pornography in 1982, the band's future was uncertain. Smith was keen to move past the gloomy reputation his band had acquired, introducing a greater pop sensibility into the band's music. Songs such as \"Let's Go to Bed\" (1982), \"Just Like Heaven\" (1987), \"Lovesong\" (1989), and \"Friday I'm in Love\" (1992) aided the band in receiving commercial popularity. The band are estimated to have sold roughly 27 million records as of  2004 and have released thirteen studio albums, ten EPs, and over thirty singles to date."
