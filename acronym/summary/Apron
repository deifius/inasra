"An apron is a garment that is worn over other clothing and covers mainly the front of the body.\nThe word comes from old French napron meaning a small piece of cloth, however over time \"a napron\" became \"an apron\", a process in linguistics called rebracketing. It may have several different purposes and is today perhaps most known as a functional accessory that protects one's clothes and skin from stains and marks. However, various types of aprons may also be worn as a decoration, for hygienic reasons, as part of a uniform, or as protection from certain dangers such as acid, allergens or excessive heat. It can also be used in work stations to hold extra tools and pieces or protecting from dust and unwanted products.\nAs a top layer that covers the front body, the apron is also worn as a uniform, adornment, ceremonial garb (most notably the Masonic apron) or fashion statement. Apron styles can be practical, fashionable, and sentimental.\n\n"
