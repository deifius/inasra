"A retronym is a newer name for an existing thing that differentiates the original form/version from a more recent one. It is thus a word or phrase created to avoid confusion between two types, whereas previously (before there were more than one type), no clarification was required.Advances in technology are often responsible for the coinage of retronyms. For example, the term \"acoustic guitar\" was coined with the advent of electric guitars; analog watches were renamed to distinguish them from digital watches once the latter were invented; association football, rugby football, and gridiron football were coined to distinguish types of football; and \"push bike\" was created to distinguish from motorbikes and motorized bicycles."
