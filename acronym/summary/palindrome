"A  palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar. There are also numeric palindromes, including date/time stamps using short digits 11/11/11 11:11 and long digits 02/02/2020. Sentence-length palindromes ignore capitalization, punctuation, and word boundaries.\n\nComposing literature in palindromes is an example of constrained writing.\nThe word palindrome was introduced by Henry Peacham in 1638. It is derived from the Greek roots \u03c0\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd 'again' and \u03b4\u03c1\u00f3\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 'way, direction'; a different word is used in Greek, \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03b9\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 'carcinic' (lit. crab-like) to refer to letter-by-letter reversible writing."
