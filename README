Self
Recursive
Acronym

right now inasra is prepared build you an acronym tree 
that serves as a spine for a crossword you devise.  
You may then recursively acronymise.
we will build acronyms from 
news articles, dictionary entries, wikis.
inasra.me will be an web client in browser visualizing 

a crossword puzzle of paths
inasra will populate the crossword 
from the spine designed by the me
 

Motivation
This is a game which build crosswords.  There is potential for predictive free associations as well.

Build status
This is a work in progress, may never be complete.

Code style
Completely fluid as I am learning as I compose this software.  If you think I might benefit from a style I am not currently employing, let me know.  

Tech/framework used
Backend prototyped in python 3.xx
Frontend prototyped in puredata/GEM
Web interface?
Crosswords are ipuz compatible

####todo list####

inasra.me
-> ipuz handlers
-> morph wikichomping into DB + acronimisation
	-> db is mirrors of sources
		-> 
-> rt inasra process and gem UI
	-> camera control via click@letter. mouse and gesture
-> cc public domain content in a autoKenBurns media collage
-->  persistent autonymous vaporwave (this is what to be wary of)

inasra.us
-> global statistics
-> weird/normal == excentricity coefficient fader 
-> maximize dimensions of inasra
-> n dimensional decoheresy (like scrambled hackz)
-> get a swell readme organized. 

Simulate the User Experience
1) wikichomp_py3.py #run until you have a good spine
2) spinylze.py
3) sanitize acro_dicts
4) crystalyzation.pyb

 

Credits
u/jizzbug can take considerable credit for co-engineering the core concept

Tova@ps:1 showed me some principles re: classing it up, and web presence.  I am an egg!  Also the *zip trick.
