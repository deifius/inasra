Acronym

right now inasra is prepared build you an acronym tree 
that serves as a spine for a crossword you devise.  
You may then recursively acronymise.

we will build acronyms from 
news articles, dictionary entries, wikis.
inasra.me will be an web client in browser visualizing 
a crossword puzzle of paths
inasra will populate the crossword 
from the spine designed by the me

over iteration inasra will evolve a 
hyper-dimensional crosswords from aggregate 
user sessions (inasra.us)
inasra.us will then seek loops within the xword

####todo list####
inasra.me
-> morph wikichomping into DB + acronimisation
	-> db is mirrors of sources
		-> 
-> rt inasra process and gem UI
	-> camera control via click@letter. mouse and gesture
-> cc public domain content in a autoKenBurns media collage
-->  persistent autonymous vaporwave (this is what to be wary of)

inasra.us
-> global statistics
-> weird/normal == excentricity coefficient fader 
-> maximize dimensions of inasra
-> n dimensional decoheresy (like scrambled hackz)
-> get a swell readme organized.
