Acronym

right now, inasra is prepared to help you build an acronym tree 
that serves as a spine for a crossword you (me) devise.  
You may then recursively acronymise, 
and so begin an adventure of words and meaning.

we will build acronyms from 
news articles, dictionary entries, wikis; all avilable relephants.
there will be an inasra.me client that visualizes 
a crossword puzzle in the browser as relephant paths
inasra will populate a crossword puzzle 
from the spine designed by the the me

over iteration inasra will evolve a 
hyper-dimensional crosswords from aggregate 
user sessions (inasra.us)
inasra.us will then seek loops within the xwor[d] 

####todo list####
inasra.me
-> control camera via click at word/letter. mouse and gesture
-> active rt integration of inasra process and gem UX
-> cc public domain content in a autoKenBurns media collage
--> auto vaporwave (this is what to be afraid of)

inasra.us
-> global statistics
-> weird/normal == excentricity coefficient fader 
-> maximize dimensions of inasra
-> n dimensional decoheresy (like scrambled hackz)
-> get a swell readme organized.
