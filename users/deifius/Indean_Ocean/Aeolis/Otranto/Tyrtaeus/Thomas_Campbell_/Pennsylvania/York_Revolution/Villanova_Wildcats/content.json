"The Villanova Wildcats are the athletic teams of Villanova University. They compete in the Big East (NCAA Division I) for every sport; except football where they compete in the Colonial Athletic Association (Football Championship Subdivision, formerly Division I-AA, for football only). On December 15, 2012, Villanova and the other six, non-FBS schools announced that they were departing the Big East for a new conference. This conference assumed the Big East name on July 1, 2013.\n\n\n== Teams ==\n\n\n=== Men's basketball ===\n\nThe Villanova Wildcats compete in the Big East Conference and are coached by Jay Wright. The team has traditionally divided its home schedule between its on-campus arena, the William B. Finneran Pavilion, and the Wells Fargo Center in South Philadelphia, for larger draws. During the 2017\u201318 season, the team played its entire home schedule that season at the Wells Fargo Center following the reconstruction of the Pavilion scheduled to be completed in time for the 2018\u201319 school year. Wright has taken the Wildcats to 12 postseason appearances including 7 consecutive trips (2005\u20132011) and 5 consecutive trips (2013-2017) to the NCAA Tournament. The 2011-12 team struggled and missed postseason but Coach Wright brought a surprising young team back to the 2013 NCAA Tournament. Villanova has appeared in the NIT 17 times, winning in 1994, and won the Big East Tournament in 1995, 2015 and 2017. The Wildcats have appeared in the NCAA Men's Tournament 37 times, the 8th highest total in NCAA history have reached the Elite Eight 13 times. \nThey have been to the Final Four of the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament on five occasions. The 1939 team coached by Al Severance reached the inaugural NCAA Final Four played at the Palestra for the 1939 NCAA Basketball Tournament. All-American Howard Porter led a Wildcat team coached by Jack Kraft to Final Four of the 1971 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament. Coach Rollie Massimino took Villanova to a surprising 1985 National Championship. Current Coach Jay Wright reached the Final Four at the 2009 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament behind Dante Cunningham and Scottie Reynolds. The team most recently won the 2018 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament for their third National Championship.\nVillanova won the 1985 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament with a historic 66\u201364 win over top-seeded Georgetown. The eighth-seeded Wildcats (unranked in the final AP poll) beat Dayton (at Dayton), top-seeded Michigan, Maryland and second-seeded North Carolina to win the Southeast Regional en route to the Final Four in Lexington, Kentucky. After defeating 2-seed Memphis State (now known as Memphis) in the national semifinals, Villanova met defending champion and ten-point-favorite Georgetown, led by Patrick Ewing, in the title game on April 1, 1985. The Wildcat squad remains the lowest overall seed in tournament history to win the championship, and their overall team shooting percentage of 78.6% remains an NCAA tournament record for a single game. This Championship Game is often cited among the greatest upsets in college basketball history. Ed Pinckney, who shot 5-of-7 and had 16 points in the game, was named the NCAA Tournament's Most Outstanding Player.\nOn April 4, 2016, the Wildcats won their second NCAA Championship in Men's Basketball, the first time in 31 years. They beat the North Carolina Tar Heels 77-74 off a buzzer-beater shot by Kris Jenkins with 0.5 seconds remaining in regulation.  Two years later, on April 2, 2018, Villanova earned its third national championship beating the Michigan Wolverines 79\u201362.\n\n\n=== Women's basketball ===\n\nThe Villanova Wildcats women's basketball team are coached by Harry Perretta, now serving his 34th year as head coach of the team.

The Women's basketball program started in 1969 and played under CIAW and AIAW through 1981\u201382 season before moving to NCAA Division I. In the 81\u201382 season, the Wildcats posted an outstanding 29\u20134 record and reached the Final Four of the 1982 AIAW Women's Basketball Tournament before losing to eventual National Champion, Rutgers. \nThrough the 2009\u201310 season, the Villanova Women have a 669-413 alltime record since the program started in 1969.

This marked the ninth postseason appearance in the previous 10 years for the Wildcats. After playing in the 2000 WNIT, Villanova went to four consecutive NCAA Tournaments from 2001 to 2004 before playing in the WNIT in 2005, 2006 and 2008. \nThe 2002\u201303 season was a special one for the Wildcats. In addition to an impressive 28-6 overall record and a 12-4 Big East Conference mark, the Wildcats won their third Big East Conference Tournament championship and first since 1987 with an improbable 52\u201348 upset over previously unbeaten Connecticut. The win snapped Connecticut's then NCAA Division I women's basketball record of 70-straight victories and ended Connecticut's streak of nine-straight conference tournament championships.\nThe dean of the Big East and Big 5 coaches, Harry Perretta has brought the Wildcats national respect and success during his tenure at Villanova which began in 1978 at the age of 22. Coach Perretta reached a coaching milestone on November 12, 2011 with a win over Iona, representing the 600th win of his career. He is the 35th coach in the history of women's basketball at any level to reach the 600 win plateau, including the 22nd to accomplish the feat at the Division I level. Perretta is only the seventh NCAA Division I coaches to have 600 victories all at one school.
