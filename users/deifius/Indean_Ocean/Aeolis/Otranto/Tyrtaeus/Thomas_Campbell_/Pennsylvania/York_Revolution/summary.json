"The York Revolution is an American professional baseball team based in York, Pennsylvania. It is a member of the North Division of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, an independent \"partner league\" of Major League Baseball. The Revolution has played its home games at PeoplesBank Park, located in the Arch Street neighborhood, since 2007. The team has won the league championship three times, most recently over the Long Island Ducks on September 29, 2017.Before the Revolution's inaugural season, baseball fans in York had waited 38 years for the return of the sport since the York White Roses folded after the 1969 season. In 2006, Yorkers chose the name \"Revolution\" in a team-sponsored fan ballot. The name originally referred to the city's colonial heritage, especially because the Continental Congress passed the Articles of Confederation in York during the Revolutionary War. At the time of the American Revolution, York was one of the first capitals of the United States. In 2012, the Revolution unveiled a new brand to emphasize York's more recent contributions to the Industrial Revolution with a secondary emphasis on patriotism. The region is home to industrial manufacturers such as Harley-Davidson, Stauffer's, and York International/Johnson Controls. Many Yorkers also see the Revolution name as a symbol of the city's renaissance efforts.\n\n"
