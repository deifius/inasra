"Aeolis (; Ancient Greek: \u0391\u1f30\u03bf\u03bb\u03af\u03c2, Aiol\u00eds), or Aeolia (; \u0391\u1f30\u03bf\u03bb\u03af\u03b1, Aiol\u00eda), was an area that comprised the west and northwestern region of Asia Minor, mostly along the coast, and also several offshore islands (particularly Lesbos), where the Aeolian Greek city-states were located. Aeolis incorporated the southern parts of Mysia, and is bounded by it to the north, Ionia to the south, and Lydia to the east.\n\n"
