There have also been productions in Adelaide, Hobart, Newcastle, Canberra and Hjoerring, Denmark. Gary's House was on the New South Wales Year 12 drama syllabus. In 2000, her play Sweet Road was presented in Melbourne and Adelaide in a Playbox/STC of SA co production, and in Sydney by the Ensemble Theatre. Sweet Road, Gary's House and The Peach Season were all short-listed for the New South Wales Premier's Literary Awards.\nMr Bailey's Minder and The Peach Season both premiered at Griffin Theatre Company.

She's written two previous plays for the Australian Theatre for Young People \u2013 Skate, which toured to the Belfast Festival, and Stories in the Dark .\nOf Stories in the Dark, her winner in the NSW Literary Awards, the judges said: \"By engaging us with dark tales, paradoxically told as a distraction in a time of war, Oswald probes the role of imagination in survival, with insight and a sureness of craft.... Debra Oswald's clear-eyed, compassionate play shows us the role of story in making sense, and thus its place in the persistence of hope.\"In 2020 Oswald will debut on stage, performing her one-woman show Is There Something Wrong With That Lady? at the Griffin Theatre.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nAACTA Awards, Best TV Screenplay, 2014: winner for Offspring, series 4, episode 13\nNew South Wales Premier's Literary Awards, Script Award, 2011: winner for Offspring\nNew South Wales Premier's Literary Awards, Play Award, 2008: winner for Stories in the Dark\nQueensland Premier's Literary Awards, Drama Script (Stage) Award, 2005: shortlisted for Mr Bailey's Minder\nGriffin Award for New Australian Playwriting, 2004: winner for Mr Bailey's Minder\nSeaborn Playwright's Prize for The Peach Season (2005)\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Plays ===\nDags (Currency Press, 1987)\nThe Two-way Mirror [manuscript]\nOur Hopeful Youth: a radio play with music in three scenes [manuscript]\nLumps (1993)\nGary's House (Currency Press in association with Playbox Theatre, 1996)\nSweet Road (Currency Press in association with Playbox Theatre, 2000)\nSkate (Currency Press, 2004)\nMr Bailey's Minder  (Currency Press, 2005)\nThe Peach Season  (Currency Press, 2007)\nStories in the Dark (Currency Press, 2008)\nHouse on Fire (2010)\n\n\n=== Novels ===\nUseful (Penguin Books, 2015) ISBN 9780143573739\nThe Whole Bright Year (Viking, 2018), ISBN 9780143788256\nThe Family Doctor (Allen & Unwin, 2021), ISBN 9781760877781\n\n\n=== Children's Books ===\n Me and Barry Terrific (Oxford University Press, 1987)\nThe return of the Baked Bean (Puffin, 1991)\nNathan and the ice rockets (Puffin Books, 1998) with Matthew Martin\nThe Redback Leftovers (Puffin, 2000)\nFrank and the emergency joke (Puffin, 2000) with Stephen Axelsen\nFrank and the secret club (Puffin Books, 2005) with Matthew Martin\nThe fifth quest (Puffin, 2002)\nGetting air (Random House Australia, 2007)\nBlue Noise (Random House Australia, 2009)\n\n\n=== Television Series ===\nBananas in Pyjamas (1992)\nSwinging (1997)\nOffspring (2010\u20132013)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArticle for the Sydney Morning Herald: http://www.smh.com.au/comment/why-patrick-had-to-die-and-why-ill-be-crying-too-20130813-2rufy.html\nInterview with Richard Fidler on ABC Radio: http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2011/06/06/3236566.htm\n\n\n== References ==\nLeser, David.

The database includes other information sources in addition to member library collections. OCLC makes WorldCat itself available free to libraries, but the catalog is the foundation for other subscription OCLC services (such as resource sharing and collection management). WorldCat is used by librarians for cataloging and research and by the general public.\n\n\n== History ==\nOCLC was founded in 1967 under the leadership of Fred Kilgour. That same year, OCLC began to develop the union catalog technology that would later evolve into WorldCat; the first catalog records were added in 1971.In 2003, OCLC began the \"Open WorldCat\" pilot program, making abbreviated records from a subset of WorldCat available to partner web sites and booksellers, to increase the accessibility of its subscribing member libraries' collections.In October 2005, the OCLC technical staff began a wiki project, WikiD, allowing readers to add commentary and structured-field information associated with any WorldCat record. WikiD was later phased out, although WorldCat later incorporated user-generated content in other ways.In 2006, it became possible for anyone to search WorldCat directly at its open website, not only through the subscription FirstSearch interface where it had been available on the web to subscribing libraries for more than a decade before. Options for more sophisticated searches of WorldCat have remained available through the FirstSearch interface.In 2007, WorldCat Identities began providing pages for 20 million \"identities\", which are metadata about names\u2014predominantly authors and persons who are the subjects of published titles.In 2017, OCLC's WorldCat Search API was integrated into the cite tool of Wikipedia's VisualEditor, allowing Wikipedia editors to cite sources from WorldCat easily.Beginning in 2017, OCLC and the Internet Archive have collaborated to make the Internet Archive's records of digitized books available in WorldCat.As of July 2020, WorldCat contained almost 500 million bibliographic records in 483 languages, representing over 3 billion physical and digital library assets, and the WorldCat persons dataset (mined from WorldCat) included over 100 million people.Library contributions to WorldCat are made via the Connexion computer program, which was introduced in 2001; its predecessor, OCLC Passport, was phased out in May 2005.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCopac\nFaceted Application of Subject Terminology (FAST)\nList of academic databases and search engines\nOpen Library\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \n\"WorldCat\". oclc.org.
