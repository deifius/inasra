Clippers were generally narrow for their length, small by later 19th century standards, could carry limited bulk freight, and had a large total sail area. \"Clipper\" does not refer to a specific sailplan; clippers may be schooners, brigs, brigantines, etc., as well as full-rigged ships. Clippers were mostly constructed in British and American shipyards, though France, Brazil, the Netherlands and other nations also produced some. Clippers sailed all over the world, primarily on the trade routes between the United Kingdom and China, in transatlantic trade, and on the New York-to-San Francisco route around Cape Horn during the California Gold Rush. Dutch clippers were built beginning in the 1850s for the tea trade and passenger service to Java.The boom years of the clipper era began in 1843 in response to a growing demand for faster delivery of tea from China. This continued under the stimulating influence of the discovery of gold in California and Australia in 1848 and 1851, and ended with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869.\n\n\n== Origin and usage of \"clipper\" ==\nThe term \"clipper\" most likely derives from the verb \"clip\", which in former times meant, among other things, to run or fly swiftly. Dryden, the English poet, used the word \"clip\" to describe the swift flight of a falcon in the 17th century when he said \"And, with her eagerness the quarry missed, Straight flies at check, and clips it down the wind.\" The ships appeared to clip along the ocean water. The term \"clip\" became synonymous with \"speed\" and was also applied to fast horses and sailing ships. \"To clip it\", and \"going at a good clip\", are remaining  expressions.\n\nThe first application of the term \"clipper\", in a nautical sense, is uncertain. The Baltimore Clipper was in use over the last quarter of the 18th century through to the first half of the 19th century, but under a different name for much of that time. At first, these vessels were referred to as \"Virginia-built\" or \"pilot-boat model\"\u2014with the name \"Baltimore-built\" appearing during the War of 1812. It was not until the final days of the slave trade (c. 1835 -1850)\u2014just as the type was dying out\u2014that the name \"Baltimore Clipper\" became common. The retrospective application of the word \"clipper\" to this type has been a source of confusion.The Oxford English Dictionary's earliest quote (referring to the Baltimore Clipper) is from 1824. The Dictionary cites Royal Navy officer and novelist Frederick Marryat as using the term in 1830. British newspaper usage of the term can be found as early as 1832 and in shipping adverts from 1835. A US court case of 1834 has evidence which discusses a clipper being faster than a brig.\n\n\n== Definitions ==\nA clipper is a sailing vessel designed for speed, with that priority taking precedence over cargo carrying capacity, or building or operating costs. It is not restricted to any one rig, and while many were fully rigged ships, others were barques, brigs or schooners. Nor was the term restricted to any one hull type. Howard Chapelle lists three basic hull types for clippers. The first was characterised by the sharp deadrise and ends found in the Baltimore Clipper. The second was a hull with a full mid-section and modest deadrise, but sharp ends - this was a development of the hull-form of transatlantic packets. The third was more experimental, with deadrise and sharpness being balanced against the need to carry a profitable quantity of cargo. As well as a fast hull, a clipper carried a large sail area - by the standards of any other type of sailing ship, a clipper was greatly over-canvassed. The last defining feature of a clipper, in the view of maritime historian David MacGregor, was a captain who had the courage, skill and determination to get the fastest speed possible out of her.:16-21:321-322In assessing the hull of a clipper, different maritime historians use different criteria to measure \"sharpness\". \"Sharpness\" or \"fineness\" is explained by comparing a rectangular cuboid with the underwater shape of a vessel's hull. The more material you have to carve off the cuboid to achieve the hull shape, the sharper the hull. Ideally a maritime historian would be able to look at either the block coefficient of fineness or the prismatic coefficient of various clippers, but measured drawings or accurate half-models may not exist to calculate either of these figures. An alternative measure of sharpness for hulls of a broadly similar shape is the coefficient of under-deck-tonnage, as used by David MacGregor in comparing tea clippers. This could be calculated from the measurements taken to determine the registered tonnage, and so can be applied to more vessels.:87-88An \"extreme clipper\" has a hull of great sharpness, as judged either by the prismatic coefficient, the coefficient of under-deck-tonnage or some other technical assessment of hull shape. It is a term that has been misapplied in the past, without reference to hull shape. As commercial vessels, these are totally reliant on speed to generate a profit for their owners, as their sharpness limits their cargo carrying capacity.\nA \"medium clipper\" has a cargo-carrying hull that has some sharpness. In the right conditions and with a capable captain, some of these achieved notable quick passages. They were also able to pay their way when the high freight rates often paid to a fast sailer were not available (in a fluctuating market).\nThe term \"clipper\" applied to vessels between these two categories. They often made passages as fast as extreme clippers, but had less difficulty in making a living when freight rates were lower.:16\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe first ships to which the term \"clipper\" seems to have been applied were the Baltimore clippers, developed in Chesapeake Bay before the American Revolution, and reaching their zenith between 1795 and 1815.  They were small, rarely exceeding 200 tons OM. Their hulls were sharp ended and displayed a lot of deadrise. They were rigged as schooners, brigs or brigantines.\nIn the War of 1812 some were lightly armed, sailing under Letters of Marque and Reprisal, when the type\u2014exemplified by Chasseur, launched at Fells Point, Baltimore in 1814\u2014became known for her incredible speed; the deep draft enabled the Baltimore clipper to sail close to the wind. Clippers, running the British blockade of Baltimore, came to be recognized for speed rather than cargo space.\nThe type existed as early as 1780. A 1789 drawing of HMS Berbice (1780)\u2014purchased by the Royal Navy in 1780 in the West Indies\u2014represents the earliest draught of what became known as the Baltimore Clipper\nSpeed was also required for the Chinese opium trade between India and China. Small, sharp-bowed British vessels, called opium clippers, were the result.Meanwhile, Baltimore clippers continued to be built, in particular specifically for the opium trade between India and China, a trade that had become unprofitable for American shipowners by 1849.Ann McKim, built in Baltimore in 1833 by the Kennard & Williamson shipyard, is considered to be the original clipper ship. She measured 494 tons OM, and was built on the enlarged lines of a Baltimore clipper, with sharply raked stem, counter stern and square rig. Although Ann McKim was the first large clipper ship ever constructed, it cannot be said that she founded the clipper ship era, or even that she directly influenced shipbuilders, since no other ship was built like her; but she may have suggested the clipper design in vessels of ship rig. She did, however, influence the building of Rainbow in 1845, the first extreme clipper ship.In Aberdeen, Scotland, the shipbuilders Alexander Hall and Sons developed the \"Aberdeen\" clipper bow in the late 1830s: the first was Scottish Maid launched in 1839. Scottish Maid, 150 tons OM, was the first British clipper ship. \"Scottish Maid was intended for the Aberdeen-London trade, where speed was crucial to compete with steamships. The Hall brothers tested various hulls in a water tank and found the clipper design most effective. The design was influenced by tonnage regulations. Tonnage measured a ship's cargo capacity and was used to calculate tax and harbour dues. The new 1836 regulations measured depth and breadth with length measured at half midship depth. Extra length above this level was tax-free and became a feature of clippers. Scottish Maid proved swift and reliable and the design was widely copied.\" The earliest British clipper ships were built for trade within the British Isles (Scottish Maid was built for the Aberdeen to London trade). Then followed the vast clipper trade of tea, opium, spices and other goods from the Far East to Europe, and the ships became known as \"tea clippers\".\nFrom 1839, larger American clipper ships started to be built beginning with Akbar, 650 tons OM, in 1839, and including the 1844-built Houqua, 581 tons OM. These larger vessels were built predominantly for use in the China tea trade and known as \"tea clippers\". Smaller clipper vessels also continued to be built predominantly for the China opium trade and known as \"opium clippers\" such as the 1842-built Ariel, 100 tons OM.Then in 1845 Rainbow, 757 tons OM, the first extreme clipper was launched in New York. These American clippers were larger vessels designed to sacrifice cargo capacity for speed. They had a bow lengthened above the water, a drawing out and sharpening of the forward body, and the greatest breadth further aft. Extreme clippers were built in the period 1845 to 1855.\nIn 1851, shipbuilders in Medford, Massachusetts built the Antelope, often called the Antelope of Boston to distinguish her from other ships of the same name. This vessel is sometimes called one of the first medium clipper ships.  A ship-design journalist noted that \"the design of her model was to combine large stowage capacity with good sailing qualities.\" The Antelope was relatively flat-floored and had only an 8-inch dead rise at half-floor.\nThe medium clipper, though still very fast, could carry more cargo. After 1854 extreme clippers were replaced in American shipbuilding yards by medium clippers.The Flying Cloud was a clipper ship that claimed the fastest passage between New York and San Francisco, 89 days 8 hours. (The other contender for this \"blue ribbon\" title was the medium clipper Andrew Jackson\u2014there is an unresolvable argument over timing these voyages \"from pilot to pilot\").:60-61 Flying Cloud was the most famous of the clippers built by Donald McKay. She was known for her extremely close race with the Hornet in 1853; for having a woman navigator, Eleanor Creesy, wife of Josiah Perkins Creesy, who skippered the Flying Cloud on two record-setting voyages from New York to San Francisco; and for sailing in the Australia and timber trades.\nClipper ships largely ceased being built in American shipyards in 1859 when, unlike the earlier boom years, only four clipper ships were built; a few were built in the 1860s.  The last American clipper ship was \"the Pilgrim\" launched in 1873 from the shipyards of Medford, Massachusetts, built by Joshua T. Foster.  Among shipowners of the day, \"Medford-built\" came to mean the best.\n\nBritish clipper ships continued to be built after 1859. Earlier British clipper ships had become known as extreme clippers, and were considered to be \"as sharp as the American\"-built ships. From 1859 a new design was developed for British clipper ships that was nothing like the American clippers; these ships continued to be called extreme clippers. The new design had a sleek graceful appearance, less sheer, less freeboard, lower bulwarks, and smaller breadth. They were built for the China tea trade, starting with Falcon in 1859, and continuing until 1870. It is estimated that 25 to 30 of these ships were built, with no more than four or five in a year. The earlier ships were made from wood, though some were made from iron, just as some British clippers had been made from iron prior to 1859. In 1863 the first tea clippers of composite construction were brought out, combining the best of both worlds. Composite clippers had the strength of iron spars with wooden hulls, and copper sheathing could be added to prevent the fouling that occurred on iron hulls.After 1869, with the opening of the Suez Canal that greatly advantaged steam vessels (see Decline below), the tea trade collapsed for clippers. From the late 1860s until the early 1870s the clipper trade increasingly focused on the Britain to Australia and New Zealand route, carrying goods and immigrants, services that had begun earlier with the Australian Gold Rush of the 1850s. British-built clipper ships and many American-built British-owned ships were used. Even in the 1880s, sailing ships were still the main carriers of cargoes between Britain, and Australia and New Zealand. This trade eventually became unprofitable, and the ageing clipper fleet became unseaworthy.\n\n\n== China clippers and the apogee of sail ==\n\nAmong the most notable clippers were the China clippers, also called tea clippers or opium clippers, designed to ply the trade routes between Europe and the East Indies. The last example of these still in reasonable condition is Cutty Sark, preserved in dry dock at Greenwich, United Kingdom. Damaged by fire on 21 May 2007 while undergoing conservation, the ship was permanently elevated three metres above the dry dock floor in 2010 as part of a plan for long-term preservation.\nBefore the early 18th century, the East India Company paid for its tea mainly in silver. When the Chinese Emperor chose to embargo European manufactured commodities and demand payment for all Chinese goods in silver, the price rose, restricting trade. The East India Company began to produce something desired by the Chinese as much as tea was by the British: opium. This had a significant influence on both India and China. Opium was also imported into Britain and was not prohibited because it was thought to be medically beneficial. Laudanum, made from opium, was used as a pain killer, to induce sleep and to suppress anxiety. The famous literary opium addicts Thomas De Quincey, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Wilkie Collins also took it for its pleasurable effects. The Limehouse area in London was notorious for its opium dens, many of which catered for Chinese sailors as well as English addicts.Clippers were built for seasonal trades such as tea, where an early cargo was more valuable, or for passenger routes. One passenger ship survives, the City of Adelaide designed by William Pile of Sunderland. The fast ships were ideally suited to low-volume, high-profit goods, such as tea, opium, spices, people, and mail. The return could be spectacular. The Challenger returned from Shanghai with \"the most valuable cargo of tea and silk ever to be laden in one bottom\". Competition among the clippers was public and fierce, with their times recorded in the newspapers.\n\nThe last China clippers were acknowledged as the fastest sail vessels. When fully rigged and riding a tradewind, they had peak average speeds of over 16 knots (30 km/h). The Great Tea Race of 1866 showcased their speed.  China clippers are the fastest commercial sailing vessels ever made; their speeds have often been exceeded by modern yachts, but never by a commercial sail vessel. Only the fastest windjammers could attain similar speeds.\n\nThere are many ways of judging the speed of a ship: by knots, by day's runs, by port-to-port records.  Judged by any test, the American clippers were supreme.\nDonald McKay's Sovereign of the Seas  reported the highest speed ever achieved by a sailing ship \u2013 22 knots (41 km/h), made while running her easting down to Australia in 1854.  (John Griffiths' first clipper, the Rainbow, had a top speed of 14 knots...) There are eleven other instances of a ship's logging 18 knots (33 km/h) or over.  Ten of these were recorded by American clippers...\n Besides the breath-taking 465-nautical-mile (861 km) day's run of the Champion of the Seas, there are thirteen other cases of a ship's sailing over 400 nautical miles (740 km) in 24 hours...\nAnd with few exceptions all the port-to-port sailing records are held by the American clippers.\n\nThe 24h record of the Champion of the Seas wasn't broken until 1984 (by a multihull), or 2001 (by another monohull).\n\n\n== Decline ==\nThe American clippers sailing from the East Coast to the California goldfields were working in a booming market. Freight rates were high everywhere in the first years of the 1850s. This started to fade in late 1853. The ports of California and Australia reported that they were overstocked with goods that had been shipped earlier in the year. This gave an accelerating fall in freight rates that was halted, however, by the start of the Crimean War in March 1854, as many ships were now being chartered by the French and British governments. The end of the Crimean War in April 1856 released all this capacity back on the world shipping markets - the result being a severe slump. The next year saw the Panic of 1857, which had effects on both sides of the Atlantic. The USA was just starting to recover from this in 1861 when the American Civil War started, causing significant disruption to trade in both Union and Confederate states.:14-15As the economic situation deteriorated in 1853, American shipowners either did not order new vessels, or specified an ordinary clipper or a medium clipper instead of an extreme clipper. No extreme clipper was launched in an American shipyard after the end of 1854 and only a few medium clippers after 1860.\nBy contrast, British trade recovered well at the end of the 1850s. Tea clippers had continued to be launched during the depressed years, apparently little affected by the economic downturn.:15 The long-distance route to China was not realistically challenged by steamships in the early part of the 1860s. No true steamer (as opposed to an auxiliary steamship) had the fuel efficiency to carry sufficient cargo to make a profitable voyage. The auxiliary steamships struggled to make any profit.\n\nThe situation changed in 1866 when the Alfred Holt-designed and owned SS Agamemnon made her first voyage to China. Holt had persuaded the Board of Trade to allow higher steam pressures in British merchant vessels. Running at 60 psi instead of the previously permitted 25 psi, and using an efficient compound engine, Agamemnon had the fuel efficiency to steam at 10 knots to China and back, with coaling stops at Mauritius on the outward and return legs - crucially carrying sufficient cargo to make a profit.In 1869 the Suez Canal opened, giving steamships a route about 3,000 NM shorter than that taken by sailing ships round the Cape of Good Hope. Despite initial conservatism by tea merchants, by 1871 tea clippers found strong competition from steamers in the tea ports of China. A typical passage time back to London for a steamer was 58 days, while the very fastest clippers could occasionally make the trip in less than 100 days; the average was 123 days in the 1867\u201368 tea season. The freight rate for a steamer in 1871 was roughly double that paid to a sailing vessel. Some clipper owners were severely caught out by this: several extreme clippers had been launched in 1869, including Cutty Sark, Norman Court and the Caliph.\n\n\n== Surviving ships ==\n\nOf the many clipper ships built during the mid-19th century, only two are known to survive. The only intact survivor is Cutty Sark, which was preserved as a museum ship in 1954 at Greenwich for public display. The other known survivor is City of Adelaide; unlike Cutty Sark she was reduced to a hulk over the years. She eventually sank at her moorings in 1991, but was raised the following year and remained on dry land for years. Adelaide (a.k.a. S.V. Carrick) is the older of the two survivors, and was transported to Australia for conservation.\n\n\n== Clipper ship sailing cards ==\n\nDepartures of clipper ships, mostly from New York and Boston to San Francisco, were advertised by clipper ship sailing cards.  These cards, slightly larger than today's postcards, were produced by letterpress and wood engraving on coated card stock.  Most clipper cards were printed in the 1850s and 1860s, and represented the first pronounced use of color in American advertising art.\nRelatively few (perhaps 3,500) cards survive today.  With their rarity and importance as artifacts of nautical, Western, and printing history, clipper cards are highly prized by both private collectors and institutions.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of clipper ships\nClipper route\nSail-plan\nWindjammer\n\n\n=== People associated with clipper ships ===\nList of people who sailed on clipper ships\nJoseph Warren Holmes\nSamuel Hartt Pook\nWilliam Jardine\nDonald McKay\nJohn (or \"Jock\") \"White Hat\" Willis\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nCarl C.

Clippers were generally narrow for their length, small by later 19th century standards, could carry limited bulk freight, and had a large total sail area. \"Clipper\" does not refer to a specific sailplan; clippers may be schooners, brigs, brigantines, etc., as well as full-rigged ships. Clippers were mostly constructed in British and American shipyards, though France, Brazil, the Netherlands and other nations also produced some. Clippers sailed all over the world, primarily on the trade routes between the United Kingdom and China, in transatlantic trade, and on the New York-to-San Francisco route around Cape Horn during the California Gold Rush. Dutch clippers were built beginning in the 1850s for the tea trade and passenger service to Java.The boom years of the clipper era began in 1843 in response to a growing demand for faster delivery of tea from China. This continued under the stimulating influence of the discovery of gold in California and Australia in 1848 and 1851, and ended with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869."}, "Herald_of_the_Morning_": {"links": ["Sydney Deamer", "Australian NetGuide", "Nine Films and Television", "Peter Hartcher", "Love Island Australia", "Bondi Vet", "Brisbane Times", "Mark Ferguson ", "Kellie Sloane", "Anna Coren", "Amber Sherlock", "Deborah Knight", "Market libertarianism", "Samurai Sudoku", "Sportsday", "fourBH", "two thousand and four Australian federal election", "twoUE", "Continuous Call Team", "Melbourne", "The Garden Gurus", "John Fairfax", "Nine Entertainment", "VIAF ", "Alicia Loxley", "Jayne Azzopardi", "Jo Hall", "Mike Bailey ", "Nine Entertainment Co.", "Trove ", "Elizabeth Farrelly", "Paywall", "sixty Minutes ", "Ross Greenwood ", "Steven Jacobs ", "The Block ", "The Bulletin ", "Kate Collins ", "Nine Network", "TCN", "two thousand and thirteen Australian federal election", "ISSN ", "Paramedics ", "Sydney Morning Herald", "Shaun McManus", "Michael Thomson ", "NWS ", "Emmy Kubainski", "OCLC ", "one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four Australian federal election", "Jana Wendt", "Weekend Today ", "Charles Waterstreet", "Broadsheet", "NLA ", "Trove", "Lucian Boz", "The Times", "Digital content", "WorldCat Identities ", "nineNow", "Rumour File", "Ben Naparstek", "Mark McKenna ", "The Sydney Mail", "Michael Usher", "WAtoday", "Nine News", "Jaynie Seal", "Sharlyn Sarac", "GTV ", "ARIA Music Awards", "Mike Munro", "Grant Hackett", "Keith Martyn", "nineLife", "Your Money ", "Peter Overton", "Brian Henderson ", "Stan ", "South East Queensland", "MediaWeek", "nineHD", "Hugh Riminton", "Andrew Garran", "Weakest Link ", "Alan Ramsey", "Australian Ninja Warrior", "Ellen Fanning", "A Current Affair ", "Emergency ", "Federation of Australia", "Georgie Gardner", "Helen Kapalos", "Adele Horin", "John Langdon Bonython", "Ken Sutcliffe", "Jessica Braithwaite", "Mobile app", "Rake ", "Sydney", "Tracy Vo", "two thousand and ten Australian federal election", "Davina Smith", "Kate McClymont", "Nine's Wide World of Sports", "Stephanie Brantz", "List of newspapers in Australia", "William McGarvie", "Domain Group", "Cybershack", "Waleed Aly", "Tabloid ", "Alan Oakley", "Sarah Harris ", "Bill Shorten", "fourBC", "Julia Baird ", "Getaway ", "Wendy Kingston", "Nine Guide", "Frederick William Ward", "Kevin Crease", "Married at First Sight ", "Tim Gilbert ", "Encyclopedia Britannica", "Warren Tredrea", "ISBN ", "Alison Ariotti", "Social liberalism", "Magic one thousand, two hundred and seventy-eight", "Nine Radio", "nineGo!", "QTQ", "Michael Smyth ", "nineGem HD", "Peter Bowers ", "STW", "Benjamin Law ", "Kym Dillon", "Mike Carlton", "Website", "Logie Awards", "Tony Jones ", "Paul McGeough", "NTD ", "New South Wales", "sixPR", "two thousand and seven New South Wales state election", "Nine News Now", "Warwick Fairfax", "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

Founded in 1831 as the Sydney Herald, the Herald is the oldest continuously published newspaper in Australia and \"the most widely-read masthead in the country.\" The newspaper is published in compact print form from Monday to Saturday as The Sydney Morning Herald and on Sunday as its sister newspaper, The Sun-Herald and digitally as an online site and app, seven days a week. It is considered a newspaper of record for Australia. The print edition of the Sydney Morning Herald is available for purchase from many retail outlets throughout the Sydney metropolitan area, most parts of regional New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and South East Queensland.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe Sydney Morning Herald includes a variety of supplements, including the magazines Good Weekend (which is included in the Saturday edition of The Sydney Morning Herald); and Sunday Life. There are a variety of lift-outs, some of them co-branded with online classified advertising sites:\n\nThe Guide (television) on Monday\nGood Food (food) and Domain (real estate) on Tuesday\nMoney (personal finance) on Wednesday\nDrive (motor), Shortlist (entertainment) on Friday\nNews Review, Spectrum (arts and entertainment guide), Domain (real estate), Drive (motoring) and MyCareer (employment) on SaturdayThe executive editor is James Chessell and the editor is Lisa Davies. Tory Maguire is national editor, Monique Farmer is life editor, and the publisher is chief digital and publishing officer Chris Janz.\nFormer editors include Darren Goodsir, Judith Whelan, Sean Aylmer, Peter Fray, Meryl Constance, Amanda Wilson (the first female editor, appointed in 2011), William Curnow, Andrew Garran, Frederick William Ward, Charles Brunsdon Fletcher, Colin Bingham, Max Prisk, John Alexander, Paul McGeough, Alan Revell, and Alan Oakley.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nIn 1831 three employees of the now-defunct Sydney Gazette, Ward Stephens, Frederick Stokes, and William McGarvie, founded The Sydney Herald. In 1931 a Centenary Supplement (since digitised) was published. The original four-page weekly had a print run of 750. In 1840, the newspaper began to publish daily. In 1841, an Englishman named John Fairfax purchased the operation, renaming it The Sydney Morning Herald the following year. Fairfax, whose family were to control the newspaper for almost 150 years, based his editorial policies \"upon principles of candour, honesty and honour. We have no wish to mislead; no interest to gratify by unsparing abuse or indiscriminate approbation.\"\nDuring the 1890s Donald Murray, who invented a predecessor of the teleprinter, worked there. The Herald added a weekly \"Page for Women\" in 1905 which was edited by Theodosia Ada Wallace.The SMH was late to the trend of printing news rather than just advertising on the front page, doing so from 15 April 1944. Of the country's metropolitan dailies, only The West Australian was later in making the switch. In 1949, the newspaper launched a Sunday edition, The Sunday Herald. Four years later, this was merged with the newly acquired Sun newspaper to create The Sun-Herald, which continues to this day.\nBy the mid-1960s a new competitor had appeared in Rupert Murdoch's national daily The Australian, which was first published on 15 July 1964.\nIn 1995, the company launched the newspaper's web edition smh.com.au. The site has since grown to include interactive and multimedia features beyond the content in the print edition. Around the same time, the organisation moved from Jones Street to new offices at Darling Park and built a new printing press at Chullora, in the city's west. The SMH later moved with other Sydney Fairfax divisions to a building at Darling Island.\nIn May 2007, Fairfax Media announced it would be moving from a broadsheet format to the smaller compact or tabloid-size, in the footsteps of The Times, for both The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. Fairfax Media dumped these plans later in the year. However, in June 2012, Fairfax Media again announced it planned to shift both broadsheet newspapers to tabloid size, in March 2013. Fairfax also announced it would cut staff across the entire group by 1,900 over three years and erect paywalls around the papers' websites. The subscription type is to be a freemium model, limiting readers to a number of free stories per month, with a payment required for further access. The announcement was part of an overall \"digital first\" strategy of increasingly digital or on-line content over printed delivery, to \"increase sharing of editorial content,\" and to assist the management's wish for \"full integration of its online, print and mobile platforms.\"In July 2013 it was announced that the SMH 's news director, Darren Goodsir, would become editor-in-chief, replacing Sean Aylmer.On 22 February 2014, the final Saturday edition was produced in broadsheet format with this too converted to compact format on 1 March 2014, ahead of the decommissioning of the printing plant at Chullora in June 2014.Opinions vary over whether the paper is currently centrist or left wing. According to one commentator it is seen as the most centrist among the three major Australian non-tabloids (the other two being the Australian and the Age). In 2004, the newspaper's editorial page stated: \"market libertarianism and social liberalism\" were the two \"broad themes\" that guided the Herald's editorial stance. During the 1999 referendum on whether Australia should become a republic, the Herald (like the other two major papers) strongly supported a \"yes\" vote.The newspaper did not endorse the Labor Party for federal office in the first six decades of Federation, but did endorse the party in 1961, 1984, and 1987. During the 2004 Australian federal election, the Herald announced it would \"no longer endorse one party or another at election time\" but that this policy might yet be revised in the future: \"A truly awful government of any colour, for example, would bring reappraisal.\" In fact, astonishingly, on the eve of the 2016 federal election the paper's editor Darren Goodsir endorsed the broad policy platform of Labor leader Bill Shorten but the reelection of the Turnbull LNP government to deliver Labor's agenda. The Herald subsequently endorsed the centre-right Coalition at the 2007 New South Wales state election, but endorsed centre-left Labor at the 2007 and 2010 federal elections, before endorsing the Coalition at the 2013 federal elections. The Herald endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run-up for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.During the 2019 election, the Herald begrudgingly endorsed Bill Shorten and the centre-left Australian Labor Party after Malcolm Turnbull was ousted as PM. It is only the sixth time the Sydney Morning Herald has endorsed Labor since federation.\n\n\n== Notable contributors ==\n\n\n=== Writers ===\n\n\n=== Illustrators ===\nSimon Letch, named as one of the year's best illustrators on four consecutive occasions.\n\n\n== Ownership ==\n\nFairfax went public in 1957 and grew to acquire interests in magazines, radio, and television. The group collapsed spectacularly on 11 December 1990 when Warwick Fairfax, great-great-grandson of John Fairfax, attempted to privatize the group by borrowing $1.8 billion. The group was bought by Conrad Black before being re-listed in 1992. In 2006, Fairfax announced a merger with Rural Press, which brought in a Fairfax family member, John B. Fairfax, as a significant player in the company. From 10 December 2018 Nine and Fairfax Media merged into one business known as Nine. Nine Entertainment Co. owns The Sydney Morning Herald.\n\n\n== Content ==\n\n\n=== Column 8 ===\nColumn 8 is a short column to which Herald readers send their observations of interesting happenings. It was first published on 11 January 1947. The name comes from the fact that it originally occupied the final (8th) column of the broadsheet newspaper's front page. In a front-page redesign in the lead-up to the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000, Column 8 moved to the back page of the first section from 31 July 2000.The content tends to the quirky, typically involving strange urban occurrences, instances of confusing signs (often in Engrish), word play, and discussion of more or less esoteric topics.The column is also sometimes affectionately known as Granny's Column, after a fictional grandmother who supposedly edited it. The column's original logo was a caricature of Sydney Deamer, originator of the column and its author for 14 years.It was edited for 15 years by George Richards, who retired on 31 January 2004. Other editors besides Deamer and Richards have been Duncan Thompson, Bill Fitter, Col Allison, Jim Cunningham, Pat Sheil, and briefly, Peter Bowers and Lenore Nicklin. The column is, as of March 2017, edited by Herald journalist Tim Barlass, who frequently appends reader contributions with puns; and who made the decision to reduce the column's publication from its traditional six days a week, down to just weekdays.\n\n\n=== Opinion ===\nThe Opinion section is a regular of the daily newspaper, containing opinion on a wide range of issues. Mostly concerned with relevant political, legal and cultural issues, the section presents work by regular columnists, including Herald political editor Peter Hartcher, Ross Gittins and Elizabeth Farrelly, as well as occasional reader-submitted content. Iconoclastic Sydney barrister Charles C. Waterstreet, upon whose life the television workplace comedy Rake is loosely based, had a regular humour column in this section.\n\n\n=== Good Weekend ===\nGood Weekend is a liftout magazine that is distributed with both The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age in Saturday editions.\nIt contains, on average, four feature articles written by its stable of writers and others syndicated from overseas as well as sections on food, wine and fashion.\nWriters include Stephanie Wood, Jane Cadzow, Melissa Fyfe, Tim Elliott, Konrad Marshall and Amanda Hooton.\nOther sections include \"Modern Guru,\" which features humorous columnists including Danny Katz responding to the everyday dilemmas of readers; a regular column by writer Benjamin Law; a Samurai Sudoku; and \"The Two of Us,\" containing interviews with a pair of close friends, relatives or colleagues.\n\"Good Weekend\" is edited by Katrina Strickland. Previous editors include Ben Naparstek, Judith Whelan and Fenella Souter.\n\n\n== Digitisation ==\nThe paper has been partially digitised as part of the Australian Newspapers Digitisation Program project of the National Library of Australia.\n\n\n== See also ==\nJournalism in Australia\nList of newspapers in Australia\nThe Sydney Mail \u2013 weekly magazine of The Sydney Morning Herald, published from 1860 to 1938\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMerrill, John C. and Harold A.

She's written two previous plays for the Australian Theatre for Young People \u2013 Skate, which toured to the Belfast Festival, and Stories in the Dark .\nOf Stories in the Dark, her winner in the NSW Literary Awards, the judges said: \"By engaging us with dark tales, paradoxically told as a distraction in a time of war, Oswald probes the role of imagination in survival, with insight and a sureness of craft.... Debra Oswald's clear-eyed, compassionate play shows us the role of story in making sense, and thus its place in the persistence of hope.\"In 2020 Oswald will debut on stage, performing her one-woman show Is There Something Wrong With That Lady? at the Griffin Theatre.\n\n\n== Awards ==\nAACTA Awards, Best TV Screenplay, 2014: winner for Offspring, series 4, episode 13\nNew South Wales Premier's Literary Awards, Script Award, 2011: winner for Offspring\nNew South Wales Premier's Literary Awards, Play Award, 2008: winner for Stories in the Dark\nQueensland Premier's Literary Awards, Drama Script (Stage) Award, 2005: shortlisted for Mr Bailey's Minder\nGriffin Award for New Australian Playwriting, 2004: winner for Mr Bailey's Minder\nSeaborn Playwright's Prize for The Peach Season (2005)\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== Plays ===\nDags (Currency Press, 1987)\nThe Two-way Mirror [manuscript]\nOur Hopeful Youth: a radio play with music in three scenes [manuscript]\nLumps (1993)\nGary's House (Currency Press in association with Playbox Theatre, 1996)\nSweet Road (Currency Press in association with Playbox Theatre, 2000)\nSkate (Currency Press, 2004)\nMr Bailey's Minder  (Currency Press, 2005)\nThe Peach Season  (Currency Press, 2007)\nStories in the Dark (Currency Press, 2008)\nHouse on Fire (2010)\n\n\n=== Novels ===\nUseful (Penguin Books, 2015) ISBN 9780143573739\nThe Whole Bright Year (Viking, 2018), ISBN 9780143788256\nThe Family Doctor (Allen & Unwin, 2021), ISBN 9781760877781\n\n\n=== Children's Books ===\n Me and Barry Terrific (Oxford University Press, 1987)\nThe return of the Baked Bean (Puffin, 1991)\nNathan and the ice rockets (Puffin Books, 1998) with Matthew Martin\nThe Redback Leftovers (Puffin, 2000)\nFrank and the emergency joke (Puffin, 2000) with Stephen Axelsen\nFrank and the secret club (Puffin Books, 2005) with Matthew Martin\nThe fifth quest (Puffin, 2002)\nGetting air (Random House Australia, 2007)\nBlue Noise (Random House Australia, 2009)\n\n\n=== Television Series ===\nBananas in Pyjamas (1992)\nSwinging (1997)\nOffspring (2010\u20132013)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArticle for the Sydney Morning Herald: http://www.smh.com.au/comment/why-patrick-had-to-die-and-why-ill-be-crying-too-20130813-2rufy.html\nInterview with Richard Fidler on ABC Radio: http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2011/06/06/3236566.htm\n\n\n== References ==\nLeser, David.

The database includes other information sources in addition to member library collections. OCLC makes WorldCat itself available free to libraries, but the catalog is the foundation for other subscription OCLC services (such as resource sharing and collection management). WorldCat is used by librarians for cataloging and research and by the general public.\n\n\n== History ==\nOCLC was founded in 1967 under the leadership of Fred Kilgour. That same year, OCLC began to develop the union catalog technology that would later evolve into WorldCat; the first catalog records were added in 1971.In 2003, OCLC began the \"Open WorldCat\" pilot program, making abbreviated records from a subset of WorldCat available to partner web sites and booksellers, to increase the accessibility of its subscribing member libraries' collections.In October 2005, the OCLC technical staff began a wiki project, WikiD, allowing readers to add commentary and structured-field information associated with any WorldCat record. WikiD was later phased out, although WorldCat later incorporated user-generated content in other ways.In 2006, it became possible for anyone to search WorldCat directly at its open website, not only through the subscription FirstSearch interface where it had been available on the web to subscribing libraries for more than a decade before. Options for more sophisticated searches of WorldCat have remained available through the FirstSearch interface.In 2007, WorldCat Identities began providing pages for 20 million \"identities\", which are metadata about names\u2014predominantly authors and persons who are the subjects of published titles.In 2017, OCLC's WorldCat Search API was integrated into the cite tool of Wikipedia's VisualEditor, allowing Wikipedia editors to cite sources from WorldCat easily.Beginning in 2017, OCLC and the Internet Archive have collaborated to make the Internet Archive's records of digitized books available in WorldCat.As of July 2020, WorldCat contained almost 500 million bibliographic records in 483 languages, representing over 3 billion physical and digital library assets, and the WorldCat persons dataset (mined from WorldCat) included over 100 million people.Library contributions to WorldCat are made via the Connexion computer program, which was introduced in 2001; its predecessor, OCLC Passport, was phased out in May 2005.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCopac\nFaceted Application of Subject Terminology (FAST)\nList of academic databases and search engines\nOpen Library\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \n\"WorldCat\". oclc.org.
