"La boh\u00e8me (; Italian: [la bo\u02c8\u025bm]) is an opera in four acts, composed by Giacomo Puccini between 1893 and 1895 to an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa, based on Sc\u00e8nes de la vie de boh\u00e8me (1851) by Henri Murger. The story is set in Paris around 1830, and shows the Bohemian lifestyle (known in French as \"la boh\u00e8me\") of a poor seamstress and her artist friends.\nThe world premiere of La boh\u00e8me was in Turin on 1 February 1896 at the Teatro Regio, conducted by the 28-year-old Arturo Toscanini. Since then, La boh\u00e8me has become part of the standard Italian opera repertory and is one of the most frequently performed operas worldwide.In 1946, fifty years after the opera's premiere, Toscanini conducted a commemorative performance of it on radio with the NBC Symphony Orchestra. A recording of the performance was later released by RCA Victor on vinyl record, tape and compact disc. It is the only recording ever made of a Puccini opera by its original conductor (see Recording history below)."
