"Oncorhynchus is a genus of fish in the family Salmonidae; it contains the Pacific salmon and Pacific trout. The name of the genus is derived from the Greek  \u1f44\u03b3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 (\u00f3nkos, \u201clump, bend\u201d) + \u1fe5\u03cd\u03b3\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 (rh\u00fankhos, \u201csnout\u201d), in reference to the hooked jaws of males in the mating season (the \"kype\").\n\n"
