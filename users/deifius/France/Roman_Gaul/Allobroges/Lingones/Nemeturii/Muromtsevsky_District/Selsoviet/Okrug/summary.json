The word \"okrug\" is a loanword in English, but it is nevertheless often translated as \"area\", \"district\", or \"region\". \nEtymologically, \"okrug\" literally means \"circuit\". In meaning, the word is similar to the German term Bezirk (\"district\") and the French word Arrondissement; all of which refer to something \"encircled\" or \"surrounded\".\n\n"
