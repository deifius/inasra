"The Allobroges (Gaulish: *Allobrogis, 'foreigner, exiled'; Ancient Greek: \u1f08\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03b2\u03c1\u03af\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd, \u1f08\u03bb\u03bb\u03cc\u03b2\u03c1\u03b9\u03b3\u03b5\u03c2) were a Gallic people dwelling in a large territory between the Rh\u00f4ne river and the Alps mountains during the Iron Age and the Roman period.\nThe Allobroges came relatively late to Gaul compared to most other tribes of Gallia Narbonensis; they first appear in the historical record in connection with Hannibal's crossing of the Alps in 218 BC. Their territory was subsequently annexed to Rome in 121 BC by Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus and Quintus Fabius Maximus (Allobrogicus). An attempted revolt was crushed by Caius Pomptinus in 61 BC. However, they had rejected the second Catilinarian conspiracy in 63 BC. During the Gallic Wars, the Allobroges did not side with Vercingetorix at the Battle of Alesia in 52 BC."
