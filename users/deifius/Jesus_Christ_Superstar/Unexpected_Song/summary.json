The original lyrics were re-instated when the show was re-written for Brightman's run. It was later used in Lloyd Webber's and Black's reworking of the show, returning to the original album title of Tell Me on a Sunday. The single peaked at #76 on the UK Singles Chart.\nThe song's melody was originally heard as Variation 5 on Lloyd Webber's 1978 instrumental album Variations.  The remainder of the album became the dance music for the second act of Song & Dance."
