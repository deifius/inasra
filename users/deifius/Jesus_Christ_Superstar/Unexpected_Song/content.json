"\"Unexpected Song\" is a 1984 song from the musical Song and Dance originally sung (on Broadway) by Bernadette Peters. The music was written by Andrew Lloyd Webber, with lyrics by Don Black. A single was released by Sarah Brightman.  Originally released by Marti Webb and Justin Hayward as a duet in 1981 the song had new lyrics penned for the original 1982 production of the show and was re-titled \"When You Want to Fall in Love\". The original lyrics were re-instated when the show was re-written for Brightman's run. It was later used in Lloyd Webber's and Black's reworking of the show, returning to the original album title of Tell Me on a Sunday. The single peaked at #76 on the UK Singles Chart.\nThe song's melody was originally heard as Variation 5 on Lloyd Webber's 1978 instrumental album Variations.  The remainder of the album became the dance music for the second act of Song & Dance.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\"Unexpected Song\"\n\"Come Back With the Same Look in Your Eyes\"\n\n\n== Covers ==\nBernadette Peters on Song & Dance: Original Broadway Cast Recording (1985)\nMichael Crawford on Songs From the Stage & Screen (1987)\nPaul Jones on The Andrew Lloyd Webber Collection (1991)\nClare Burt on Aspects of Andrew Lloyd Webber Volume 2 (1996)\nMichael Ball on Julian Lloyd Webber's Unexpected Songs (2006)\nAnthony Warlow on Best of Act One\nDenise Van Outen on Tell Me On a Sunday (2006)\nMyrra Malmberg on Unexpected: Myrra Malmberg Sings Lloyd Webber (1997)\nDave Willetts on The Musicals Unplugged (2003)"
