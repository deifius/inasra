"Jesus Christ Superstar is a 1970 rock opera with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice. Initially unable to get backing for a stage production, the composers released it as a rock opera album musical. The success of the album led to the show's Broadway on-stage debut in 1971. The musical is sung-through, with no spoken dialogue. The story is loosely based on the Gospels' accounts of the last week of Jesus's life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his disciples  in Jerusalem and ending with the crucifixion. It depicts political and interpersonal struggles between Judas Iscariot and Jesus that are not present in the Bible.\nThe work interprets the psychology of Jesus and other characters. Much of the plot centres on Judas, who is dissatisfied with the direction in which Jesus is steering his disciples. Contemporary attitudes, sensibilities and slang pervade the rock opera's lyrics, and ironic allusions to modern life are scattered throughout the depiction of political events. Stage and film productions accordingly contain many intentional anachronisms.\nBy 1980, the musical had grossed more than $237 million worldwide.\n\n\n== Plot ==\n\n\n=== Act I ===\nJudas Iscariot, one of the Twelve Apostles, worries that the followers of Jesus are getting out of control and may be seen as a threat by the Roman Empire, who might harshly suppress them (\"Heaven on Their Minds\").\nThe other apostles anticipate going to Jerusalem with Jesus and ask him about his plans, but Jesus tells them not to worry about the future (\"What's the Buzz\"). Mary Magdalene tries to help Jesus relax. Judas tells Jesus that he should not associate with Mary, because a relationship with a sex-worker could be seen as inconsistent with his own teachings and be used against him (\"Strange Thing Mystifying\"). Jesus tells Judas that he should not judge others unless he is without sin. Jesus then reproaches the apostles and complains that none of them truly cares about him. Mary Magdalene tries to reassure Jesus while anointing him with oil (\"Everything's Alright\"). Judas angrily says that the money spent on oil should have been used to help the poor. Jesus answers that they do not have the resources to end poverty, and that they should be glad for what comforts they have.\nMeanwhile, Caiaphas, the High Priest of Israel, assembles the Pharisees and priests. Like Judas they fear that Jesus's followers will be seen as a threat by the Romans, and that many Jews might suffer the consequences. Caiaphas concludes that for the greater good, Jesus must be killed (\"This Jesus Must Die\"). As Jesus and his followers arrive exultantly in Jerusalem, they are confronted by Caiaphas, who demands that Jesus disperse the crowd. Jesus instead greets the happy crowd (\"Hosanna\"). Then Simon the Zealot suggests that Jesus lead his mob in a war against Rome and gain absolute power. Jesus rejects this, stating that none of his followers understand what true power is (\"Simon Zealotes/Poor Jerusalem\").\nPontius Pilate, the governor of Judea, has a dream in which he meets a Galilean and then receives the blame for the man's violent death at the hands of a mob (\"Pilate's Dream\"). Jesus arrives at the Temple and finds that it is being used as a marketplace; angered by this, he drives everyone out (\"The Temple\"). A group of lepers ask Jesus to heal them. Their number increases, and overwhelmed, Jesus rejects them. Mary Magdalene sings him to sleep (\"Everything's Alright (Reprise)\"). While he sleeps, Mary acknowledges that she is in love with him, and it frightens her (\"I Don't Know How to Love Him\").\nConflicted, Judas seeks out the Pharisees and proposes helping them arrest Jesus, believing that Jesus is out of control and that Jesus himself would approve of his action. In exchange for his help, Judas is offered thirty pieces of silver. Judas initially refuses, then accepts when Caiaphas suggests that he can use the money to help the poor (\"Damned for All Time/Blood Money\").\n\n\n=== Act II ===\nAt the Last Supper, Jesus is stung when the others get drunk and pay little attention to him. He remarks that \"for all you care\" the wine they are drinking could be his blood and the bread his body. He asks them to remember him, then frustrated by their lack of understanding, he predicts that Peter will deny him three times that night, and that another one of them will betray him. Judas admits that he is the one who will betray Jesus and, saying that he does not understand why Jesus did not plan things better, leaves (\"The Last Supper\").\nThe remaining apostles fall asleep, and Jesus retreats to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray (\"Gethsemane (I Only Want to Say)\"). He tells God his doubts about whether his mission has had any success, and angrily demands to know why he should continue and suffer the horrible death that awaits him. Receiving no answer, he realises that he cannot defy God's will, and surrenders to God.\nJudas arrives with Roman soldiers and identifies Jesus by kissing him on the cheek (\"The Arrest\"). When Jesus is brought to trial before the Sanhedrin, Caiaphas demands to know if he calls himself the Son of God, and Jesus responds merely \"That's what you say\". Caiaphas says that this is sufficient evidence and sends him to Pilate. Meanwhile, Peter is confronted by three people, to whom he denies that he knows Jesus (\"Peter's Denial\"). Mary observes that Jesus had predicted this.\nPilate asks Jesus if he is the King of the Jews. Jesus again answers \"That's what you say\". Since Jesus is from Galilee, Pilate says that he is not under his jurisdiction and sends him to King Herod (\"Pilate and Christ\"). The flamboyant King Herod asks Jesus to prove his divinity by performing miracles (\"King Herod's Song\"), but Jesus ignores him. Herod angrily sends him back to Pilate. Mary Magdalene, Peter, and the apostles remember when they first began following Jesus, and wish that they could return to a time of peace (\"Could We Start Again, Please?\").\nJudas is horrified at Jesus's harsh treatment. He expresses regret to the Pharisees, fearing that he will forever be remembered as a traitor. Caiaphas and Annas assure him that he has done the right thing. Judas throws down the money he was given and storms out. He curses God for manipulating him, and commits suicide (\"Judas's Death\").\nAt Jesus's trial, Pilate attempts to interrogate Jesus, but is cut off by a bloodthirsty mob which demands that Jesus be crucified. He tells the mob that Jesus has committed no crime and does not deserve to die, but to satisfy the mob he will have Jesus flogged (\"Trial Before Pilate\"). Pilate pleads with Jesus to defend himself, but Jesus says weakly that everything has been determined by God. The crowd still calls for Jesus's death and finally Pilate reluctantly agrees to crucify Jesus.\nAs Jesus awaits crucifixion, the spirit of Judas returns and questions why Jesus chose to arrive in the manner and time that he did, and if it was all part of a divine plan (\"Superstar\"). Jesus is crucified, recites his final words and dies (\"The Crucifixion\"). \n\n\n== Principal roles ==\n\n\n== Musical numbers ==\n\n\n== Production ==\n\nThe songs were first written and conceived as an album musical, before the musical was created and staged. On the original album, the part of Jesus was sung by Ian Gillan, with Murray Head as Judas, Michael d'Abo as King Herod, Yvonne Elliman as Mary Magdalene, and Barry Dennen as Pilate. In July 1971, the first authorised American concert of the rock opera took place in front of an audience of 13,000 people at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania's Civic Arena with Jeff Fenholt singing the role of Jesus, Carl Anderson as Judas and Elliman repeating as Mary Magdalene.In August 1971, MCA Records executive David Skepner reported that MCA had been investigating and shutting down 21 unauthorised productions in the US to protect the rights of London-based Leeds Music who owned the musical. The biggest violations Skepner found were a theatre troupe from Toronto that had crossed the US\u2013Canada border to perform with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, with only a few hours prior announcement, and another big production mounted by the Las Vegas Hilton. Other American cities with unauthorised productions included Washington D.C., Boston, Kansas City, Baltimore, San Francisco, Cincinnati, Richmond, Louisville, Cleveland, St. Louis, Memphis, Atlanta, Columbus, Troy, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, New Orleans, Brooklyn in New York City and Hollywood, Florida. Court injunctions were obtained in each of these cities to close the shows. Producer Robert Stigwood, who was assembling an authorised touring company, called these unsanctioned groups \"outright pirates\", stressing that he would continue to protect his rights by \"relentlessly\" pursuing legal action.\n\n\n=== Original Broadway production ===\nThe musical opened on Broadway on 12 October 1971, directed by Tom O'Horgan, at the Mark Hellinger Theatre. It starred Jeff Fenholt as Jesus, Ben Vereen as Judas and Bob Bingham as Caiaphas. Dennen and Elliman played the roles that they had sung on the album. Paul Ainsley was Herod. Anderson replaced Vereen when he fell ill, and the two performers later took turns playing the role. The show closed on 30 June 1973 after 711 performances. The production received mixed reviews; the bold casting of African-Americans as Judas was lauded, but reviewer Clive Barnes from The New York Times said, \"the real disappointment was not in the music ... but in the conception.\"  The show was nominated for five Tony Awards, including Best Score, but won none. Lloyd Webber won a Drama Desk Award as \"Most Promising Composer\", and Vereen won a Theatre World Award.\n\n\n=== Controversy ===\nThe Broadway show and subsequent productions were condemned by some religious groups. Tim Rice was quoted as saying \"It happens that we don't see Christ as God but simply the right man at the right time at the right place.\" Some Christians considered such comments to be blasphemous, the character of Judas too sympathetic and some of his criticisms of Jesus offensive. The musical's lack of allusion to the resurrection of Jesus has resulted in criticism similar to that of fellow musical Godspell, which also did not clearly depict the resurrection.\nAt the same time, some Jews claimed that it bolstered the antisemitic belief that the Jews were responsible for Jesus's death by showing most of the villains as Jewish (Caiaphas and the other priests, Herod) and showing the crowd in Jerusalem calling for the crucifixion. The musical was banned in South Africa for being \"irreligious\". A 1972 production of the play was banned in the Hungarian People's Republic for \"distribution of religious propaganda\".\n\n\n=== Other 1970s and 1980s productions ===\n\nSuperstar opened at the Palace Theatre in London in 1972, starring Paul Nicholas as Jesus, Stephen Tate as Judas and Dana Gillespie as Mary Magdalene. It was directed by Australian Jim Sharman. This production was much more successful than the original production on Broadway, running for eight years and becoming the United Kingdom's longest-running musical at the time. Dmitri Shostakovich attended this production in London just before his death. He regretted that he could not have composed something like it; he lauded especially a rock band underpinning full symphonic strings, brass and woodwind.One of the earliest foreign productions was a five-day run in Sweden at Scandinavium in Gothenburg, opening on 18 February 1972 and playing to 74,000 people (a record at the time). Starring as Mary Magdalene was Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog. On 16 March 1972 an oratorio version was performed at Memorial Drive Park in Adelaide, South Australia as part of the Adelaide Festival of the Arts. This was followed in May by the first full Australian production, at the Capitol Theatre, Sydney, later moving to the Palais Theatre in Melbourne. Sharman again directed, and the cast included Trevor White as Jesus, Jon English as Judas, and Michele Fawdon (1972\u20131973) and Marcia Hines (1973\u20131974) as Mary Magdalene.

The premiere was directly broadcast by Radio Television of Belgrade. Bora \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 and Sr\u0111an Marjanovi\u0107, at the time little known musicians, also participated as members of the choir. The production was praised by the Yugoslav public.In 1973, the show opened in Paris at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Chaillot in a French adaptation by Pierre Delano\u00eb.

In the same year, Noel Pearson produced the show at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, Republic of Ireland, with Luke Kelly giving a critically acclaimed performance as King Herod. In 1974, first Spanish-language production ran in Mexico with the title \"Jesucristo Super Estrella\". Julissa played Mary Magdalen.

The production also starred Tim Minchin as Judas, Melanie C as Mary Magdalene and Chris Moyles as King Herod. Lloyd Webber stated, \"The funny thing is that Jesus Christ Superstar [as a rock concert] is what we actually intended it to be. When it is done in a conventional proscenium theatre production it feels shoe-horned in. That is why I wanted to do this.\" The tour resumed in March 2013 in the UK, and an Australian leg of the tour commenced in Perth in May 2013. Andrew O'Keefe played King Herod in Australia, with Jon Stevens as Pilate.
