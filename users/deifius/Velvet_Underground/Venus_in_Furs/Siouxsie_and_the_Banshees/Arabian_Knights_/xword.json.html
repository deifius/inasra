The series is based on the Arabian Nights, a classic work of Middle Eastern literature. The cast includes Henry Corden, Paul Frees, Frank Gerstle, Shari Lewis, Jay North and John Stephenson.\n\n\n== Plot: Secret origins ==\nOnce a peaceful country, Persia was overrun by the powerful forces of the evil conqueror Bakaar the Black Sultan. When all the states of Persia were overthrown, Bakaar invaded the capital city of Baghdad. Bakaar and his forces breached the royal palace and forcibly claimed the throne from Prince Turhan and ordered the prince to be killed. Prince Turhan fled the palace, pursued by the guards of Bakaar. In his escape, the prince is helped by a magician named Fariik who with his magic slipped away from the guards. On their way to the state of El-Rabaul to seek aid from his uncle the Caliph, Turhan and Fariik meet Raseem while being chased by the guards in the Caves of Doom. Raseem tells them that Bakaar's forces have already usurped the throne of El-Rabaul and imprisoned the Caliph and his daughter Princess Nida. The trio then heads to El-Rabaul on Raseem's donkey Zazuum.\nIn El-Rabaul, they rescue Princess Nida who is about to be sold into slavery. There, Princess Nida demonstrates her mastery of disguise and voice mimicry by tricking the guards, but they soon find themselves cornered by Bakaar's men. There Bez jumps into the scene, shapeshifts into an elephant, charges through the guards, and carries everyone to safety. In the Caves of Doom, they decide to form a heroic band and swear to protect their land from the tyranny of Bakaar, thus forming an alliance called the Arabian Knights.\n\n\n== Series direction ==\nArabian Knights was one of several animated miniseries used as filler segments for Hanna-Barbera's Banana Splits Adventure Hour show. Each episode ran between 9 and 10 minutes in length. For the most part, it competed with the other series, namely the animated The Three Musketeers, the part live action, part animated Micro Ventures, and the live action Danger Island segments.\nOften, the general thrust of the Arabian Knights adventures deals with the Knights trying to effect some action against Bakaar\u2019s soldiers, finding a means to further complete their goal of turning the tables on the evil dictator, or dealing with another villain set within the Knights' universe.\nFor the most part, these adventures were done with a semi-serious slant, with a goodly portion of action and comedy mixed in. Hardly anyone was injured or harmed\u2014save for Bakaar's minions (with a usually comic effect), and the episodes usually had an upbeat, happy ending for the Knights.\n\n\n== Characters ==\n\n\n=== The Arabian Knights ===\nPrince Turhan (voiced by Jay North) - The prince of Baghdad and rightful heir to the throne of the Sultan, Turhan is a young and handsome teenage boy. Apart from being brave and bold, he is an agile acrobat, an athlete, and a master swordsman. Turhan gathers a small group of friends to lead a revolt against the tyranny of Bakaar and reclaim his throne to restore the peace and prosperity in his state. Turhan is the de facto leader of the Knights and the driving force behind fighting Bakaar and ending the usurper\u2019s reign. He owns a magic scimitar that can be thrown and returns like a boomerang, in unique ways.\nPrincess Nida (voiced by Shari Lewis) -  Daughter of the Caliph of El-Rabaul, Princess Nida is a lovely teenage girl who is the cousin of Prince Turhan. She is a master of disguise and an expert of voice mimicry. Nida is also skilled in martial arts and can hold her own in the Knights' battles.\nFariik the Magician (voiced by John Stephenson) - A short, tubby, jolly little man, Fariik is a skilled practitioner and spell-master of the mystical arts who lends a magical hand when needed. To cast his spell, Fariik would say his magic words, \"Rosan Kobar.\" He is the first to have offered aid to Turhan after Prince Turhan is deposed by Bakaar. Sometimes, the magic gets very difficult and can take a lot of energy out of him. Fariik can animate carpets and pillows for the occasional airborne transport of the team. Fariik can render himself and others invisible for stealth or camouflage purposes. At times, he can dissolve himself and others into smoke to make an escape from narrow places. He can levitate objects, alter the size of things and persons, create things out of thin air, and alter the form of one thing into another.\nRaseem the Strong (voiced by Frank Gerstle) - A tall muscular man with brief costume and fez, Raseem is the powerhouse of the team with incredible physical strength, endurance, and stamina. He first met Turhan and Fariik when they hid in the Caves of Doom that he occupies. Raseem mistakes them for Bakaar's men and attacks them. However, upon learning they are against Bakaar, he befriends them, and he goes with them to find the Caliph (to get his aid against Bakaar). He often boasts of his strength, saying he is as strong as 30 men. At one time, Raseem said he was as strong as seven elephants. Strong enough to shatter stone walls, lift and catch boulders, catch and throw back cannonballs, and fight off scores of Bakaar\u2019s soldiers at a time, Raseem's power makes for a good equalizer in the Knights' battles.\nZazuum (voiced by Don Messick) - Raseem\u2019s faithful little donkey with long ears, Zazuum was first used by Turhan, Fariik, and Raheem to get to El-Rabaul. Zazuum is quite an intelligent donkey as he aids his fellow team members. Zazuum can spin himself so fast he becomes like a destructive miniature tornado that can defeat any enemy or destroy anything coming his way. He does not like his tail to be pulled, as it enrages him to the point of being a berserk loose cannon that can shatter rocks into pebbles. In addition, Zazuum can smell gold very precisely.\nBez the Beast (voiced by Henry Corden) - A dark-skinned man with a turban and green clothing, Bez can shapeshift into an animal, bird, or aquatic creature from a mighty elephant to a tiny mouse. Often, he triggers this ability by speaking the phrase \u201cSize of a \u2014!\u201d and naming the animal or bird he wishes to turn into, followed by a loud boom that proclaims his transformation. Sometimes the magical phrase is followed by clapping his hands together. If the creature is small enough, Bez can turn into many versions of it such as turning into a million bees. Bez is known to turn into some larger animals which often serve as alternate modes of transportation for the Arabian Knights like an elephant or a camel for land transportation. He can also transform into mythical creatures like a winged stallion or a roc for the occasional airborne transportation. His shapeshifting makes him a handy spy for the Knights in order to find out what Bakaar is planning.\n\n\n=== Villains ===\nBakaar the Black Sultan (voiced by John Stephenson) - The corrupt conqueror and nemesis of the Arabian Knights, Bakaar usurps the throne of Turhan\u2019s father and takes control of Baghdad. Clearly wishing to command all of the kingdoms that bow to Baghdad, he sets all of his forces to the goal of capturing Turhan (and later all of the Knights) to secure his place on the throne. While cruel, Bakaar does not usually involve himself directly in the fight against the Knights. He prefers to let his soldiers and minions to do the job. Bakaar's distinctive manner of dress\u2014a single-spiked, fur-lined helmet in place of a crown\u2014hints at ancestry from the Mongols.\nVangore (voiced by Paul Frees) - Bakaar's enforcer and captain of his guards. Often hatches plots to capture the Knights. Apparently, Vangore's father was a camel driver. He has red hair shaved to a topknot (which would historically be an indication of Galatian ancestry and of being enslaved).\nSundar - Bakaar's court magician.\n\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nArabian Knights at IMDb\n\"Arabian Knights\" at International Hero\n\"Arabian Knights\" at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

It is a first-level story, being told by Scheherazade herself, and contains one second-level story, the Tale of N\u00far al-D\u00edn Al\u00ed and his Son. It occurs early in the Arabian Nights narrative, being started during night 19, after the Tale of Portress. The Tale of N\u00far al-D\u00edn Al\u00ed and his Son starts during night 20, and the cycle ends during night 25, when Scheherazade starts the Tale of the Hunchback.\n\n\n== Plot summary ==\nA fisherman discovers a heavy locked chest along the Tigris river.  He sells it to the Abbasid Caliph, Harun al-Rashid, who then has the chest broken open only to find inside it the dead body of a young woman who was cut into pieces. Harun orders his vizier, Ja'far ibn Yahya, to solve the crime and find the murderer within three days or else he will have him executed. Ja'far, however, fails to find the culprit before the deadline. Just when Harun is about to have Ja'far executed for his failure, a plot twist occurs when two men appear, one a handsome young man and the other an old man, both claiming to be the murderer. Both men argue and call each other liars as each attempts to claim responsibility for the murder. This continues until the young man proves that he is the murderer vastly by accurately describing the chest in which the young woman was found.The young man reveals that he was her husband and the old man her father, who was attempting to save his son-in-law by taking the blame. Harun then demands to know his motives for murdering his wife, and the young man then narrates his reasons as a flashback of events preceding Harun's discovery of the locked chest. He eulogizes her as a faultless wife and mother of his three children, and describes how she one day requested a rare apple when she was ill. He then describes his two-week-long journey to Basra, where he finds three such apples at the Caliph's orchard. On his return to Baghdad, he finds out that she would no longer eat the apples because of her lingering illness. When he returns to work at his shop, he discovered a slave passing by with the same apple. He asked him about it and the slave replied that he received it from his girlfriend, who had three such apples that her husband found for her after a half-month journey. The young man then suspected his wife of unfaithfulness, rushed home, and demanded to know how many apples remained there. After finding one of the apples missing, he drew a knife and killed her. He then describes how he attempted to get rid of the evidence by cutting her body to pieces, wrapping it in multiple layers of shawls and carpets, hiding her body in a locked chest, and abandoning it in the Tigris river. Yet another twist occurs after he returns home and his son confesses to him that he had stolen one of the apples, and a slave had taken it and run off with it. The boy also confesses that he told the slave about his father's quest for the three apples. Out of guilt, the young man concludes his story by requesting Harun to execute him for his unjust murder. Harun, however, refuses to punish the young man out of sympathy, and instead sets Ja'far a new assignment: to find the tricky slave who caused the tragedy within three days, or be executed for his failure.Ja'far yet again fails to find the culprit before the deadline has passed. On the day of the deadline, he is summoned to be executed for his failure. As he bids farewell to all his family members, he hugs his beloved youngest daughter last. It is then, by complete accident, that he discovers a round object in her pocket which she reveals to be an apple with the name of the Caliph written on it. In the story's twist ending, the girl reveals that she brought it from their slave, Rayhan. Ja'far thus realizes that his own slave was the culprit all along. He then finds Rayhan and solves the case as a result. Ja'far, however, pleads to Harun to forgive his slave and, in exchange, narrates to him the Tale of N\u00far al-D\u00edn Al\u00ed and His Son Badr al-D\u00edn Hasan.  The Caliph amazed by the story, pardons the slave. To console the young man who mistakenly killed the wife he loved, the Caliph offers one of his own slaves for a wife, showers him with gifts and cherishes him until his death.\n\n\n== Analysis ==\nThe story has been described as a \"whodunit\" murder mystery. Suspense is generated through multiple plot twists that occur as the story progressed. With these characteristics, it may be considered the oldest known archetype for detective fiction.The main difference between Ja'far and later fictional detectives, such as Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot, is that Ja'far has no actual desire to solve the case. The whodunit mystery is not solved via detective work; rather, it is solved when the murderer himself confesses his crime. This in turn lead to another assignment in which Ja'far has to find the culprit who instigated the murder within three days or else be executed. Ja'far again fails to find the culprit before the deadline, but owing to chance, he discovers a key item. In the end, he manages to solve the case through reasoning in order to prevent his own execution.According to scholar Ulrich Marzolph, the tale is present in \"the oldest surviving manuscript\" of the Arabian Nights compilation, and is considered to be part of \"the core corpus\" of the book.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nPinault, David (1992), Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights, Brill Publishers, pp. 86\u201397, ISBN 90-04-09530-6\nMarzolph, Ulrich (2006), The Arabian Nights Reader, Wayne State University Press, pp. 239\u2013246, ISBN 0-8143-3259-5\nWikisource:The Tale of the Three Apples\n\"The Three Apples\", Burton's translation\nGalland, Antoine, Contes des mille et une nuits (Int\u00e9grale Volumes 1 \u00e0 9) (French Edition), Kindle", "images": [], "summary": "The Three Apples (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0641\u0627\u062d\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0629\u200e), or The Tale of the Murdered Woman (Arabic: \u062d\u0643\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0642\u062a\u0648\u0644\u0629\u200e, romanized: Hikayat as-Sabiyya al-Maqtula), is a story contained in the One Thousand and One Nights collection (also known as the \"Arabian Nights\").
