"The Malpighian layer of the skin is generally defined as both the stratum basale and stratum spinosum as a unit, although it is occasionally defined as the stratum basale specifically, or the stratum spinosum specifically.It is named after Marcello Malpighi.  \nBasal cell carcinoma originates from the basal layer of the rete malpighii of the skin.\nThis layer is where almost all of the mitotic activity in epidermis occurs. The activity of these cells is increased by IL-1 (interleukin 1) and Epidermal growth factor. The activity is decreased by transforming growth factor. \n\n\n== See also ==\nEpidermis\n\n\n== References =="
