"The stratum corneum (Latin for 'horny layer') is the outermost layer of the epidermis. The stratum corneum is the dead tissue that performs protective and adaptive physiological functions including mechanical shear, impact resistance, water flux and hydration regulation, microbial proliferation and invasion regulation, initiation of inflammation through cytokine activation and dendritic cell activity, and selective permeability to exclude toxins, irritants, and allergens.  This layer is composed of 15\u201320 layers of flattened cells with no nuclei and cell organelles. Their cytoplasm shows filamentous keratin.  These corneocytes are embedded in a lipid matrix composed of ceramides, cholesterol, and fatty acids.The stratum corneum functions to form a barrier to protect underlying tissue from infection, dehydration, chemicals and mechanical stress. Desquamation, the process of cell shedding from the surface of the stratum corneum, balances proliferating keratinocytes that form in the stratum basale. These cells migrate through the epidermis towards the surface in a journey that takes approximately fourteen days."
