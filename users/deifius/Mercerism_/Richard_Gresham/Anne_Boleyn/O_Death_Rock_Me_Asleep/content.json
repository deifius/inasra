"\"O Death Rock Me Asleep\" is a Tudor-era poem, traditionally attributed to Anne Boleyn. It was written shortly before her execution in 1536 and after Queen Elizabeth I was born.\n\n\n== Authorship ==\nThe poem is generally attributed to Anne Boleyn, and is assumed to have been composed whilst she was imprisoned in the Tower of London. However, the evidence for Boleyn's authorship is not entirely conclusive. It has been postulated that the poem was actually written by Boleyn's brother Lord Rochford.\n\n\n== Analysis ==\nThe poem was written in the last days of Anne's life and is a reflection on her suffering. In it, she observes that her end cannot be avoided, and that it will at least give her peace and an escape from her present sufferings.\n\n\n=== Structure ===\nThe poem has a fairly loose structure, with most lines either being tetrameter or trimeter. At the end of each major stanza, there is a refrain, varying slightly, about the nearing of death and how it is inevitable.\n\n\n== Text ==\n\nO death! rock me asleep,\nBring me the quiet rest;\nLet pass my weary guiltless ghost\nOut of my careful breast:\nToll on the passing bell,\nRing out the doleful knell,\nLet thy sound my death tell,\nDeath doth draw nigh;\nThere is no remedy.\nMy pains who can express?\nAlas! they are so strong,\nMy dolour will not suffer strength\nMy life for to prolong:\nToll on, thou passing bell,\nRing out my doleful knell,\nLet thy sound my death tell,\nDeath doth draw nigh;\nThere is no remedy.\nAlone in prison strong,\nI wait my destiny,\nWoe worth this cruel hap that I\nShould taste this misery?\nToll on, thou passing bell,\nLet thy sound my death tell,\nDeath doth draw nigh,\nThere is no remedy.\nFarewell my pleasures past,\nWelcome my present pain!\nI feel my torments so increase\nThat life cannot remain.\nCease now,thou passing bell;\nRung is my doleful knell,\nFor the sound my death doth tell,\nDeath doth draw nigh,\nThere is no remedy.\n\n\n== References =="
