footwear. Most boots mainly cover the foot and the ankle, while some also cover some part of the lower calf. Some boots extend up the leg, sometimes as far as the knee or even the hip. Most boots have a heel that is clearly distinguishable from the rest of the sole, even if the two are made of one piece. Traditionally made of leather or rubber, modern boots are made from a variety of materials. Boots are worn both for their functionality \u2013 protecting the foot and leg from water, extreme cold, mud or hazards (e.g., work boots may protect wearers from chemicals or use a steel toe) or providing additional ankle support for strenuous activities with added traction requirements (e.g., hiking), or may have hobnails on their undersides to protect against wear and to get better grip; and for reasons of style and fashion.\nIn some cases, the wearing of boots may be required by laws or regulations, such as the regulations in some jurisdictions requiring workers on construction sites to wear steel-toed safety boots. Some uniforms include boots as the regulated footwear. Boots are recommended as well for motorcycle riders. High-top athletic shoes are generally not considered boots, even though they do cover the ankle, primarily due to the absence of a distinct heel. In Britain football (soccer) cleats are also called boots.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nEarly boots consisted of separate leggings, soles, and uppers worn together to provide greater ankle protection than shoes or sandals.  Around 1000 BC, these components were more permanently joined to form a single unit that covered the feet and lower leg, often up to the knee. A type of soft leather ankle boots were worn by nomads in eastern Asia and carried to China to India and Russia around AD 1200 to 1500 by Mongol invaders. The Inuit and Aleut natives of Alaska developed traditional winter boots of caribou skin or sealskin featuring decorative touches of seal intestine, dog hair and suchlike. 17th century European boots were influenced by military styles, featuring thick soles and turnover tops that were originally designed to protect horse mounted soldiers. In the 1700s, distinctive, thigh-high boots worn by Hessian soldiers fighting in the American Revolutionary War influenced the development of the iconic heeled cowboy boots worn by cattlemen in the American west.\n\n\n== Types and uses ==\n\n\n=== Practical uses ===\n\n \n\nBoots which are designed for walking through snow, shallow water and mud may be made of a single closely stitched design (using leather, rubber, canvas, or similar material) to prevent the entry of water, snow, mud or dirt through gaps between the laces and tongue found in other types of shoes.  Waterproof gumboots are made in different lengths of uppers. In extreme cases, thigh-boots called waders, worn by anglers, extend to the hip.  Such boots may also be insulated for warmth. With the exception of gum boots, boots sold in general retail stores may be considered \"water resistant,\" as they are not usually fully waterproof, compared to high-end boots for fishers or hikers.\nSpeciality boots have been made to protect steelworkers' feet and calves if they accidentally step in puddles of molten metal, to protect workers from a variety of chemical exposure, to protect workers from construction site hazards and to protect feet from extreme cold (e.g., with insulated or inflatable boots for use in Antarctica). Most work boots are \"laceups\" made from leather. Formerly they were usually shod with hobnails and heel- and toe-plates, but now can usually be seen with a thick rubber sole, and often with steel toecaps.Boots are normally worn with socks to prevent chafes and blisters, to absorb sweat, to improve the foot's grip inside the boot, or to insulate the foot from the cold. Before socks became widely available, footwraps were worn instead.\nSpecialty boots have been designed for many different types of sports, particularly riding, skiing, snowboarding, ice-skating, and sporting in wet/damp conditions.\n\n\n=== Fashion and fetish use ===\n\nBovver boots, Doc Martens boots and army boots were adopted by skinheads and punks as part of their typical dress and have migrated to more mainstream fashion, including women's wear. As a more rugged alternative to dress shoes, dress boots may be worn (though these can be more formal than shoes). Fashionable boots for women may exhibit all the variations seen in other fashion footwear: tapered or spike heels, platform soles, pointed toes, zipper closures and the like. The popularity of boots as fashion footwear ebbs and flows. Singer Nancy Sinatra popularized the fad of women wearing boots in the late 1960s with her song \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\". They were popular in the 1960s and 1970s (particularly knee-high boots), but diminished in popularity towards the end of the 20th century. In the 2010s, they experienced a resurgence in popularity, especially designs with a long bootleg. Boot bolos, boot bracelets, boot straps, boot chains, and boot harnesses are used to decorate boots. Sandal boots also exist.\n\nBoots have become the object of sexual attraction for some people and they have become a standard accessory in the BDSM scene (where leather, latex and PVC boots are favoured) and a fashion accessory in music videos. Knee- or thigh-high leather boots are worn by some strippers and pornography models and actresses. Boots have even become a sexual fetish for devotees known as boot fetishists and foot fetishists.\n\n\n== Boot parts and accessories ==\n\nSpats\nBoot jack\nFor the parts of a boot, see Hiking boot#Parts\n\n\n== As symbols ==\n\n\n=== In heraldry ===\n\nAs boots have been used by riders for millennia, they were used by knights. As a consequence, albeit not common, boots came to be used as charges in heraldry.\nBecause of the origin of heraldry as insignia used by mounted warriors like the medieval knights, when boots are used in heraldry, they are often displayed as riding boots, even if the blazon might not specify it as such. They are sometimes adorned with spurs, which may or may not have another tincture (colour) than the boot and the background field.\nBoots were also used in coats of arms of shoemakers' guilds and in shop signs outside their shops.\n\n\n=== Idioms and cultural references ===\n\nBoots that are particularly old and well worn, or a similarly tough item are referred to as being tough and strong with the phrase \"tough as old boots.\"\nA discarded boot may be used in the construction of a musical instrument known as the \"mendoza.\"\nTall (high) boots may have a tab, loop or handle at the top known as a bootstrap, allowing one to use fingers or a tool to provide better leverage in getting the boots on. The figurative use  \"to pull one's self up by one's bootstraps\" in the sense of \"ability to perform a difficult task without external help\" developed in the 19th century  in US English. The term \"bootstrapping\" was subsequently used in a metaphorical sense in a number of fields, notably computing (which uses the term \"bootup\" to describe the process of starting a computer and in entrepreneurship, which uses the term \"bootstrapping\" to describe start-up companies which are launched without major external financing.\nTo \"die with one's boots on\" means to die while one is still actively involved in work or to go down fighting. Popularized by Wild West movies.\nBoot camp: a colloquial term for the initial recruit training of a new recruit enlisting in a military organization or armed force. In this context, a \"boot\" is just such a recruit.\nStormtroopers and other agents of authority or units used for political strongarm tactics such as intimidation are typically referred to by their detractors as \"jackbooted thugs,\" a reference to the hobnailed military jackboot of the World War I German Stormtrooper and later Nazi uniform. Authoritarian rule, either by hostile military forces, or by groups of armed intimidators, is imposed by \"jackboot tactics.\"\nTo \"give one the boot\" means to kick one out (of a job, a club, etc.) or expel one, either literally or figuratively.\nTo \"put the boot in\" is an idiom for inflicting violence on someone.\n\"The boot is on the other foot now\" means that a situation has become reversed\u2014a previous victor is now losing, for example.\nWearing \"seven-league boots\" references a classic children's fairy tale and indicates that a person or company can cover great distances, figuratively or literally, in a single stride.\nTo \"shake/quake in one's boots\" means to be very frightened, and is mostly used sarcastically.\n\"Knocking boots\" is slang for having sex, regardless of whether either person is wearing boots.\nThe country of Italy is referred to as \"lo Stivale\" (the Boot) due to its shape.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of boots\nBoot cut\nBoot fetishism\nBoot throwing\nGumboot dance\nWellie wanging\n\n\n== References ==", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/A-12_OXCART_Flight_Suit_Boots_-_Flickr_-_The_Central_Intelligence_Agency.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/AGM_Ancient_Greek_Pair_of_Terracotta_Boots.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Aa_hobnailedboots_01.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Blason_Aresches.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Cowboy_boots.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/Dr_Martens%2C_black%2C_old.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/Emojione_1F458.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Fashion_boot_terminology.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Fieldboots.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/HooksAndBootjack.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/New-Rock-boots.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Oxhide_boots._Loulan%2C_Xinjiang._Early_Han_220_BCE_-_8_CE.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/PinkVisual_boots.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/S3_safety_footwear.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Stiefelwiki1e.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1c/Wiki_letter_w_cropped.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/%D0%AD%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%82_%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%88%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%B2_%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B5_%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%B0_-_%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%B3%D1%83%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B0._%D0%9C%D1%83%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%B9%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BF%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81_%D0%A6%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B6%D0%B8%D0%BD_%D0%91%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B3%2C_%D0%9C%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%8F.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/db/Symbol_list_class.svg"], "summary": "A boot, plural boots, is a type of specific footwear.

Sources report cashmere crafts were introduced by Sayeed Ali Hamadani, when in the 14th century he came to Ladakh. He found that the Ladakhi Kashmiri goats produced soft wool. He took some of this goat wool and made socks which he gave as a gift to the king of Kashmir, Sultan Qutabdin.  Afterwards, Hamadani suggested to the king that they start a shawl weaving industry in Kashmir using this wool. That is how pashmina shawls began. The United Nations agency UNESCO reported in 2014 that Ali Hamadani was one of the principal historical figures who shaped the culture of Kashmir, both architecturally and through the flourishing of arts and crafts, and hence economy, in Kashmir. The skills and knowledge that he brought to Kashmir gave rise to an entire industry.Kashmir was a pivotal point through which the wealth, knowledge, and products of ancient India passed to the world. Perhaps the most widely known woven textiles are the famed Kashmir shawls. The Kanikar, for instance, has intricately woven designs that are formalized imitations of Nature. The Chinar leaf (plane tree leaf), apple and cherry blossoms, the rose and tulip, the almond and pear, the nightingale\u2014these are done in deep mellow tones of maroon, dark red, gold yellow and browns. Yet another type of Kashmir shawl is the Jamiavr, which is a brocaded woollen fabric sometimes in pure wool and sometimes with a little cotton added.\n\nThe floral design appears in a heavy, close embroidery-like weave in dull silk or soft pashmina (Persian, meaning \"woolen\"), and usually comprises small or large flowers delicately sprayed and combined; some shawls have net-like patterns with floral ensemble motifs in them. Still another type of Kashmir shawl is the double-sided Dourukha (Persian, meaning \"having two faces\"), a woven shawl that is so done as to produce the same effect on both sides. This is a unique piece of craftsmanship, in which a multi-coloured schematic pattern is woven all over the surface, and after the shawl is completed, the rafugar (expert embroiderer) works the outlines of the motifs in darker shades to bring into relief the beauty of design. This attractive mode of craftsmanship not only produces a shawl which is reversible because of the perfect workmanship on both sides, but it combines the crafts of both weaving and embroidery and religious beliefs expressed in different shawls.\nThe most expensive shawls, called shahtoosh, are made from the under-fleece of the Tibetan antelope or Chiru. These shawls are so fine that even a very tightly woven shawl can be easily pulled through a small finger ring.\nThe naksha, a Persian device like the Jacquard loom invented centuries later, enabled Indian weavers to create sinuous floral patterns and creeper designs in brocade to rival any painted by a brush. The Kashmir shawl that evolved from this expertise in its heyday had greater fame than any other Indian textile. Always a luxury commodity, the intricate, tapestry-woven, fine wool shawl had become a fashionable wrap for the ladies of the English and French elite by the 18th century. Supply fell short of demand and manufacturers pressed to produce more, created convincing embroidered versions of the woven shawls that could be produced in half the time. As early as 1803, Kashmiri needlework production was established to increase and hasten output of these shawls, which had been imitated in England since 1784 and even in France. By 1870, the advent of the Jacquard loom in Europe destroyed the exclusivity of the original Kashmir shawl, which began to be produced in Paisley, Scotland. Even the characteristic Kashmiri motif, the mango-shape, began to be known simply as the paisley.\n\nThe paisley motif is so ubiquitous to Indian fabrics that it is hard to realize that it is only about 250 years old. It evolved from 1600s floral and tree-of-life designs that were created in expensive, tapestry-woven Mughal textiles. The design in India originated from Persian motif called butta-jeghgha which represents a stylized cypress tree, the symbol of Iranians. Early designs depicted single plants with large flowers and thin wavy stems, small leaves and roots. As the designs became denser over time, more flowers and leaves were compacted within the shape of the tree, or issuing from vases or a pair of leaves. By the late 18th century, the archetypal curved point at the top of an elliptical outline had evolved. The elaborate paisley created on Kashmir shawls became the vogue in Europe for over a century, and it was imitations of these shawls woven in factories at Paisley, Scotland, that gave it the name paisley still commonly used in the United States and Europe. In the late 18th century and 19th century, the paisley became an important motif in a wide range of Indian textiles, perhaps because it was associated with the Mughal court. It also caught the attention of poorer and non-Muslim Indians because it resembles a mango. Cashmere Shawl is an evergreen shawl in all over india and in the world. \"Rural Indians called an aam or mango a symbol of fertility\".The first shawls, or \"shals\", were used in Assyrian times; later they went into widespread use in the Middle East. Shawls were also part of the traditional male costume in Kashmir. They were woven in extremely fine woollen twill, some such as the Orenburg shawl, were even said to be as fine as the Shatoosh. They could be in one colour only, woven in different colours (called tilikar), ornately woven or embroidered (called ameli).\n\nKashmiri shawls were high-fashion garments in Western Europe in the early- to mid-19th century. Paisley shawls, imitation Kashmiri shawls woven in Paisley, Renfrewshire, are the origin of the name of the traditional paisley pattern. Shawls were also manufactured in the city of Norwich, Norfolk from the late 18th century (and some two decades before Paisley) until about the 1870s.\nSilk shawls with fringes, made in China, were available by the first decade of the 19th century. Ones with embroidery and fringes were available in Europe and the Americas by 1820. These were called China cr\u00eape shawls or China shawls, and in Spain mantones de Manila because they were shipped to Spain from China via the port of Manila. The importance of these shawls in fashionable women's wardrobes declined between 1865 and 1870 in Western culture. However, they became part of folk dress in a number of places including Germany, the Near East, various parts of Latin America, and Spain where they became a part of Romani (gitana) dress especially in Andalusia and Madrid. These embroidered items were revived in the 1920s under the name of Spanish shawls.  Their use as part of the costume of the lead in the opera Carmen contributed to the association of the shawls with Spain rather than China.\nSome cultures incorporate shawls of various types into their national folk dress, mainly because the relatively unstructured shawls were much more commonly used in earlier times.\n\n\n== Usage ==\n\nShawls are used in order to keep warm, to complement a costume, and for symbolic reasons. One famous type of shawl is the tallit, worn by Jewish men during prayers and ceremonies. Today, shawls are worn for added warmth (and fashion) at outdoor or indoor evening affairs, where the temperature is warm enough for men in suits, but not for women in dresses and where a jacket might be inappropriate.\n\n\n== Types ==\n\n\n=== The Kashmir shawls ===\n\nThe Kashmir shawl is a type of shawl distinctive for its Kashmiri weave, and traditionally made of shahtoosh or pashmina wool. Known for its warmth, light weight and characteristic buta design, the Kashmir shawl was originally used by Mughal royalty and nobility. In the late 18th century, it arrived in Europe, where its use by Queen Victoria and Empress Jos\u00e9phine popularised it as a symbol of exotic luxury and status. It became a toponym for the Kashmir region itself (as cashmere), inspiring mass-produced imitation industries in India and Europe, and popularising the buta, today known as the Paisley motif. \"The shawls made in Kashmir occupy a pre-eminent place among textile products; and it is to them and to their imitations from Western looms that specific importance attaches. The Kashmir shawl is characterized by the elaboration of its design, in which the \"cone\" pattern is a prominent feature, and by the glowing harmony, brilliance, depth, and enduring qualities of its colours. The basis of these excellences is found in the very fine, soft, short, flossy under-wool, called pashm or pashmina, found on the shawl-goat, a variety of Capra hircus inhabiting the elevated regions of Tibet. There are several varieties of pashm, but the finest is a strict monopoly of the maharaja of Kashmir. Inferior pashm and Kerman wool \u2014 a fine soft Persian sheep's wool \u2014 are used for shawl weaving at Amritsar and other places in the Punjab, where colonies of Kashmiri weavers are established. Of shawls, apart from shape and pattern, there are only two principal classes: (1) loom-woven shawls called tiliwalla, tilikar or kani kar \u2014 sometimes woven in one piece, but more often in small segments which are sewn together with such precision that the sewing is quite imperceptible; and (2) embroidered shawls \u2014 amlikar \u2014 in which over a ground of plain pashmina is worked by needle a minute and elaborate pattern.\" from Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1911 \n\n\n=== Pashmina or kar Amir ===\n\nThe majority of the woollen fabrics of Kashmir, and particularly the best quality shawls, were and are still made of Pashm or Pashmina, which is the wool of Capra hircus, a species of the wild Asian mountain goat. Hence the shawls came to be called Pashmina. The fine fleece used for the shawls is that which grows under the rough, woolly, outer coat of the animal; that from the under-belly, which is shed on the approach of hot weather. Materials of an inferior grade were of the wool of the wild Himalayan mountain sheep or the Himalayan ibex. However, the best fleece wool is soft, silky and warm is of the wild goats, and painstakingly gathered from shrubs and rough rocks against which the animals rub off their fleece on the approach of summer. This was undoubtedly the soft fleece wool from which were made the famous and much coveted 'ring shawls' in Mughal times. Unfortunately very inferior and second rate wool taken from domesticated sheep and goats provide most of the wool used today on the looms of Kashmir.\nThe needle-worked Amlikar or Amli, made from Pashmina wool is a shawl embroidered almost all over with the needle on a plain woven ground. The colours most commonly seen on pashmina shawls are yellow, white, black, blue, green, purple, crimson and scarlet. The design motifs are usually formalised imitations of nature like the leaf, flower and tree designs mentioned above; they are always done in rich colours.\nThe embroidery stitch employed is rather like the parallel darning stitch and is rarely allowed to penetrate the entire fabric.\nThe outlines of the design are further touched up and emphasized with silk or woollen thread of different colours run round the finer details; the stitch used for this is at an angle overlapping darn stitch, all the stitches used are so minute and fine that individually they can be seen with the unaided eye only with difficulty. When Pashmina wool is used for the embroidery work, it is made to blend so intimately with the texture of the basic shawl material that it would be difficult to insert even a fine needle between the embroidery stitches and the basic fabric.\n\n\n=== Do-Shalla ===\nThe Emperor Akbar was a great admirer of the shawls of Kashmir.  It was he who began the fashion of wearing them in duplicate, sewn back to back, so that the under surfaces of the shawls were never seen. During that time the most desired shawls were those worked in gold and silver thread or shawls with border ornamented with fringes of gold, silver and silk thread.\nThe Do-shala, as the name designates (\"two-shawl\"), are always sold in pairs, there being many varieties of them. In the Khali-matan the central field is quite plain and without any ornamentation. The Char-bagan is made up of four pieces in different colours neatly joined together; the central fluid of the shawl is embellished with a medallion of flowers. However, when the field is ornamented with flowers in the four corners we have the Kunj.\nPerhaps the most characteristic of the Kashmir shawls is the one made like patchwork. The patterns are woven on the looms in long strips, about twelve to eighteen inches in length and from one half to two inches in width. These design strips, made on very simple and primitive looms, are then cut to the required lengths and very neatly and expertly hand sewn together with almost invisible stitches and finally joined by sewing to a plain central field piece. As a variation, pieces may be separately woven, cut up in various shapes of differing sizes and expertly sewn together and then further elaborated with embroidery. But there is a difference between these two types: while the patchwork loom shawls are made up from separate narrow strips, the patchwork embroidered shawls consists of a certain number of irregularly shaped pieces joined together, each one balancing the predominant colour scheme of the shawl.\n\n\n=== Namda and Gabba ===\nThe basic material for a gubba is milled blanket dyed in plain colour. Embroidery is bold and vivid in designing and done with woollen or cotton threads. Gubbas have more of a folk flavour blankets cut and patched into geometric patterns, with limited, embroidery on joining and open space. It is more like appliqu\u00e9 work. Colours are bright and attractive. They are cheap and used for dewan covering or as floor covering\u2014namdas.\n\n\n=== Knit shawls ===\n\nTriangular knit lace shawls are usually knitted from the neck down, and may or may not be shaped. In contrast, Faroese lace shawls are knitted bottom up and contain a centre back gusset. Each shawl consists of two triangular side panels, a trapezoid-shaped back gusset, an edge treatment, and usually also shoulder shaping.\n\n\n=== Shalli ===\nShalli is a handwoven twill weaved shawl made of angora goat hairs.\n\n\n=== Stole ===\n\nA stole is a woman's shawl, especially a formal shawl of expensive fabric, used around the shoulders over a party dress or ball gown.  A stole is narrower than a typical shawl and of simpler construction than a cape; it is a length of a quality material, wrapped and carried about the shoulders or arms.  Lighter materials such as silk and chiffon are simply finished, that is, cropped, hemmed, and bound; heavier materials such as fur and brocade are often lined as well.\nA stole can also be a fur or set of furs, usually fox, worn as a stole with a suit or gown; the pelage or skin, of a single animal (head included) is generally used with street dress while for formal wear a finished length of fur using the skins of more than one animal is used; the word stole stands alone or is used in combination: fur stole, mink stole, the namesake of Dreamlander Mink Stole.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCape\nCloak\nHaapsalu shawl\nPa\u00f1uelo\nPoncho\nRuana\nSerape\nTallit\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBhatnagar, Parul (2004).

It covers the genitals and, at least partially, the buttocks.\n\n\n== History and types ==\nLoincloths are worn in societies where no other clothing is needed or wanted. Loincloths are commonly used as an undergarment or swimsuit by wrestlers and by farmers in paddy fields in both Sri Lanka and India, where it is called Kovanam in Tamil, amudaya in Sinhala and kaupinam  or langot.\nThe loincloth, or breechcloth, is a basic form of dress, often worn as the only garment. Men have worn a loincloth as a fundamental piece of clothing which covers their genitals, not the buttocks, in most societies which disapproved of genital nakedness throughout human history. The loincloth is in essence a piece of material, bark-bast, leather, or cloth, passed between the legs and covering the genitals. Despite its functional simplicity, the loincloth comes in many different forms.\n\nA breechcloth, or breechclout, consists of a strip of material (bark, cloth, leather) passed between the thighs and secured by a belt. A loincloth is a long piece of cloth, passed between the thighs and wound around the waist.The styles in which breechcloths and loincloths can be arranged are myriad. Both the Bornean sirat and the Indian dhoti have fabric pass between the legs to support a man's genitals.\nA similar style of loincloth was also characteristic of ancient Mesoamerica. The male inhabitants of the area of modern Mexico wore a wound loincloth of woven fabric. One end of the loincloth was held up, the remainder passed between the thighs, wound about the waist, and secured in back by tucking.\n\nIn Pre-Columbian South America, ancient Inca men wore a strip of cloth between their legs held up by strings or tape as a belt. The cloth was secured to the tapes at the back and the front portion hung in front as an apron, always well ornamented. The same garment, mostly in plain cotton but whose aprons are now, like T-shirts, sometimes decorated with logos, is known in Japan as etchu fundoshi.\nSome of the culturally diverse Amazonian indigenous still wear an ancestral type of loincloth.Japanese men wore until recently a loincloth known as a fundoshi. The fundoshi is a 35-centimetre-wide (14 in) piece of fabric (cotton or silk) passed between the thighs and secured to cover the genitals.\n\n\n== Breechcloth ==\n\nA breechcloth, or breechclout, is a form of loincloth consisting in a strip of material\u2014usually a narrow rectangle\u2014passed between the thighs and held up in front and behind by a belt or string. Often, the flaps hang down in front and back.\n\n\n=== India ===\nUnsewn Kaupinam and its later-era sewn variation langot are traditional clothes in India, worn as underwear in dangal held in akharas especially wrestling, to prevent hernias and hydrocele. Kacchera is mandatory for Sikhs to wear.\n\n\n=== Native Americans ===\n\nIn most Native American tribes, men used to wear some form of breechcloth, often with leggings. The style differed from tribe to tribe. In many tribes, the flaps hung down in front and back; in others, the breechcloth looped outside the belt and was tucked into the inside, for a more fitted look. Sometimes, the breechcloth was much shorter and a decorated apron panel was attached in front and behind.A Native American woman or teenage girl might also wear a fitted breechcloth underneath her skirt, but not as outerwear. However, in many tribes young girls did wear breechcloths like the boys until they became old enough for skirts and dresses. Among the Mohave people of the American Southwest, a breechcloth given to a young female symbolically recognizes her status as hwame.\n\n\n=== Europeans ===\nSome European men around 2000 BCE wore leather breechcloths, as can be seen from the clothing of \u00d6tzi. Ancient Romans wore a type of loincloth known as a subligaculum.\nThe use of breechcloths took on common use by the Metis and Acadians and are mentioned as early as the 1650s. In the 1740s and 50s they were issued to the Canadien as part of their war uniform and in 1755 they even tried to issue them to soldiers from France.\n\"During their travels across Canada, the French [canadiens] dress as the Indians; they do not wear breeches.\" \u2013 Peter Kalm 1749. \"Those who go to war receive a capot, two cotton shirts, one breechclout, one pair of leggings, on blanket, one pair of souliers de boeuf, a wood-handled knife, a worm and a musket when they do not bring any. The breechclout is a piece of broadcloth draped between the thighs in the Native manner and with the two ends held by a belt. One wears it without breeches to walk more easily in the woods.\" \u2013 d\u2019Aleyrac, 1755\u201360. \u201cDuring the week the men went about in their homes dressed much like the Indians, namely, in stockings and shoes like theirs, with garters, and a girdle about the waist; otherwise the clothing was like that of other Frenchmen.\u201d (Kalm, p. 558)\n\n\n=== Japanese ===\nJapanese men traditionally wore a breechcloth known as a fundoshi.
