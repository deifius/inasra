"Lebanese cuisine (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0628\u062e \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646\u064a\u200e) is the culinary traditions and practices originating from Lebanon. It includes an abundance of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, fresh fish and seafood. Poultry is eaten more often than red meat, and when red meat is eaten, it is usually lamb and goat meat. It also includes copious amounts of garlic and olive oil, often seasoned with lemon juice. Chickpeas and parsley are also staples of the Lebanese diet.Well-known savoury dishes include baba ghanouj, a dip made of char-grilled eggplant; falafel, small deep-fried balls or patties made of highly spiced ground chickpeas, fava beans, or a combination of the two; and shawarma, a sandwich with marinated meat skewered and cooked on large rods. An important component of many Lebanese meals is hummus, a dip or spread made of blended chickpeas, tahini, lemon juice, and garlic, typically eaten with flatbread.A well-known dessert is baklava, which is made of layered filo (thinly rolled pastry) filled with nuts and steeped in date syrup or honey. Some desserts are specifically prepared on special occasions; for example, meghli (rice pudding dessert, spiced with anise, caraway, and cinnamon) is served to celebrate a newborn baby in the family.Arak is an anise-flavoured moonshine, and is the Lebanese national drink, usually served with a traditional convivial Lebanese meal. Another historic and traditional drink is Lebanese wine.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nLebanese cuisine has ancient roots and is part of the cuisine of the Levant. Many dishes in Lebanese cuisine can be traced back thousands of years to eras of Roman, Greek, Persian, Neo-Babylonian, Byzantine, Arab, Egyptian, and Phoenician rule.In the last 500 years, Lebanese cuisine has been influenced by the different foreign civilizations that held power. From 1516 to 1918, the Ottoman Turks controlled Lebanon and introduced a variety of foods that have become staples in the Lebanese diet, such as cooking with lamb. \nAfter the Ottomans were defeated in World War I (1914\u20131918), France took control of Lebanon until 1943, when the country achieved its independence. The French introduced foods such as flan, a caramel custard dessert dating back to the 16th century AD, eclairs, french fries and croissants.The Lebanese diaspora who live worldwide have introduced new ingredients, spices and culinary practices into Lebanese cuisine, keeping the cuisine innovative and renowned both beyond and within its borders.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nMost often, foods are grilled, baked or lightly cooked in olive oil; butter or cream is rarely used, other than in a few desserts. Vegetables are often eaten raw, pickled, or cooked. \nLike most Mediterranean countries, much of what the Lebanese eat is dictated by the seasons and what is available. Lebanese cuisine also varies by region. \n\nSouth Lebanon is famous for its kibbe, the Beqaa Valley for its meat pastries (such as sfiha), and north Lebanon and Saida (Sidon) for its sweets.In Lebanon, very rarely are drinks served without being accompanied by food. Similar to the tapas of Spain, mezeluri of Romania and aperitivo of Italy, mezze is an array of small dishes placed before the guests creating an array of colors, flavors, textures and aromas. This style of serving food is less a part of family life than it is of entertaining and caf\u00e9s. \nMezze may be as simple as raw or pickled vegetables, hummus, baba ghanouj and bread, or it may become an entire meal consisting of grilled marinated seafood, skewered meats and a variety of cooked and raw salads and an arrangement of desserts. The assortments of dishes forming the mezze are generally consumed in small bites using a piece of flatbread.A typical mezze will consist of an elaborate variety of 30 or so hot and cold dishes, which may include:\n\nSalads such as tabbouleh and fattoush\nDips like hummus, baba ghanoush and moutabal\nKebbeh, kafta and falafel (fried chickpea balls)\nSome patties such as the sambusac\nStuffed grape leaves and pickles\nRoasted nuts, olives and vegetables\nCondiments like toum and taratour, ideal for spread on sfihaWhen dining as a family, the mezze typically consists of three or four dishes, but when served in the restaurant, the mezze can range from 20 to 60 dishes, as the variant combinations and dishes involved are plenty.Family cuisine also offers a range of dishes, such as stews (yakhneh) which can be cooked in many forms depending on the ingredients used and are usually served with meat and rice.Although simple fresh fruits are often served towards the end of a Lebanese meal, there is also dessert, such as baklava and coffee.  When sweets are not available, fruits are typically eaten after meals, including figs, oranges and other citrus fruits, apples, grapes, cherries and green plums (janarek). Although baklava is the most internationally known dessert, there is a great variety of Lebanese desserts.\n\n\n== Dishes and ingredients ==\nLebanese dishes are heavily influenced by the multiple civilisations that have existed within the region, which has accumulated together to form the modern Lebanese cuisine we know today. Using fresh, flavourful ingredients and spices, Lebanese cuisine combines Turkish, Arab, and French cooking styles. Characteristics include the use of lamb (introduced by the Ottomans); the abundant use of nuts, especially almonds and pine nuts; and dressings made from lemon juice.\n\n\n=== Bread ===\nThe Lebanese use bread, usually flatbread, as an integral part of a meal and food is generally not served without it. Pita bread with a pocket, known as khubz Arabi (Arab bread), is widely popular, and may be cut or torn up to dip in various dishes, or be stuffed as a sandwich or wrap with ingredients such as falafel or shawarma. Taboon bread is traditionally baked in a taboon oven or a tannur, and is similar to the various tandoor breads found in many parts of Asia.Marquq is prepared much thinner, almost paper thin, and cooked on a metal saj or pan.Ka'ak is another common Lebanese street bread that is usually consumed as a snack. There are many variations of ka'ak, from being sprinkled with traditional sesame seeds to being stuffed with cheese and za'atar.Manaeesh (mini-pizza) traditionally garnished with cheese (kashk, in its Lebanese version), za'atar, spicy diced tomatoes and may be eaten for breakfast. These are made in many variants in a number of local bakeries or furns. Some bakeries allow customers to bring their own toppings in order to build their own customized manaeesh for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.Variants include manakousheh za'atar (thyme pizza) and manakousheh jebneh which has only cheese.Manaeesh dough can also be eaten with minced meat and onions which is called lahm bi 'ajin. Mini versions are called sfeeha. The same dough can be made into a triangular pie called fatayer, filled with spinach, onions and sumac.\n\n\n=== Dairy ===\nCheese, as well as yogurt and eggs, are commonly used in Lebanon. One of the more recognizable dishes within Lebanon is labneh. Unlike regular yogurt, labneh is strained so as to remove the watery whey, leaving a thicker, creamier consistency. It is spreadable and garnished with olive oil and sea salt. It is an extremely versatile dish that can be served in a mezze platter for either breakfast or dinner.  A variant is mixed with garlic.Ejjeh is the traditional omelette of Lebanon. It is made with egg, chopped parsley and scallions. Within Lebanon, people make this omelette with different herbs that are cultivated from their village.\n\n\n==== Cheeses ====\nAckawi (also akkawi), is a salty white cheese made from pasteurized cow's milk but can also be made with goat's or sheep's milk.\nBaladi cheese has a mild yet rich flavor. It is called the \"cheese of the mountains\" since it is made in the high mountains by local shepherds in Lebanon.\nFeta is used in salads and other dishes, although some cooks will use a milder cheese called jibtieh baidha (simply \"white cheese\").\nHalloum is a semi-hard unripened cheese, perfect for grilling and frying. Along with akkawi, it is traditionally stored in brine, giving it a strong, salty taste, though modern methods have allowed fresher varieties with less salt.\nKashkaval is a cheese popular in many Eastern European countries that has made its way into Lebanese cuisine. It melts very quickly and is practical for pasta, pizza and sandwiches.\nNabulsi is similar to halloumi, made by boiling fresh ackawi cheese in a mixture of spices and seeds which are then fried, grilled or eaten and used in the popular dessert knafeh, a cheese pastry soaked in a sugar-based syrup.\nShanklish is made from cow's milk, salted, fermented and seasoned with thyme and pepper and formed into cheese balls, coated in red pepper chilli flakes.\n\n\n=== Stews ===\nLebanese stews, often served with rice or flatbread, are made with ingredients found locally available. \n\nOkra and tomato stew ( \u0628\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0632\u064a\u062a, bamieh bi-zeit) is one of the most popular. Traditionally, it is served with rice and a basic salad dressed with lemon juice and olive oil, with fresh warm bread. This stew combines the distinct flavor of okra with a flavourful tomato sauce. An alternative version, bamya bel lahmeh, adds small pieces of filleted lamb or beef that have been saut\u00e9ed beforehand to avoid a boiled taste.\nBean stews are common where various beans are grown. An example of a mixed bean Lebanese stew is makhlouta made of a variety of beans, wheat, and legumes, popular in the town of Baskinta. Others include fava bean stew, kidney bean stew (fasoulya hamanieh) and another kidney and lentil stew called mjadrat fasoulya popular in Rashaya. Taro and lentil stew (abu shoushe) and spinach stew (yakhnet sabanikh) are a few of the others available.Mulukhiyah is a stew with mallow leaves, chicken, beef, and in the Lebanese fashion, topped with raw chopped onions, and vinegar. In northern Lebanon, one like mulukhiyah is called mloukhiye b'zeit, made using fresh leaves and shoots of the Nalta jute plant, cooked with olive oil, onions, garlic, tomatoes and chilli peppers, a popular summer side dish, especially in Miniyeh-Danniyeh and Akkar districts.In summer one of the easiest and simplest ways to make use of the abundant summer zucchini is mfaraket koussa (spicy zucchini stew). Daoud bacha, another meat-based stew, consists of beef meatballs (also lamb) with cinnamon, parsley, and stuffed with pinenuts in a tomato sauce.\n\n\n=== Vegetarian ===\nVegetarian cuisine plays an important role in the cuisine of Lebanon. Being located in the Levant, vegetables and herbs (wild or cultivated) are abundant in the fertile landscape and serve as a main base of the cuisine. Some of the most popular street foods in Lebanon are vegetarian including fava beans, hot roasted peanuts served in a paper cone, prickly pears (served peeled and on ice), ful medames (fava beans) and balila (chickpeas seasoned with cumin).Nearly everything can be cooked either with meat or b\u2019zeit (oil), from beans to fish, stews and spinach. Meat was traditionally precious and usually served on a Sunday, but was expensive and usually eaten with bulgur or rice to prolong the shelf life. \n\nFor Lebanese Christians, including Catholic (Maronites and Melkites) and Orthodox, fasting from meat is practiced over the Lenten period (from midnight to noon) during Easter. Where abstention of meat is observed, the food is referred to as akl aateh (meaning food \"cut\" from the diet, such as meat or absent from meat), the particular food that is \"cut\" varies over different traditions.\n\n\n==== Salads ====\n\nFattoush (also called \"peasants' salad\") is made with pita, cucumbers, tomatoes, chickweed, and mint.\nTabbouleh is a diced parsley salad with bulgur wheat, tomato, mint and served with lettuce, eaten within a mezze or as a standalone dish as a precursor to a main course.Yogurt cheese salad consists of shanklish balls (yogurt cheese, feta, chilli powder, thyme, cumin, salt and pepper) added to a freshly prepared salad. It is distinctively Lebanese as is a perfect addition for mezze, complimenting Arab and Lebanese wines.\n\n\n==== Stuffed dishes ====\nWara' enab (\u0648\u0631\u0642 \u0639\u0646\u0628) is a dish commonly served as a mezze (appetizer), stuffed with either rice and meat or just rice. Another stuffed dish kousa mahshi (\u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u062a\u062d\u0636\u064a\u0631) consists of various kinds of squash or zucchini stuffed with rice and sometimes meat and cooked on the stovetop or in the oven.\n\n\n==== Chickpea-based dishes ====\nChickpea dishes include falafel (deep-fried balls or patties made of highly spiced ground chickpeas), hummus (a popular dip for pita bread made of blended chickpeas, sesame tahini, lemon juice, and garlic) and its variants including, hummus ras asfour (with meat on top) and fateh b'hummus, (a dish of chickpeas, flatbread pieces and spiced yogurt). Balila (cumin chickpeas), is a simple yet popular Lebanese dish that has been boiled along with lemon juice, garlic and various spices.\n\n\n==== Aubergine-based dishes ====\nAubergine (eggplant) dishes are common in Lebanon. They include well-known dishes such as baba ghanouj (a char-grilled aubergine, made with tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, and garlic puree), mutabbel (mashed cooked aubergines and tahini, mixed with salt, pepper, olive oil, with anar seeds) and makdous, a stuffed eggplant dish served with olive oil.Fried aubergine is also served alongside other fried vegetables including potatoes, cauliflower, courgettes (zucchinis), onions and tomatoes, usually referred to as a \"mixed fry up\".One of the most popular dishes in the Levant is fatteh, and the popular variant fatet batinjan (eggplant casserole) is served with yoghurt, fried bread,  aubergine, and mat\u00e9.Unlike the Greek style, Lebanese moussaka is a vegetarian eggplant dish, made with fried eggplant simmered in an onion and tomato sauce with chickpeas.\n\n\n==== Bean and legume dishes ====\nLebanese-style ful (cooked fava beans) is a slow-cooked mash of brown beans, sometimes with chickpeas, dressed with lemon, olive oil, and cumin. Riz bil-foul is another dish with fava beans, seasoned with various spices and served with rice.Mujaddara (imjaddarra) is a popular dish found throughout the Middle East and consists of cooked lentils together with wheat or rice, garnished with sauteed onions.\n\n\n=== Meats ===\nLebanese meat dishes are usually made with chicken or lamb, though pork is also eaten (albeit not as widely, due to Islamic dietary laws). However, meat is expensive everywhere and not always readily available. \n\n\n==== Mixed meat ====\nShawarma is a commonly found form of street food made with slow-cooked skewered meat (either chicken, lamb or beef) that is thinly sliced and served as a sandwich with toppings such as onions, pickles and tomatoes.

Kafta is served with bread and other side dishes.\n\n\n==== Lamb ====\nHabra (raw lamb fillet) is essential for most dishes involving lamb. It is the foundation for many popular dishes including kibbeh nayyeh (minced raw lamb) and other variants of kibbeh. The fillet needs to be prepared and chilled for a minimum of 2 hours, and can even be prepared one day in advance.
