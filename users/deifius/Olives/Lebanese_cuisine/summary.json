Chickpeas and parsley are also staples of the Lebanese diet.Well-known savoury dishes include baba ghanouj, a dip made of char-grilled eggplant; falafel, small deep-fried balls or patties made of highly spiced ground chickpeas, fava beans, or a combination of the two; and shawarma, a sandwich with marinated meat skewered and cooked on large rods.

Some desserts are specifically prepared on special occasions; for example, meghli (rice pudding dessert, spiced with anise, caraway, and cinnamon) is served to celebrate a newborn baby in the family.Arak is an anise-flavoured moonshine, and is the Lebanese national drink, usually served with a traditional convivial Lebanese meal.
