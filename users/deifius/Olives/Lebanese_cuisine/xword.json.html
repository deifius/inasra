"content": "Lebanese cuisine (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0628\u062e \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646\u064a\u200e) is the culinary traditions and practices originating from Lebanon. It includes an abundance of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, fresh fish and seafood. Poultry is eaten more often than red meat, and when red meat is eaten, it is usually lamb and goat meat. It also includes copious amounts of garlic and olive oil, often seasoned with lemon juice. Chickpeas and parsley are also staples of the Lebanese diet.Well-known savoury dishes include baba ghanouj, a dip made of char-grilled eggplant; falafel, small deep-fried balls or patties made of highly spiced ground chickpeas, fava beans, or a combination of the two; and shawarma, a sandwich with marinated meat skewered and cooked on large rods. An important component of many Lebanese meals is hummus, a dip or spread made of blended chickpeas, tahini, lemon juice, and garlic, typically eaten with flatbread.A well-known dessert is baklava, which is made of layered filo (thinly rolled pastry) filled with nuts and steeped in date syrup or honey. Some desserts are specifically prepared on special occasions; for example, meghli (rice pudding dessert, spiced with anise, caraway, and cinnamon) is served to celebrate a newborn baby in the family.Arak is an anise-flavoured moonshine, and is the Lebanese national drink, usually served with a traditional convivial Lebanese meal. Another historic and traditional drink is Lebanese wine.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nLebanese cuisine has ancient roots and is part of the cuisine of the Levant. Many dishes in Lebanese cuisine can be traced back thousands of years to eras of Roman, Greek, Persian, Neo-Babylonian, Byzantine, Arab, Egyptian, and Phoenician rule.In the last 500 years, Lebanese cuisine has been influenced by the different foreign civilizations that held power. From 1516 to 1918, the Ottoman Turks controlled Lebanon and introduced a variety of foods that have become staples in the Lebanese diet, such as cooking with lamb. \nAfter the Ottomans were defeated in World War I (1914\u20131918), France took control of Lebanon until 1943, when the country achieved its independence. The French introduced foods such as flan, a caramel custard dessert dating back to the 16th century AD, eclairs, french fries and croissants.The Lebanese diaspora who live worldwide have introduced new ingredients, spices and culinary practices into Lebanese cuisine, keeping the cuisine innovative and renowned both beyond and within its borders.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nMost often, foods are grilled, baked or lightly cooked in olive oil; butter or cream is rarely used, other than in a few desserts. Vegetables are often eaten raw, pickled, or cooked. \nLike most Mediterranean countries, much of what the Lebanese eat is dictated by the seasons and what is available. Lebanese cuisine also varies by region. \n\nSouth Lebanon is famous for its kibbe, the Beqaa Valley for its meat pastries (such as sfiha), and north Lebanon and Saida (Sidon) for its sweets.In Lebanon, very rarely are drinks served without being accompanied by food. Similar to the tapas of Spain, mezeluri of Romania and aperitivo of Italy, mezze is an array of small dishes placed before the guests creating an array of colors, flavors, textures and aromas. This style of serving food is less a part of family life than it is of entertaining and caf\u00e9s. \nMezze may be as simple as raw or pickled vegetables, hummus, baba ghanouj and bread, or it may become an entire meal consisting of grilled marinated seafood, skewered meats and a variety of cooked and raw salads and an arrangement of desserts. The assortments of dishes forming the mezze are generally consumed in small bites using a piece of flatbread.A typical mezze will consist of an elaborate variety of 30 or so hot and cold dishes, which may include:\n\nSalads such as tabbouleh and fattoush\nDips like hummus, baba ghanoush and moutabal\nKebbeh, kafta and falafel (fried chickpea balls)\nSome patties such as the sambusac\nStuffed grape leaves and pickles\nRoasted nuts, olives and vegetables\nCondiments like toum and taratour, ideal for spread on sfihaWhen dining as a family, the mezze typically consists of three or four dishes, but when served in the restaurant, the mezze can range from 20 to 60 dishes, as the variant combinations and dishes involved are plenty.Family cuisine also offers a range of dishes, such as stews (yakhneh) which can be cooked in many forms depending on the ingredients used and are usually served with meat and rice.Although simple fresh fruits are often served towards the end of a Lebanese meal, there is also dessert, such as baklava and coffee.  When sweets are not available, fruits are typically eaten after meals, including figs, oranges and other citrus fruits, apples, grapes, cherries and green plums (janarek). Although baklava is the most internationally known dessert, there is a great variety of Lebanese desserts.\n\n\n== Dishes and ingredients ==\nLebanese dishes are heavily influenced by the multiple civilisations that have existed within the region, which has accumulated together to form the modern Lebanese cuisine we know today. Using fresh, flavourful ingredients and spices, Lebanese cuisine combines Turkish, Arab, and French cooking styles. Characteristics include the use of lamb (introduced by the Ottomans); the abundant use of nuts, especially almonds and pine nuts; and dressings made from lemon juice.\n\n\n=== Bread ===\nThe Lebanese use bread, usually flatbread, as an integral part of a meal and food is generally not served without it. Pita bread with a pocket, known as khubz Arabi (Arab bread), is widely popular, and may be cut or torn up to dip in various dishes, or be stuffed as a sandwich or wrap with ingredients such as falafel or shawarma. Taboon bread is traditionally baked in a taboon oven or a tannur, and is similar to the various tandoor breads found in many parts of Asia.Marquq is prepared much thinner, almost paper thin, and cooked on a metal saj or pan.Ka'ak is another common Lebanese street bread that is usually consumed as a snack. There are many variations of ka'ak, from being sprinkled with traditional sesame seeds to being stuffed with cheese and za'atar.Manaeesh (mini-pizza) traditionally garnished with cheese (kashk, in its Lebanese version), za'atar, spicy diced tomatoes and may be eaten for breakfast. These are made in many variants in a number of local bakeries or furns. Some bakeries allow customers to bring their own toppings in order to build their own customized manaeesh for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.Variants include manakousheh za'atar (thyme pizza) and manakousheh jebneh which has only cheese.Manaeesh dough can also be eaten with minced meat and onions which is called lahm bi 'ajin. Mini versions are called sfeeha. The same dough can be made into a triangular pie called fatayer, filled with spinach, onions and sumac.\n\n\n=== Dairy ===\nCheese, as well as yogurt and eggs, are commonly used in Lebanon. One of the more recognizable dishes within Lebanon is labneh. Unlike regular yogurt, labneh is strained so as to remove the watery whey, leaving a thicker, creamier consistency. It is spreadable and garnished with olive oil and sea salt. It is an extremely versatile dish that can be served in a mezze platter for either breakfast or dinner.  A variant is mixed with garlic.Ejjeh is the traditional omelette of Lebanon. It is made with egg, chopped parsley and scallions. Within Lebanon, people make this omelette with different herbs that are cultivated from their village.\n\n\n==== Cheeses ====\nAckawi (also akkawi), is a salty white cheese made from pasteurized cow's milk but can also be made with goat's or sheep's milk.\nBaladi cheese has a mild yet rich flavor. It is called the \"cheese of the mountains\" since it is made in the high mountains by local shepherds in Lebanon.\nFeta is used in salads and other dishes, although some cooks will use a milder cheese called jibtieh baidha (simply \"white cheese\").\nHalloum is a semi-hard unripened cheese, perfect for grilling and frying. Along with akkawi, it is traditionally stored in brine, giving it a strong, salty taste, though modern methods have allowed fresher varieties with less salt.\nKashkaval is a cheese popular in many Eastern European countries that has made its way into Lebanese cuisine. It melts very quickly and is practical for pasta, pizza and sandwiches.\nNabulsi is similar to halloumi, made by boiling fresh ackawi cheese in a mixture of spices and seeds which are then fried, grilled or eaten and used in the popular dessert knafeh, a cheese pastry soaked in a sugar-based syrup.\nShanklish is made from cow's milk, salted, fermented and seasoned with thyme and pepper and formed into cheese balls, coated in red pepper chilli flakes.\n\n\n=== Stews ===\nLebanese stews, often served with rice or flatbread, are made with ingredients found locally available. \n\nOkra and tomato stew ( \u0628\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0632\u064a\u062a, bamieh bi-zeit) is one of the most popular. Traditionally, it is served with rice and a basic salad dressed with lemon juice and olive oil, with fresh warm bread. This stew combines the distinct flavor of okra with a flavourful tomato sauce. An alternative version, bamya bel lahmeh, adds small pieces of filleted lamb or beef that have been saut\u00e9ed beforehand to avoid a boiled taste.\nBean stews are common where various beans are grown. An example of a mixed bean Lebanese stew is makhlouta made of a variety of beans, wheat, and legumes, popular in the town of Baskinta. Others include fava bean stew, kidney bean stew (fasoulya hamanieh) and another kidney and lentil stew called mjadrat fasoulya popular in Rashaya. Taro and lentil stew (abu shoushe) and spinach stew (yakhnet sabanikh) are a few of the others available.Mulukhiyah is a stew with mallow leaves, chicken, beef, and in the Lebanese fashion, topped with raw chopped onions, and vinegar. In northern Lebanon, one like mulukhiyah is called mloukhiye b'zeit, made using fresh leaves and shoots of the Nalta jute plant, cooked with olive oil, onions, garlic, tomatoes and chilli peppers, a popular summer side dish, especially in Miniyeh-Danniyeh and Akkar districts.In summer one of the easiest and simplest ways to make use of the abundant summer zucchini is mfaraket koussa (spicy zucchini stew). Daoud bacha, another meat-based stew, consists of beef meatballs (also lamb) with cinnamon, parsley, and stuffed with pinenuts in a tomato sauce.\n\n\n=== Vegetarian ===\nVegetarian cuisine plays an important role in the cuisine of Lebanon. Being located in the Levant, vegetables and herbs (wild or cultivated) are abundant in the fertile landscape and serve as a main base of the cuisine. Some of the most popular street foods in Lebanon are vegetarian including fava beans, hot roasted peanuts served in a paper cone, prickly pears (served peeled and on ice), ful medames (fava beans) and balila (chickpeas seasoned with cumin).Nearly everything can be cooked either with meat or b\u2019zeit (oil), from beans to fish, stews and spinach. Meat was traditionally precious and usually served on a Sunday, but was expensive and usually eaten with bulgur or rice to prolong the shelf life. \n\nFor Lebanese Christians, including Catholic (Maronites and Melkites) and Orthodox, fasting from meat is practiced over the Lenten period (from midnight to noon) during Easter.

Prunus amygdalus) is a species of tree native to Iran and surrounding countries but widely cultivated elsewhere. The almond is also the name of the edible and widely cultivated seed of this tree. Within the genus Prunus, it is classified with the peach in the subgenus Amygdalus, distinguished from the other subgenera by corrugations on the shell (endocarp) surrounding the seed.The fruit of the almond is a drupe, consisting of an outer hull and a hard shell with the seed, which is not a true nut, inside. Shelling almonds refers to removing the shell to reveal the seed. Almonds are sold shelled or unshelled. Blanched almonds are shelled almonds that have been treated with hot water to soften the seedcoat, which is then removed to reveal the white embryo.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Tree ===\nThe almond is a deciduous tree, growing 4\u201310 m (13\u201333 ft) in height, with a trunk of up to 30 cm (12 in) in diameter. The young twigs are green at first, becoming purplish where exposed to sunlight, then grey in their second year. The leaves are 8\u201313 cm (3\u20135 in) long, with a serrated margin and a 2.5 cm (1 in) petiole. The flowers are white to pale pink, 3\u20135 cm (1\u20132 in) diameter with five petals, produced singly or in pairs and appearing before the leaves in early spring. Almond grows best in Mediterranean climates with warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The optimal temperature for their growth is between 15 and 30 \u00b0C (59 and 86 \u00b0F) and the tree buds have a chilling requirement of 200 to 700 hours below 7.2 \u00b0C (45.0 \u00b0F) to break dormancy.Almonds begin bearing an economic crop in the third year after planting. Trees reach full bearing five to six years after planting. The fruit matures in the autumn, 7\u20138 months after flowering.\n\n\n=== Drupe ===\n\nThe almond fruit is 3.5\u20136 cm (1+3\u20448\u20132+3\u20448 in) long. In botanical terms, it is not a nut but a drupe. The outer covering or exocarp, fleshy in other members of Prunus such as the plum and cherry, is instead a thick, leathery, grey-green coat (with a downy exterior), called the hull. Inside the hull is a reticulated, hard, woody shell (like the outside of a peach pit) called the endocarp. Inside the shell is the edible seed, commonly called a nut. Generally, one seed is present, but occasionally two occur. After the fruit matures, the hull splits and separates from the shell, and an abscission layer forms between the stem and the fruit so that the fruit can fall from the tree.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Origin and history ==\n\nThe almond is native to Iran and surrounding countries. It was spread by humans in ancient times along the shores of the Mediterranean into northern Africa and southern Europe, and more recently transported to other parts of the world, notably California, United States. The wild form of domesticated almond grows in parts of the Levant.Selection of the sweet type from the many bitter types in the wild marked the beginning of almond domestication. It is unclear as to which wild ancestor of the almond created the domesticated species. The species Prunus fenzliana may be the most likely wild ancestor of the almond, in part because it is native to Armenia and western Azerbaijan, where it was apparently domesticated. Wild almond species were grown by early farmers, \"at first unintentionally in the garbage heaps, and later intentionally in their orchards\".Almonds were one of the earliest domesticated fruit trees, due to \"the ability of the grower to raise attractive almonds from seed. Thus, in spite of the fact that this plant does not lend itself to propagation from suckers or from cuttings, it could have been domesticated even before the introduction of grafting\". Domesticated almonds appear in the Early Bronze Age (3000\u20132000 BC), such as the archaeological sites of Numeira (Jordan), or possibly earlier. Another well-known archaeological example of the almond is the fruit found in Tutankhamun's tomb in Egypt (c. 1325 BC), probably imported from the Levant. An article on Almond tree cultivation in Spain is brought down in Ibn al-'Awwam's 12th-century agricultural work, Book on Agriculture.Of the European countries that the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh reported as cultivating almonds, Germany is the northernmost, though the domesticated form can be found as far north as Iceland.\n\n\n=== Etymology and names ===\nThe word \"almond\" comes from Old French almande or alemande, Late Latin *amandula, derived from amygdala from the Ancient Greek \u1f00\u03bc\u03c5\u03b3\u03b4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 (amygd\u00e1l\u0113) (cf. amygdala, an almond-shaped portion of the brain). The al- in English, for the a- used in other languages may be due a confusion with the Arabic article al, the word having first dropped the a- as in the Italian form mandorla; the British pronunciation ah-mond and the modern Catalan ametlla and modern French amande show a form of the word closer to the original. Other related names of almond include Mandel or Knackmandel (German), mandorlo (Italian for the tree), mandorla (Italian for the fruit), am\u00eandoa (Portuguese), and almendro (Spanish for the tree), almendra (Spanish for the fruit). Interestingly however, in Hebrew, the word for almond (\u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05e7\u05b5\u05d3, pronounced shak-ed) is also the word for tonsil.\nThe adjective \"amygdaloid\" (literally \"like an almond\") is used to describe objects which are roughly almond-shaped, particularly a shape which is part way between a triangle and an ellipse. See, for example, the brain structure amygdala, which uses a direct borrowing of the Greek term amygdal\u0113.\n\n\n== Cultivation ==\n\n\n=== Pollination ===\nThe pollination of California's almonds is the largest annual managed pollination event in the world, with 1.4 million hives (nearly half of all beehives in the US) being trucked in February to the almond orchards. Much of the pollination is managed by pollination brokers, who contract with migratory beekeepers from at least 49 states for the event. This business has been heavily affected by colony collapse disorder, causing nationwide shortages of honey bees and increasing the price of insect pollination. To partially protect almond growers from the rising cost of insect pollination, researchers at the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) have developed a new line of self-pollinating almond trees. Self-pollinating almond trees, such as the 'Tuono', have been around for a while, but their harvest is not as desirable as the insect-pollinated California 'Nonpareil' almond tree. The 'Nonpareil' tree produces large, smooth almonds and offers 60\u201365% edible kernel per nut. The Tuono has thicker, hairier shells and offers only 32% of edible kernel per nut, but having a thick shell has advantages. The Tuono's shell protects the nut from threatening pests such as the navel orangeworm. ARS researchers have managed to crossbreed the pest-resistant Tuono tree with the Nonpareil, resulting in hybridized cultivars of almond trees that are self-pollinated and maintain a high nut quality. The new, self-pollinating hybrids possess quality skin color, flavor, and oil content, and reduce almond growers' dependency on insect pollination.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Diseases ===\n\nAlmond trees can be attacked by an array of damaging organisms, including insects, fungal pathogens, plant viruses, and bacteria.\n\n\n== Sustainability ==\nAlmond production in California is concentrated mainly in the Central Valley, where the mild climate, rich soil, abundant sunshine and water supply make for ideal growing conditions. Due to the persistent droughts in California in the early 21st century, it became more difficult to raise almonds in a sustainable manner. The issue is complex because of the high amount of water needed to produce almonds: a single almond requires roughly 1.1 US gallons (0.92 imperial gallons; 4.2 litres) of water to grow properly.\n\nSustainability strategies implemented by the Almond Board of California and almond farmers include:\ntree and soil health, and other farming practices\nminimizing dust production during the harvest\nbee health\nirrigation guidelines for farmers\nfood safety\nuse of waste biomass as coproducts with a goal to achieve zero waste\nuse of solar energy during processing\njob development\nsupport of scientific research to investigate potential health benefits of consuming almonds\ninternational education about sustainability practices\n\n\n== Production ==\nIn 2018, world production of almonds grew by 45% over the 2017 volume to 3.2 million tonnes, with the United States providing 59% of the world total. As other leading producers, Spain, Iran, and Morocco combined contributed 18% of the world total (table).\n\n\n=== United States ===\nIn the United States, production is concentrated in California where 1,000,000 acres (400,000 ha) and six different almond varieties were under cultivation in 2017, with a yield of 2.25 billion lb (1.02 billion kg) of shelled almonds. California production is marked by a period of intense pollination during late winter by rented commercial bees transported by truck across the United States to almond groves, requiring more than half of the total US honeybee population. The value of total US exports of shelled almonds in 2016 was $3.2 billion.\n\n\n=== Spain ===\nSpain has diverse commercial cultivars of almonds grown in Catalonia, Valencia, Murcia, Andalusia, and Arag\u00f3n regions, and the Balearic Islands. Production in 2016 declined 2% nationally compared to 2015 production data.The 'Marcona' almond cultivar is recognizably different from other almonds and is marketed by name. The kernel is short, round, relatively sweet, and delicate in texture. Its origin is unknown and has been grown in Spain for a long time; the tree is very productive, and the shell of the nut is very hard.\n\n\n=== Australia ===\nAustralia is the largest almond production region in the Southern Hemisphere. Most of the almond orchards are located along the Murray River corridor in New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.\n\n\n== Sweet and bitter almonds ==\n\nThe seeds of Prunus dulcis var. dulcis are predominantly sweet but some individual trees produce seeds that are somewhat more bitter. The genetic basis for bitterness involves a single gene, the bitter flavor furthermore being recessive, both aspects making this trait easier to domesticate. The fruits from Prunus dulcis var. amara are always bitter, as are the kernels from other species of genus Prunus, such as apricot, peach and cherry (although to a lesser extent).\n\n\n=== Amygdalin and cyanide ===\nThe bitter almond is slightly broader and shorter than the sweet almond and contains about 50% of the fixed oil that occurs in sweet almonds. It also contains the enzyme emulsin which, in the presence of water, acts on the two soluble glucosides amygdalin and prunasin yielding glucose, cyanide and the essential oil of bitter almonds, which is nearly pure benzaldehyde, the chemical causing the bitter flavor. Bitter almonds may yield 4\u20139 mg of hydrogen cyanide per almond and contain 42 times higher amounts of cyanide than the trace levels found in sweet almonds. The origin of cyanide content in bitter almonds is via the enzymatic hydrolysis of amygdalin. P450 monooxygenases are involved in the amygdalin biosynthetic pathway. A point mutation in a bHLH transcription factor prevents transcription of the two cytochrome P450 genes, resulting in the sweet kernel trait.Extract of bitter almond was once used medicinally but even in small doses, effects are severe or lethal, especially in children; the cyanide must be removed before consumption. The acute oral lethal dose of cyanide for adult humans is reported to be 0.5\u20133.5 mg/kg (0.2\u20131.6 mg/lb) of body weight (approximately 50 bitter almonds), whereas for children, consuming 5\u201310 bitter almonds may be fatal.All commercially grown almonds sold as food in the United States are sweet cultivars. The US Food and Drug Administration reported in 2010 that some fractions of imported sweet almonds were contaminated with bitter almonds. Eating such almonds could result in vertigo and other typical bitter almond (cyanide) poisoning effects.\n\n\n== Culinary uses ==\n\nWhile the almond is often eaten on its own, raw or toasted, it is also a component of various dishes. Almonds are available in many forms, such as whole, slivered, and ground into flour. Almond pieces around 2\u20133 mm in size, called \"nibs\", are used for special purposes such as decoration.Almonds are a common addition to breakfast muesli or oatmeal.\n\n\n=== Use in desserts ===\n\nA wide range of classic sweets feature almonds as a central ingredient. Since the 19th century almonds have been used to make bread, almond butter, cakes and puddings, candied confections, almond cream-filled pastries, nougat,  cookies (macaroons, biscotti and qurabiya), and cakes (financiers, Esterh\u00e1zy torte), and other sweets and desserts.The young, developing fruit of the almond tree can be eaten whole (green almonds) when they are still green and fleshy on the outside and the inner shell has not yet hardened. The fruit is somewhat sour, but is a popular snack in parts of the Middle East, eaten dipped in salt to balance the sour taste. Also in the Middle East they are often eaten with dates. They are available only from mid-April to mid-June in the Northern Hemisphere; pickling or brining extends the fruit's shelf life.\n\n\n=== World cuisines ===\nIn French cuisine, alternating layers of almond and hazelnut meringue are used to make the dessert dacquoise. Pithivier is one of many almond cream-filled pastries.\nIn Germany, Easter bread called Deutsches Osterbrot is baked with raisins and almonds.\nIn Greece almond flour is used to make amygdalopita, a glyka tapsiou dessert cake baking in a tray. Almonds are used for kourabiedes, a Greek version of the traditional quarabiya almond biscuits. A soft drink known as soumada is made from almonds in various regions.\nIn Saudi Arabia, almonds are a typical embellishment for the rice dish kabsa.\nIn Iran, green almonds are dipped in sea salt and eaten as snacks on street markets; they are called chaqale b\u00e2dam. Candied almonds called noghl are served alongside tea and coffee. Also, sweet almonds are used to prepare special food for babies, named harire badam. Almonds are added to some foods, cookies, and desserts, or are used to decorate foods. People in Iran consume roasted nuts for special events, for example, during New Year (Nowruz) parties.\nIn Italy, colomba di Pasqua is a traditional Easter cake made with almonds. Bitter almonds are the base for amaretticookies. a common dessert. Almonds are also a common choice as the nuts to include in torrone.\nIn Morocco, almonds in the form of sweet almond paste are the main ingredient in pastry fillings, and several other desserts. Fried blanched whole almonds are also used to decorate sweet tajines such as lamb with prunes. Southwestern Berber regions of Essaouira and Souss are also known for amlou, a spread made of almond paste, argan oil, and honey. Almond paste is also mixed with toasted flour and among others, honey, olive oil or butter, anise, fennel, sesame seeds, and cinnamon to make sellou (also called zamita in Meknes or slilou in Marrakech), a sweet snack known for its long shelf life and high nutritive value.\nIn Indian cuisine, almonds are the base ingredients of pasanda-style and Mughlai curries. Badam halva is a sweet made from almonds with added coloring. Almond flakes are added to many sweets (such as sohan barfi), and are usually visible sticking to the outer surface. Almonds form the base of various drinks which are supposed to have cooling properties. Almond sherbet or sherbet-e-badaam, is a popular summer drink. Almonds are also sold as a snack with added salt.\nIn Israel almonds are used as a topping for tahini cookies or eaten as a snack.\nIn Spain Marcona almonds are usually toasted in oil and lightly salted. They are used by Spanish confectioners to prepare a sweet called turr\u00f3n.\nIn Arabian cuisine, almonds are commonly used as garnishing for Mansaf.Certain natural food stores sell \"bitter almonds\" or \"apricot kernels\" labeled as such, requiring significant caution by consumers for how to prepare and eat these products.\n\n\n=== Marzipan ===\n\nMarzipan is used in a number of elegant cakes and desserts. Princess cake is covered by marzipan (similar to fondant), as is Battenberg cake. In Sicily, sponge cake is covered with marzipan to make cassatella di sant'Agata and cassata siciliana, and marzipan is dyed and crafted into realistic fruit shaped to make frutta martorana. The Andalusian Christmas pastry pan de C\u00e1diz is filled with marzipan and candied fruit.\n\n\n=== Almond milk ===\n\nAlmonds can be processed into a milk substitute called almond milk; the nut's soft texture, mild flavor, and light coloring (when skinned) make for an efficient analog to dairy, and a soy-free choice for lactose intolerant people and vegans. Raw, blanched, and lightly toasted almonds work well for different production techniques, some of which are similar to that of soymilk and some of which use no heat, resulting in \"raw milk\" (see raw foodism).\nAlmond milk, along with almond butter and almond oil, are a versatile products used in both sweet and savoury dishes.\nIn Moroccan cuisine, sharbat billooz is one of the best known beverages, served for weddings, it is made by blending blanched almonds with milk, sugar and other flavorings.\n\n\n=== Almond flour and skins ===\nAlmond flour or ground almond meal combined with sugar or honey as marzipan is often used as a gluten-free alternative to wheat flour in cooking and baking.Almonds contain polyphenols in their skins consisting of flavonols, flavan-3-ols, hydroxybenzoic acids and flavanones analogous to those of certain fruits and vegetables. These phenolic compounds and almond skin prebiotic dietary fiber have commercial interest as food additives or dietary supplements.\n\n\n=== Almond syrup ===\nHistorically, almond syrup was an emulsion of sweet and bitter almonds, usually made with barley syrup (orgeat syrup) or in a syrup of orange flower water and sugar, often flavored with a synthetic aroma of almonds. Orgeat syrup is an important ingredient in the Mai Tai and many other Tiki drinks.Due to the cyanide found in bitter almonds, modern syrups generally are produced only from sweet almonds. Such syrup products do not contain significant levels of hydrocyanic acid, so are generally considered safe for human consumption.\n\n\n== Nutrition ==\nAlmonds are 4% water, 22% carbohydrates, 21% protein, and 50% fat (table). In a 100-gram (3+1\u20442-ounce) reference amount, almonds supply 2,420 kilojoules (579 kilocalories) of food energy. The almond is a nutritionally dense food (table), providing a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of the B vitamins riboflavin and niacin, vitamin E, and the essential minerals calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, and zinc. Almonds are a moderate source (10\u201319% DV) of the B vitamins thiamine, vitamin B6, and folate, choline, and the essential mineral potassium. They also contain substantial dietary fiber, the monounsaturated fat, oleic acid, and the polyunsaturated fat, linoleic acid. Typical of nuts and seeds, almonds are a source of phytosterols such as beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, campesterol, sitostanol, and campestanol.\n\n\n=== Health ===\nAlmonds are included as a good source of protein among recommended healthy foods by the US Department of Agriculture. A 2016 review of clinical research indicated that regular consumption of almonds may reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering blood levels of LDL cholesterol.\n\n\n=== Potential allergy ===\nAlmonds may cause allergy or intolerance. Cross-reactivity is common with peach allergens (lipid transfer proteins) and tree nut allergens. Symptoms range from local signs and symptoms (e.g., oral allergy syndrome, contact urticaria) to systemic signs and symptoms including anaphylaxis (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms).\n\n\n== Oils ==\n\nAlmonds are a rich source of oil, with 50% of kernel dry mass as fat (whole almond nutrition table). In relation to total dry mass of the kernel, almond oil contains 32% monounsaturated oleic acid (an omega-9 fatty acid), 13% linoleic acid (a polyunsaturated omega-6 essential fatty acid), and 10% saturated fatty acid (mainly as palmitic acid, USDA link in table). Linolenic acid, a polyunsaturated omega-3 fat, is not present (table). Almond oil is a rich source of vitamin E, providing 261% of the Daily Value per 100 ml (table).\nWhen almond oil is analyzed separately and expressed per 100 grams as a reference mass, the oil provides 3,700 kJ (884 kcal) of food energy, 8 grams of saturated fat (81% of which is palmitic acid), 70 grams of oleic acid, and 17 grams of linoleic acid (oil table).\nOleum amygdalae, the fixed oil, is prepared from either sweet or bitter almonds, and is a glyceryl oleate with a slight odour and a nutty taste. It is almost insoluble in alcohol but readily soluble in chloroform or ether. Almond oil is obtained from the dried kernel of almonds.\n\n\n== Aflatoxins ==\nAlmonds are susceptible to aflatoxin-producing molds. Aflatoxins are potent carcinogenic chemicals produced by molds such as Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. The mold contamination may occur from soil, previously infested almonds, and almond pests such as navel-orange worm. High levels of mold growth typically appear as gray to black filament like growth. It is unsafe to eat mold-infected tree nuts.\nSome countries have strict limits on allowable levels of aflatoxin contamination of almonds and require adequate testing before the nuts can be marketed to their citizens. The European Union, for example, introduced a requirement since 2007 that all almond shipments to EU be tested for aflatoxin. If aflatoxin does not meet the strict safety regulations, the entire consignment may be reprocessed to eliminate the aflatoxin or it must be destroyed.\n\n\n== Mandatory pasteurization in California ==\nThe USDA approved a proposal by the Almond Board of California to pasteurize almonds sold to the public, after tracing cases of salmonellosis to almonds. The almond pasteurization program became mandatory for California companies in 2007. Raw, untreated California almonds have not been available in the U.S. since then.\nCalifornia almonds labeled \"raw\" must be steam-pasteurized or chemically treated with propylene oxide (PPO). This does not apply to imported almonds or almonds sold from the grower directly to the consumer in small quantities. The treatment also is not required for raw almonds sold for export outside of North America.\nThe Almond Board of California states: \"PPO residue dissipates after treatment\". The U.S. EPA has reported: \"Propylene oxide has been detected in fumigated food products; consumption of contaminated food is another possible route of exposure\". PPO is classified as Group 2B (\"possibly carcinogenic to humans\").The USDA-approved marketing order was challenged in court by organic farmers organized by the Cornucopia Institute, a Wisconsin-based farm policy research group. According to the Cornucopia Institute, this almond marketing order has imposed significant financial burdens on small-scale and organic growers and damaged domestic almond markets. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in the spring of 2009 on procedural grounds. In August 2010, a federal appeals court ruled that the farmers have a right to appeal the USDA regulation. In March 2013, the court vacated the suit on the basis that the objections should have been raised in 2007 when the regulation was first proposed.\n\n\n== Cultural aspects ==\nThe almond is highly revered in some cultures. The tree originated in the Middle East, and is mentioned numerous times in the Bible.\nIn the Hebrew Bible, the almond was a symbol of watchfulness and promise due to its early flowering. In the Bible the almond is mentioned ten times, beginning with Book of Genesis 43:11, where it is described as \"among the best of fruits\". In Numbers 17 Levi is chosen from the other tribes of Israel by Aaron's rod, which brought forth almond flowers. According to tradition, the rod of Aaron bore sweet almonds on one side and bitter on the other; if the Israelites followed the Lord, the sweet almonds would be ripe and edible, but if they were to forsake the path of the Lord, the bitter almonds would predominate. The almond blossom supplied a model for the menorah which stood in the Holy Temple, \"Three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, were on one branch, with a knob and a flower; and three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, were on the other...on the candlestick itself were four cups, shaped like almond blossoms, with its knobs and flowers\"  (Exodus 25:33\u201334; 37:19\u201320). Many Sephardic Jews give 5 almonds to each guest before special occasions like weddings.Similarly, Christian symbolism often uses almond branches as a symbol of the Virgin Birth of Jesus; paintings and icons often include almond-shaped haloes encircling the Christ Child and as a symbol of Mary. The word \"Luz\", which appears in Genesis 30:37, sometimes translated as \"hazel\", may actually be derived from the Aramaic name for almond (Luz), and is translated as such in some Bible versions such as the NIV. The Arabic name for almond is \u0644\u0648\u0632 \"lauz\" or \"l\u016bz\". In some parts of the Levant and North Africa it is pronounced \"loz\", which is very close to its Aramaic origin.\nLa entrada de la flor is an event celebrated on 1 February in Torrent, Spain, in which the clavarios and members of the Confrerie of the Mother of God deliver a branch of the first-blooming almond-tree to the Virgin.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFruit tree forms\nFruit tree propagation\nFruit tree pruning\nList of almond dishes\nList of edible seeds\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUniversity of California Fruit and Nut Research and Information Center", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/AlmondShakerbeforeafter.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Almond_blossom02_aug_2007.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Almond_shell.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Almond_tree_in_blossom_%28Israel%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Almond_with_two_kernels.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Almonds_-_in_shell%2C_shell_cracked_open%2C_shelled%2C_blanched.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Almondtrees.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Ametllesjuliol.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Baburnama_illustration.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Blanched_almonds.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Colomba_pasquale%2C_edizione_2013_-_ND0_4662_%288564331585%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Flag_of_Australia_%28converted%29.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Flag_of_Iran.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Flag_of_Morocco.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Flag_of_Turkey.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Flickr_-_cyclonebill_-_G%C3%A5sebryst.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Green_almonds.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Guinda-Almendras-Nata.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Kulturmandel_unreife_Fr%C3%BCchte.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Madrigueras_%2820578932389%29_%28cropped%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Mandorle_sgusciate.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Prunus_dulcis_-_K%C3%B6hler%E2%80%93s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-250.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Rose_ringed_Parakeet_in_bitter_Almond.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/SweetAlmondOil.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%85_%D9%88_%D8%B4%DA%A9%D9%88%D9%81%D9%87_%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%85.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/03/Flag_of_Italy.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9a/Flag_of_Spain.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg"], "summary": "The almond (Prunus dulcis, syn.

There are two types of marula oil, the oil extracted from the seeds and the oil extracted from the nut's hard shell. Marula oil is traditionally used in cosmetics, in food as a cooking oil, and as a meat preservative and to treat leather.\n\n\n== Chemical composition ==\nMarula oil contains a large proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids which make the oil very stable. The fatty acid composition of marula oil includes:Monounsaturated fatty acids:\n\nOleic acid (70\u201378%)Polyunsaturated fatty acids:\n\nLinoleic acid (4.0\u20137.0%)\nAlpha-linolenic acid (0.1\u20130.7%)Saturated fatty acids:\n\nPalmitic acid (9\u201312%)\nStearic acid (5.0\u20138.0%)\nArachidonic acid (0.3\u20130.7%)Tocopherols, sterols, flavonoids, procyanidin, gallotannin and catechins are also found in marula oil.\n\n\n== Physical properties ==\nMarula oil has a clear, light yellow colour and a nutty aroma. It has a saponification value of approximately 188\u2013199 and a specific gravity of 0.91\u20130.92 (at 15 \u00b0C).\n\n\n== Traditional uses ==\nThe Tsonga people of South Africa and Mozambique have used the oil as a moisturising body lotion for women and also as a massage oil for babies. In the past, Namibian women used marula oil rather than water to clean themselves.Marula oil is used in diets, especially for people of the Inhambane Province in Mozambique, Owambo in north central Namibia, Northern KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa and the Zvishavane district of Zimbabwe.  Furthermore, marula plays an important role in the diet of Bushmen and Bantus. The Venda use the oil from the kernels to preserve meat, which enables it to last up to a year. Marula oil is considered a delicacy by local people, and is added to many traditional and modern recipes.\n\n\n== References ==", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Marula_Oil.jpg"], "summary": "Marula oil is extracted from the kernels (nuts) of the fruits of the Marula trees (Sclerocarya birrea), from the family Anacardiaceae.

In Korea, the word samgyeop-sal, meaning \"pork belly\", often refers to samgyeop-sal-gui (grilled pork belly), in the same way that the word galbi, meaning \"ribs\", often refers to galbi-gui (grilled beef ribs). Gui refers to roasted, baked, or grilled dishes.\nOne can also find ogyeopsal (\uc624\uacb9\uc0b4), with an o meaning \"five\". Ogyeop-sal includes the skin part of the pork belly, unlike samgyeop-sal where the skin is removed. This corresponds with the Chinese word for pork belly, w\u01d4 hu\u0101 r\u00f2u (\u4e94\u82b1\u8089) or \"five flower meat\", as the Chinese pork belly usually includes the rind.\n\n\n== Preparation ==\n\nThick, fatty slices of pork belly, sometimes with the skin left on and sometimes scored on the diagonal, are grilled on a slanted metal griddle or a gridiron at the diners' table, inset with charcoal grills or convex gas burners. Usually, diners grill the meat themselves, flipping and cutting them with tongs and scissors, and eat directly from the grill.The meat is usually neither marinated nor seasoned, although marinated samgyeopsal in flavors such as ginseng, wine, garlic, herbs, curry, doenjang, and gochujang has gained popularity since the late 2000s. Slices of garlic, onions, green chili peppers, mushrooms, and kimchi are often grilled alongside using the fat trickling from the pork belly.Common accompaniments for samgyeopsal include ssam vegetables such as lettuce, kkaennip (perilla leaves), ssammu (pickled radish paper) and dipping sauces such as ssamjang (made with seasoned mixture of chili paste and soy bean paste) and gireum-jang (made with sesame oil, salt, and black pepper), jangajji (soy sauce-pickled vegetables) such as myeongi-jangajji (pickled Siberian onion leaves) or yangpa-jangajji (pickled onions), kimchi, as well as sliced garlic, onions, and seasoned shredded scallions. Garlic, onions, and kimchi can be either grilled with the meat or consumed raw with the cooked meat. Mushrooms, such as button mushrooms or oyster mushrooms, are also grilled with the meat.\n\n\n== Consumption ==\nGrilled meat is placed on fresh and/or pickled leaves of vegetables, with some ssamjang, and rolled up to make ssam (wrap) which is eaten in one mouthful. Any combination of accompaniments mentioned above can be added to the roll according to preference, most popularly sliced garlic.Cooked rice, stews such as kimchi-jjigae and doenjang-jjigae, as well as naengmyeon (cold noodles), can be served as meals. Sometimes, leftover meat is mixed with rice, gim-garu (seaweed flakes), and seasonings to make bokkeum-bap (fried rice) at the end.\nSamgyeopsal is often accompanied by, or accompanying (as anju) shots of soju. Somaek, a simple cocktail made by dumping a shot of soju into a glass of beer, is also a popular beverage consumed with samgyeopasal.\n\n\n== Popularity ==\n\nIn South Korea, the third day of March is \"Samgyeopsal Day\", due to samgyeopsal's three-layered composition.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBacon \u2013 A type of salt-cured pork\nKorean barbecue \u2013 style of food preparation in Korean cuisine\nList of pork dishes \u2013 Wikipedia list article\n\n\n== References ==", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Bacon_%281%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Foodlogo2.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Korean_barbeque-Samgyeopsal-05.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Samgyeopsal-gui.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Samgyeopsal_%28pork_belly%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg"], "summary": "Samgyeopsal (\uc0bc\uacb9\uc0b4, \u4e09--, lit.\u2009'three-layer meat'), samgyeopsal-gui (\uc0bc\uacb9\uc0b4\uad6c\uc774), or grilled pork belly is a type of gui (grilled dish) in Korean cuisine."}}, "#render": {"_": "<html hidden><meta charset=utf-8></html><script src=/render.js></script></html>", "css": "/styles.css"}}
