The species is cultivated in all the countries of the Mediterranean, as well as South America, South Africa, China, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, and the United States. Olea europaea is the type species for the genus Olea.\nThe olive's fruit, also called an \"olive\", is of major agricultural importance in the Mediterranean region as the source of olive oil; it is one of the core ingredients in Mediterranean cuisine. The tree and its fruit give their name to the plant family, which also includes species such as lilacs, jasmine, Forsythia, and the true ash trees (Fraxinus).\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word olive derives from Latin \u014fl\u012bva (\"olive fruit\", \"olive tree\"), possibly through Etruscan \ud800\udf00\ud800\udf05\ud800\udf09\ud800\udf04\ud800\udf0b\ud800\udf04 (eleiva) from the archaic Proto-Greek form *\u1f10\u03bb\u03b1\u03af\u03dd\u03b1 (*ela\u00edwa) (Classic Greek \u1f10\u03bb\u03b1\u03af\u03b1 ela\u00eda, \"olive fruit\", \"olive tree\").The word oil originally meant \"olive oil\", from \u014fl\u0115um, \u1f14\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (\u00e9laion, \"olive oil\"). Also in multiple other languages the word for \"oil\" ultimately derives from the name of this tree and its fruit.\nThe oldest attested forms of the Greek words are the Mycenaean \ud800\udc01\ud800\udc28\ud800\udc37, e-ra-wa, and \ud800\udc01\ud800\udc28\ud800\udc3a, e-ra-wo or \ud800\udc01\ud800\udc49\ud800\udc3a, e-rai-wo, written in the Linear B syllabic script.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe olive tree, Olea europaea, is an evergreen tree or shrub native to Mediterranean Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is short and squat, and rarely exceeds 8\u201315 m (26\u201349 ft) in height.  'Pisciottana', a unique variety comprising 40,000 trees found only in the area around Pisciotta in the Campania region of southern Italy, often exceeds this, with correspondingly large trunk diameters. The silvery green leaves are oblong, measuring 4\u201310 cm (1.6\u20133.9 in) long and 1\u20133 cm (0.39\u20131.18 in) wide. The trunk is typically gnarled and twisted.The small, white, feathery flowers, with ten-cleft calyx and corolla, two stamens, and bifid stigma, are borne generally on the previous year's wood, in racemes springing from the axils of the leaves.\nThe fruit is a small drupe 1\u20132.5 cm (0.39\u20130.98 in) long when ripe, thinner-fleshed and smaller in wild plants than in orchard cultivars. Olives are harvested in the green to purple stage. Canned black olives have often been artificially blackened (see below on processing) and may contain the chemical ferrous gluconate to improve the appearance. Olea europaea contains a seed commonly referred to in American English as a \"pit\", and in British English as a \"stone\".\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe six natural subspecies of Olea europaea are distributed over a wide range:\nOlea europaea subsp. europaea (Mediterranean Basin)\nOlea europaea var. sylvestris, considered the \"wild\" olive of the Mediterranean, is a variety characterized by a smaller tree bearing noticeably smaller fruit.\nO. e. subsp. cuspidata (from South Africa throughout East Africa, Arabia to Southwest China)\nO. e. subsp. cerasiformis (Madeira); also known as Olea maderensis\nO. e. subsp. guanchica (Canary Islands)\nO. e. subsp. laperrinei (Algeria, Sudan, Niger)\nO. e. subsp. maroccana (Morocco)The subspecies O. e. cerasiformis is tetraploid, and O. e. maroccana is hexaploid.Wild-growing forms of the olive are sometimes treated as the species Olea oleaster.\nThe trees referred to as \"white\" and \"black\" olives in Southeast Asia are not actually olives, but species of Canarium.\n\n\n=== Cultivars ===\n\nHundreds of cultivars of the olive tree are known. An olive's cultivar has a significant impact on its colour, size, shape, and growth characteristics, as well as the qualities of olive oil. Olive cultivars may be used primarily for oil, eating, or both. Olives cultivated for consumption are generally referred to as \"table olives\".Since many olive cultivars are self-sterile or nearly so, they are generally planted in pairs with a single primary cultivar and a secondary cultivar selected for its ability to fertilize the primary one. In recent times, efforts have been directed at producing hybrid cultivars with qualities useful to farmers, such as resistance to disease, quick growth, and larger or more consistent crops.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Prehistory ===\nFossil evidence indicates the olive tree had its origins 20\u201340 million years ago in the Oligocene, in what is now corresponding to Italy and the eastern Mediterranean Basin.\nWild oleasters were present and collected in the East Mediterranean since ~19,000 BP. The genome of cultivated olives reflects their origin from oleaster populations in the East Mediterranean.\nThe olive plant was first cultivated some 7,000 years ago in Mediterranean regions.The edible olive seems to have coexisted with humans for about 5,000 to 6,000 years, going back to the early Bronze Age (3150 to 1200 BC). Its origin can be traced to the Levant based on written tablets, olive pits, and wood fragments found in ancient tombs.The immediate ancestry of the cultivated olive is unknown. Fossil Olea pollen has been found in Macedonia and other places around the Mediterranean, indicating that this genus is an original element of the Mediterranean flora. Fossilized leaves of Olea were found in the palaeosols of the volcanic Greek island of Santorini (Thera) and were dated about 37,000 BP. Imprints of larvae of olive whitefly Aleurolobus (Aleurodes) olivinus were found on the leaves. The same insect is commonly found today on olive leaves, showing that the plant-animal co-evolutionary relations have not changed since that time. Other leaves found on the same island are dated back to 60,000 BP, making them the oldest known olives from the Mediterranean.As far back as 3000 BC, olives were grown commercially in Crete; they may have been the source of the wealth of the Minoan civilization.\n\n\n=== Outside the Mediterranean ===\nOlives are not native to the Americas. Spanish colonists brought the olive to the New World, where its cultivation prospered in present-day Peru, Chile, and Argentina. The first seedlings from Spain were planted in Lima by Antonio de Rivera in 1560. Olive tree cultivation quickly spread along the valleys of South America's dry Pacific coast where the climate was similar to the Mediterranean. Spanish missionaries established the tree in the 18th century in California. It was first cultivated at Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1 in 1769 or later around 1795. Orchards were started at other missions, but in 1838, an inspection found only two olive orchards in California. Cultivation for oil gradually became a highly successful commercial venture from the 1860s onward. In Japan, the first successful planting of olive trees happened in 1908 on Shodo Island, which became the cradle of olive cultivation. An estimated 865 million olive trees were in the world as of 2005, and the vast majority of these were found in Mediterranean countries, with traditionally marginal areas accounting for no more than 25% of olive-planted area and 10% of oil production.\n\n\n== Symbolic connotations ==\n\nOlive oil has long been considered sacred and holy. The olive branch has often been a symbol of abundance, glory, and peace. The leafy branches of the olive tree were ritually offered to deities and powerful figures as emblems of benediction and purification, and they were used to crown the victors of friendly games and bloody wars. Today, olive oil is still used in many religious ceremonies. Over the years, the olive has also been used to symbolize wisdom,  fertility, power, and purity.\n\n\n=== Judaeo-Christianity ===\nOlives were one of the main elements in ancient Israelite cuisine. Olive oil was used for not only food and cooking, but also lighting, sacrificial offerings, ointment, and anointment for priestly or royal office.The olive tree is one of the first plants mentioned in the Hebrew Bible (the Christian Old Testament), and one of the most significant. An olive branch (or leaf, depending on translation) was brought back to Noah by a dove to demonstrate that the flood was over\n(Book of Genesis, 8:11).\nThe olive is listed in Deuteronomy 8:8 as one of the seven species that are noteworthy products of the Land of Israel. According to the Halakha, the Jewish law mandatory for all Jews, the olive is one of the seven species that require the recitation of me'eyn shalosh after they are consumed. Olive oil is also the most recommended and best possible oil for the lighting of the Shabbes candles.The Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem, is mentioned several times in the New Testament. The Allegory of the Olive Tree in St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans  refers to the scattering and gathering of Israel. It compares the Israelites to a tame olive tree and the Gentiles to a wild olive branch. The olive tree itself, as well as olive oil and olives, play an important role in the Bible.\n\n\n=== Ancient Greece ===\nOlives are thought to have been domesticated in the third millennium BC at the latest, at which point they, along with grain and grapes, became part of Colin Renfrew\u2019s triad of Greek staple crops that fueled the emergence of more complex societies. Olives, and especially (perfumed) olive oil, became a major export product during the Minoan and Mycenaean periods. Dutch archaeologist Jorrit Kelder proposed that the Mycenaeans sent shipments of olive oil, probably alongside live olive branches, to the court of the Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten as a diplomatic gift. In Egypt, these imported olive branches may have acquired ritual meanings, as they are depicted as offerings on the wall of the Aten temple and were used in wreaths for the burial of Tutankhamen. It is likely that, as well as being used for culinary purposes, olive oil was also used to various other ends, including as a perfume. \nThe ancient Greeks smeared olive oil on their bodies and hair as a matter of grooming and good health.\nOlive oil was used to anoint kings and athletes in ancient Greece. It was burnt in the sacred lamps of temples and was the \"eternal flame\" of the original Olympic games. Victors in these games were crowned with its leaves.\nIn Homer's Odyssey, Odysseus crawls beneath two shoots of olive that grow from a single stock, and in the Iliad, (XVII.53ff) there is a metaphoric description of a lone olive tree in the mountains, by a spring; the Greeks observed that the olive rarely thrives at a distance from the sea, which in Greece invariably means up mountain slopes. Greek myth attributed to the primordial culture-hero Aristaeus the understanding of olive husbandry, along with cheese-making and bee-keeping. Olive was one of the woods used to fashion the most primitive Greek cult figures, called xoana, referring to their wooden material; they were reverently preserved for centuries. It was purely a matter of local pride that the Athenians claimed that the olive grew first in Athens. In an archaic Athenian foundation myth, Athena won the patronage of Attica from Poseidon with the gift of the olive. According to the fourth-century BC father of botany, Theophrastus, olive trees ordinarily attained an age around 200 years, he mentions that the very olive tree of Athena still grew on the Acropolis; it was still to be seen there in the second century AD; and when Pausanias was shown it, c. 170 AD, he reported \"Legend also says that when the Persians fired Athens the olive was burnt down, but on the very day it was burnt it grew again to the height of two cubits.\" Indeed, olive suckers sprout readily from the stump, and the great age of some existing olive trees shows that it was perfectly possible that the olive tree of the Acropolis dated to the Bronze Age. The olive was sacred to Athena and appeared on the Athenian coinage.\nTheophrastus, in On the Causes of Plants, does not give as systematic and detailed an account of olive husbandry as he does of the vine, but he makes clear (in 1.16.10) that the cultivated olive must be vegetatively propagated; indeed, the pits give rise to thorny, wild-type olives, spread far and wide by birds. Theophrastus reports how the bearing olive can be grafted on the wild olive, for which the Greeks had a separate name, kotinos. In his Enquiry into Plants (2.1.2\u20134) he states that the olive can be propagated from a piece of the trunk, the root, a twig, or a stake.\n\n\n=== Ancient Rome ===\n\nAccording to Pliny the Elder, a vine, a fig tree, and an olive tree grew in the middle of the Roman Forum; the olive was planted to provide shade (the garden plot was recreated in the 20th century). The Roman poet Horace mentions it in reference to his own diet, which he describes as very simple: \"As for me, olives, endives, and smooth mallows provide sustenance.\" Lord Monboddo comments on the olive in 1779 as one of the foods preferred by the ancients and as one of the most perfect foods.\n\nVitruvius describes of the use of charred olive wood in tying together walls and foundations in his De Architectura:\n\nThe thickness of the wall should, in my opinion, be such that armed men meeting on top of it may pass one another without interference. In the thickness there should be set a very close succession of ties made of charred olive wood, binding the two faces of the wall together like pins, to give it lasting endurance. For that is a material which neither decay, nor the weather, nor time can harm, but even though buried in the earth or set in the water it keeps sound and useful forever. And so not only city walls but substructures in general and all walls that require a thickness like that of a city wall, will be long in falling to decay if tied in this manner.\n\n\n=== Islam ===\nThe olive tree and olive oil are mentioned seven times in the Quran, and the olive is praised as a precious fruit. Olive tree and olive oil health benefits have been propounded in Prophetic medicine. Muhammad is reported to have said: \"Take oil of olive and massage with it \u2013 it is a blessed tree\" (Sunan al-Darimi, 69:103).\nOlives are substitutes for dates (if not available) during Ramadan fasting, and olive tree leaves are used as incense in some Muslim Mediterranean countries.\n\n\n=== United States ===\nSince the Great Seal of the United States was finalized and approved on 20 June 1782, the eagle in the seal is depicted clutching an olive branch in one of its talons, indicating the power of peace.\n\n\n== Oldest known trees ==\n\nOlive trees in the groves around the Mediterranean Sea are centuries old, with some dated up to 3500 years. The olive tree of Mouriscas, Abrantes, Portugal, (Oliveira do Mouch\u00e3o) is one of the oldest known olive trees still alive to this day, with an estimated age of 3,350 years, planted approximately at the beginning of the Atlantic Bronze Age.\nAn olive tree on the island of Brijuni (Brioni), Istria in Croatia, has a radiocarbon dating age of about 1,600 years. It still gives fruit (about 30 kg or 66 lb per year), which is made into olive oil.\nAn olive tree in west Athens, named \"Plato's Olive Tree\", is thought to be a remnant of the grove where Plato's Academy was situated, making it an estimated 2,400 years old. The tree comprised a cavernous trunk from which a few branches were still sprouting in 1975, when a traffic accident caused a bus to uproot it. Following that, the trunk was preserved and displayed in the nearby Agricultural University of Athens. In 2013, it was reported that the remaining part of the trunk was uprooted and stolen, allegedly to serve as firewood. A supposedly older tree, the \"Peisistratos Tree\", is located by the banks of the Cephisus River, in the municipality of Agioi Anargyroi, and is said to be a remnant of an olive grove that was planted by Athenian tyrant Peisistratos in the sixth century BC. Numerous ancient olive trees also exist near Pelion in Greece. The age of an olive tree in Crete, the Finix Olive, is claimed to be over 2,000 years old; this estimate is based on archaeological evidence around the tree. The olive tree of Vouves, also in Crete, has an age estimated between 2000 and 4000 years. An olive tree called Farga d'Ari\u00f3 in Ulldecona, Catalonia, Spain, has been estimated (with laser-perimetry methods) to date back to 314 AD, which would mean that it was planted when Constantine the Great was Roman emperor.Some Italian olive trees are believed to date back to Ancient Rome (8th century BC to 5th century AD), although identifying progenitor trees in ancient sources is difficult. Several other trees of about 1,000 years old are within the same garden. The 15th-century trees of Olivo della Linza, at Alliste in the Province of Lecce in Apulia on the Italian mainland, were noted by Bishop Ludovico de Pennis during his pastoral visit to the Diocese of Nard\u00f2-Gallipoli in 1452.The town of Bshaale, Lebanon claims to have the oldest olive trees in the world (4000 BC for the oldest), but no scientific study supports these claims. Other trees in the towns of Amioun appear to be at least 1,500 years old.Throughout Israel and Palestine, dozens of ancient olive trees are found with estimated ages of 1,600\u20132,000 years; however, these estimates could not be supported by current scientific practices. Ancient trees include two giant olive trees in Arraba and five trees in Deir Hanna, both in the Galilee region, which have been determined to be over 3,000 years old, although no available data support the credibility of the study that produced these age estimates, and as such, the 3000 years age estimate can not be considered valid.  All seven trees continue to produce olives.\nSeveral trees in the Garden of Gethsemane (from the Hebrew words gat shemanim or olive press) in Jerusalem are claimed to date back to the time of Jesus. A study conducted by the National Research Council of Italy in 2012 used carbon dating on older parts of the trunks of three trees from Gethsemane and came up with the dates of 1092, 1166, and 1198 AD, while DNA tests show that the trees were originally planted from the same parent plant. According to molecular analysis, the tested trees showed the same allelic profile at all microsatellite loci analyzed which furthermore may indicate attempt to keep the lineage of an older species intact. However, Bernabei writes, \"All the tree trunks are hollow inside so that the central, older wood is missing . . . In the end, only three from a total of eight olive trees could be successfully dated.  The dated ancient olive trees do, however, not allow any hypothesis to be made with regard to the age of the remaining five giant olive trees.\" Babcox concludes, \"The roots of the eight oldest trees are possibly much older. Visiting guides to the garden often state that they are two thousand years old.\"The 2,000-year-old Bidni olive trees on the island of Malta, which have been confirmed through carbon dating, have been protected since 1933, and are also listed in UNESCO's Database of National Cultural Heritage Laws. In 2011, after recognising their historical and landscape value, and in recognition of the fact that \"only 20 trees remain from 40 at the beginning of the 20th century\", Maltese authorities declared the ancient Bidni olive grove at Bidnija, limits of Mosta, as a Tree Protected Area, in accordance with the provisions of the Trees and Woodlands Protection Regulations, 2011, as per Government Notice number 473/11.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Uses ==\n\nThe olive tree, Olea europaea, has been cultivated for olive oil, fine wood, olive leaf, ornamental reasons, and the olive fruit. About 90% of all harvested olives are turned into oil, while about 10% are used as table olives. The olive is one of the \"trinity\" or \"triad\" of basic ingredients in Mediterranean cuisine, the other two being wheat for bread, pasta, and couscous, and the grape for wine.\n\n\n=== Table olives ===\nTable olives are classified by the IOC into three groups according to the degree of ripeness achieved before harvesting:\nGreen olives are picked when they have obtained full size, while unripe; they are usually shades of green to yellow, and contain the bitter phytochemical, oleuropein.\nSemi-ripe or turning-colour olives are picked at the beginning of the ripening cycle, when the colour has begun to change from green to multicolour shades of red to brown. Only the skin is coloured, as the flesh of the fruit lacks pigmentation at this stage, unlike that of ripe olives.\nBlack olives or ripe olives are picked at full maturity when fully ripe, displaying colours of purple, brown or black. To leach the oleuropein from olives, commercial producers use lye, which neutralizes the bitterness of oleuropein, producing a mild flavour and soft texture characteristic of California black olives sold in cans. Such olives are typically preserved in brine and sterilized under high heat during the canning process.\n\n\n=== Traditional fermentation and curing ===\n\nRaw or fresh olives are naturally very bitter; to make them palatable, olives must be cured and fermented, thereby removing oleuropein, a bitter phenolic compound that can reach levels of 14% of dry matter in young olives. In addition to oleuropein, other phenolic compounds render freshly picked olives unpalatable and must also be removed or lowered in quantity through curing and fermentation. Generally speaking, phenolics reach their peak in young fruit and are converted as the fruit matures. Once ripening occurs, the levels of phenolics sharply decline through their conversion to other organic products which render some cultivars edible immediately. One example of an edible olive native to the island of Thasos is the throubes black olive, which when allowed to ripen in the sun, shrivel, and fall from the tree, is then edible.The curing process may take from a few days, with lye, to a few months with brine or salt packing. With the exception of California style and salt-cured olives, all methods of curing involve a major fermentation involving bacteria and yeast that is of equal importance to the final table olive product. Traditional cures, using the natural microflora on the fruit to induce fermentation, lead to two important outcomes: the leaching out and breakdown of oleuropein and other unpalatable phenolic compounds, and the generation of favourable metabolites from bacteria and yeast, such as organic acids, probiotics, glycerol, and esters, which affect the sensory properties of the final table olives. Mixed bacterial/yeast olive fermentations may have probiotic qualities. Lactic acid is the most important metabolite, as it lowers the pH, acting as a natural preservative against the growth of unwanted pathogenic species. The result is table olives which can be stored without refrigeration. Fermentations dominated by lactic acid bacteria are, therefore, the most suitable method of curing olives. Yeast-dominated fermentations produce a different suite of metabolites which provide poorer preservation, so they are corrected with an acid such as citric acid in the final processing stage to provide microbial stability.The many types of preparations for table olives depend on local tastes and traditions. The most important commercial examples are listed below.\nLebanese or Phenician Type (olives with fermentation): Applied to green, semiripe, or ripe olives. Olives are soaked in salt water for 24-48 hours. Then, they are slightly crushed with a rock to hasten the fermentation process. The olives are stored for a period of up to a year in a container with salt water, fresh lemon juice, lemon peels, laurel and olive leaves, and rosemary. Some recipes may contain white vinegar or olive oil.\nSpanish or Sevillian type (olives with fermentation): Most commonly applied to green olive preparation, around 60% of all the world's table olives are produced with this method. Olives are soaked in lye (dilute NaOH, 2\u20134%) for 8\u201310 hours to hydrolyse the oleuropein. They are usually considered \"treated\" when the lye has penetrated two-thirds of the way into the fruit. They are then washed once or several times in water to remove the caustic solution and transferred to fermenting vessels full of brine at typical concentrations of 8\u201312% NaCl. The brine is changed on a regular basis to help remove the phenolic compounds. Fermentation is carried out by the natural microbiota present on the olives that survive the lye treatment process. Many organisms are involved, usually reflecting the local conditions or \"Terroir\" of the olives. During a typical fermentation gram-negative enterobacteria flourish in small numbers at first, but are rapidly outgrown by lactic acid bacteria species such as Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis and Pediococcus damnosus. These bacteria produce lactic acid to help lower the pH of the brine and therefore stabilize the product against unwanted pathogenic species. A diversity of yeasts then accumulate in sufficient numbers to help complete the fermentation alongside the lactic acid bacteria. Yeasts commonly mentioned include the teleomorphs Pichia anomala, Pichia membranifaciens, Debaryomyces hansenii and Kluyveromyces marxianus. Once fermented, the olives are placed in fresh brine and acid corrected, to be ready for market.\nSicilian or Greek type (olives with fermentation): Applied to green, semiripe and ripe olives, they are almost identical to the Spanish type fermentation process, but the lye treatment process is skipped and the olives are placed directly in fermentation vessels full of brine (8\u201312% NaCl). The brine is changed on a regular basis to help remove the phenolic compounds. As the caustic treatment is avoided, lactic acid bacteria are only present in similar numbers to yeast and appear to be outdone by the abundant yeasts found on untreated olives. As very little acid is produced by the yeast fermentation, lactic, acetic, or citric acid is often added to the fermentation stage to stabilize the process.Picholine or directly-brined type (olives with fermentation): Applied to green, semi-ripe, or ripe olives, they are soaked in lye typically for longer periods than Spanish style (e.g. 10\u201372 hours) until the solution has penetrated three-quarters of the way into the fruit. They are then washed and immediately brined and acid corrected with citric acid to achieve microbial stability. Fermentation still occurs carried out by acidogenic yeast and bacteria, but is more subdued than other methods. The brine is changed on a regular basis to help remove the phenolic compounds and a series of progressively stronger concentrations of salt are added until the product is fully stabilized and ready to be eaten.Water-cured type (olives with fermentation): Applied to green, semi-ripe, or ripe olives, these are soaked in water or weak brine and this solution is changed on a daily basis for 10\u201314 days. The oleuropein is naturally dissolved and leached into the water and removed during a continual soak-wash cycle. Fermentation takes place during the water treatment stage and involves a mixed yeast/bacteria ecosystem. Sometimes, the olives are lightly cracked with a hammer or a stone to trigger fermentation and speed up the fermentation process. Once debittered, the olives are brined to concentrations of 8\u201312% NaCl and acid corrected, and are then ready to eat.Salt-cured type (olives with minor fermentation): Applied only to ripe olives, they are usually produced in Morocco, Turkey, and other eastern Mediterranean countries. Once picked, the olives are vigorously washed and packed in alternating layers with salt. The high concentrations of salt draw the moisture out of olives, dehydrating and shriveling them until they look somewhat analogous to a raisin. Once packed in salt, fermentation is minimal and only initiated by the most halophilic yeast species such as Debaryomyces hansenii. Once cured, they are sold in their natural state without any additives. So-called oil-cured olives are cured in salt, and then soaked in oil.California or \"artificial ripening\" type (olives without fermentation): Applied to green and semi-ripe olives, they are placed in lye and soaked. Upon their removal, they are washed in water injected with compressed air. This process is repeated several times until both oxygen and lye have soaked through to the pit. The repeated, saturated exposure to air oxidises the skin and flesh of the fruit, turning it black in an artificial process that mimics natural ripening. Once fully oxidised or \"blackened\", they are brined and acid corrected and are then ready for eating.\n\n\n=== Olive wood ===\nOlive wood is very hard and is prized for its durability, colour, high combustion temperature, and interesting grain patterns.  Because of the commercial importance of the fruit, and the slow growth and relatively small size of the tree, olive wood and its products are relatively expensive.  Common uses of the wood include: kitchen utensils, carved wooden bowls, cutting boards, fine furniture, and decorative items.\nThe yellow or light greenish-brown wood is often finely veined with a darker tint; being very hard and close-grained, it is valued by woodworkers.\n\n\n=== Ornamental uses ===\nIn modern landscape design olive trees are frequently used as ornamental features for their distinctively gnarled trunks and \"evergreen\" silvery gray foliage.\n\n\n== Cultivation ==\n\nThe earliest evidence for the domestication of olives comes from the Chalcolithic period archaeological site of Teleilat el Ghassul in what is today modern Jordan. Farmers in ancient times believed that olive trees would not grow well if planted more than a certain distance from the sea; Theophrastus gives 300 stadia (55.6 km or 34.5 mi) as the limit. Modern experience does not always confirm this, and, though showing a preference for the coast, they have long been grown further inland in some areas with suitable climates, particularly in the southwestern Mediterranean (Iberia, northwest Africa) where winters are mild. An article on Olive tree cultivation in Spain is brought down in Ibn al-'Awwam's 12th-century agricultural work, Book on Agriculture.\n\nOlives are cultivated in many regions of the world with Mediterranean climates, such as South Africa, Chile, Peru, Australia, Oregon, and California, and in areas with temperate climates such as New Zealand. They are also grown in the C\u00f3rdoba Province, Argentina, which has a temperate climate with rainy summers and dry winters.\n\n\n=== Growth and propagation ===\n\nOlive trees show a marked preference for calcareous soils, flourishing best on limestone slopes and crags, and coastal climate conditions. They grow in any light soil, even on clay if well drained, but in rich soils, they are predisposed to disease and produce poorer oil than in poorer soil. (This was noted by Pliny the Elder.) Olives like hot weather and sunny positions without any shade, while temperatures below \u221210 \u00b0C (14 \u00b0F) may injure even a mature tree. They tolerate drought well, due to their sturdy and extensive root systems. Olive trees can live for several centuries and can remain productive for as long if they are pruned correctly and regularly.\nOnly a handful of olive varieties can be used to cross-pollinate. 'Pendolino' olive trees are partially self-fertile, but pollenizers are needed for a large fruit crop. Other compatible olive tree pollinators include 'Leccino' and 'Maurino'. 'Pendolino' olive trees are used extensively as pollinizers in large olive tree groves.\n\nOlives are propagated by various methods. The preferred ways are cuttings and layers; the tree roots easily in favourable soil and throws up suckers from the stump when cut down. However, yields from trees grown from suckers or seeds are poor; they must be budded or grafted onto other specimens to do well. Branches of various thickness cut into lengths around 1 m (3.3 ft) planted deeply in manured ground soon vegetate. Shorter pieces are sometimes laid horizontally in shallow trenches and, when covered with a few centimetres of soil, rapidly throw up sucker-like shoots. In Greece, grafting the cultivated tree on the wild tree is a common practice. In Italy, embryonic buds, which form small swellings on the stems, are carefully excised and planted under the soil surface, where they soon form a vigorous shoot.\nThe olive is also sometimes grown from seed. To facilitate germination, the oily pericarp is first softened by slight rotting, or soaked in hot water or in an alkaline solution.\nIn situations where extreme cold has damaged or killed the olive tree, the rootstock can survive and produce new shoots which in turn become new trees. In this way, olive trees can regenerate themselves. In Tuscany in 1985, a very severe frost destroyed many productive, and aged, olive trees and ruined many farmers' livelihoods. However, new shoots appeared in the spring and, once the dead wood was removed, became the basis for new fruit-producing trees. In this way, an olive tree can live for centuries or even millennia.\nOlives grow very slowly, and over many years, the trunk can attain a considerable diameter. A. P. de Candolle recorded one exceeding 10 m (33 ft) in girth. The trees rarely exceed 15 m (49 ft) in height, and are generally confined to much more limited dimensions by frequent pruning.\nOlea europaea is very hardy: drought-, disease- and fire-resistant, it can live to a great age. Its root system is robust and capable of regenerating the tree even if the above-ground structure is destroyed. The older the olive tree, the broader and more gnarled the trunk becomes. Many olive trees in the groves around the Mediterranean are said to be hundreds of years old, while an age of 2,000 years is claimed for a number of individual trees; in some cases, this has been scientifically verified. See paragraph dealing with the topic.\nThe crop from old trees is sometimes enormous, but they seldom bear well two years in succession, and in many cases, a large harvest occurs every sixth or seventh season.\nWhere the olive is carefully cultivated, as in Languedoc and Provence, the trees are regularly pruned. The pruning preserves the flower-bearing shoots of the preceding year, while keeping the tree low enough to allow the easy gathering of the fruit.\nThe spaces between the trees are regularly fertilized.\n\n\n=== Pests, diseases, and weather ===\nVarious pathologies can affect olives. The most serious pest is the olive fruit fly (Dacus oleae or Bactrocera oleae) which lays its eggs in the olive most commonly just before it becomes ripe in the autumn. The region surrounding the puncture rots, becomes brown, and takes a bitter taste, making the olive unfit for eating or for oil. For controlling the pest, the practice has been to spray with insecticides (organophosphates, e.g. dimethoate).  Classic organic methods have now been applied such as trapping, applying the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis, and spraying with kaolin.  Such methods are obligatory for organic olives.\nA fungus, Cycloconium oleaginum, can infect the trees for several successive seasons, causing great damage to plantations. A species of bacterium, Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. oleae, induces tumour growth in the shoots. Certain lepidopterous caterpillars feed on the leaves and flowers.\nXylella fastidiosa bacteria, which can also infect citrus fruit and vines, has attacked olive trees in Apulia (Puglia), southern Italy causing the olive quick decline syndrome (OQDS). The main vector is Philaenus spumarius (meadow spittlebug).A pest which spreads through olive trees is the black scale bug, a small black scale insect that resembles a small black spot. They attach themselves firmly to olive trees and reduce the quality of the fruit; their main predators are wasps. The curculio beetle eats the edges of leaves, leaving sawtooth damage.Rabbits eat the bark of olive trees and can do considerable damage, especially to young trees. If the bark is removed around the entire circumference of a tree, it is likely to die. Voles and mice also do damage by eating the roots of olives.\nAt the northern edge of their cultivation zone, for instance in southern France and north-central Italy, olive trees suffer occasionally from frost. Gales and long-continued rains during the gathering season also cause damage.\n\n\n=== As an invasive species ===\n\nSince its first domestication, O. europaea has been spreading back to the wild from planted groves. Its original wild populations in southern Europe have been largely swamped by feral plants.In some other parts of the world where it has been introduced, most notably South Australia, the olive has become a major woody weed that displaces native vegetation. In South Australia, its seeds are spread by the introduced red fox and by many bird species, including the European starling and the non-native emu, into woodlands, where they germinate and eventually form a dense canopy that prevents regeneration of native trees. As the climate of South Australia is very dry and bushfire prone, the oil-rich feral olive tree substantially increases the fire hazard of native sclerophyll woodlands.\n\n\n=== Harvest and processing ===\n\nOlives are harvested in the autumn and winter. More specifically in the Northern Hemisphere, green olives are picked from the end of September to about the middle of November. Blond olives are picked from the middle of October to the end of November, and black olives are collected from the middle of November to the end of January or early February. In southern Europe, harvesting is done for several weeks in winter, but the time varies in each country, and with the season and the cultivar.\nMost olives today are harvested by shaking the boughs or the whole tree. Using olives found lying on the ground can result in poor quality oil, due to damage. Another method involves standing on a ladder and \"milking\" the olives into a sack tied around the harvester's waist. This method produces high quality oil.  A third method uses a device called an oli-net that wraps around the tree trunk and opens to form an umbrella-like catcher from which workers collect the fruit. Another method uses an electric tool, the oliviera, that has large tongs that spin around quickly, removing fruit from the tree. Olives harvested by this method are used for oil.\nTable olive varieties are more difficult to harvest, as workers must take care not to damage the fruit; baskets that hang around the worker's neck are used. In some places in Italy, Croatia, and Greece, olives are harvested by hand because the terrain is too mountainous for machines. As a result, the fruit is not bruised, which leads to a superior finished product. The method also involves sawing off branches, which is healthy for future production.The amount of oil contained in the fruit differs greatly by cultivar; the pericarp is usually 60\u201370% oil. Typical yields are 1.5\u20132.2 kg (3.3\u20134.9 lb) of oil per tree per year.Processing olives is done through curing and fermentation or drying in order for them to be edible. Lye and salt brine are used to cure olives from their bitter oleuropein compound. Olives are fermented by yeast and the brine allows bacteria to add flavor and act as a natural preservative by lowering the pH from other bacteria that would lead to spoilage.\n\n\n== Global production ==\nOlives are one of the most extensively cultivated fruit crops in the world. In 2011, about 9.6 million hectares (24 million acres) were planted with olive trees, which is more than twice the amount of land devoted to apples, bananas, or mangoes. Only coconut trees and oil palms command more space. Cultivation area tripled from 2.6 to 7.95 million hectares (6.4 to 19.6 million acres) between 1960 and 1998 and reached a peak of 10 million hectares (25 million acres) in 2008. The 10 largest producing countries, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization, are all located in the Mediterranean region and produce 95% of the world's olives.\n\n\n== Nutrition ==\nOne hundred grams of cured green olives provide 146 calories, are a rich source of vitamin E (25% of the Daily Value, DV), and contain a large amount of sodium (104% DV); other nutrients are insignificant. Green olives are 75% water, 15% fat, 4% carbohydrates and 1% protein (table).\nThe polyphenol composition of olive fruits varies during fruit ripening and during processing by fermentation when olives are immersed whole in brine or crushed to produce oil. In raw fruit, total polyphenol contents, as measured by the Folin method, are 117 mg/100 g in black olives and 161 mg/100 g in green olives, compared to 55 and 21 mg/100 g for extra virgin and virgin olive oil, respectively. Olive fruit contains several types of polyphenols, mainly tyrosols, phenolic acids, flavonols and flavones, and for black olives, anthocyanins. The main bitter flavor of olives before curing results from oleuropein and its aglycone which total in content, respectively, 72 and 82 mg/100 g in black olives, and 56 and 59 mg/100 g in green olives.During the crushing, kneading and extraction of olive fruit to obtain olive oil, oleuropein, demethyloleuropein and ligstroside are hydrolyzed by endogenous beta-glucosidases to form aldehydic aglycones.\nPolyphenol content also varies with olive cultivar (Spanish Manzanillo highest) and the manner of presentation, with plain olives having higher contents than those that are pitted or stuffed.\n\n\n== Allergenic potential ==\nOlive tree pollen is extremely allergenic, with an OPALS allergy scale rating of 10 out of 10. Olea europaea is primarily wind-pollinated, and their light, buoyant pollen is a strong trigger for asthma. One popular variety, \"Swan Hill\", is widely sold as an \"allergy-free\" olive tree; however, this variety does bloom and produce allergenic pollen.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\nMoria (tree)\nList of olive cultivars\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAgricultural Research Service, US Department of Agriculture; Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN): Olea europaea\nMost Common Spanish Olea Trees, Ginart Oleas", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/21-alimenti%2C_olio%2CTaccuino_Sanitatis%2C_Casanatense_4182..jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Alliste._Olivo_della_Linza.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Cristoforo_munari-bodegon.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Crop-forecast.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Filet_Olive_de_Nice.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Flag_of_Algeria.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Flag_of_Egypt.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Flag_of_Europe.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Flag_of_Greece.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Flag_of_Morocco.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Flag_of_Portugal.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Flag_of_Syria.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Flag_of_Tunisia.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Flag_of_Turkey.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/GraberOliveHouseVatRoom.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Gr%C3%BCne_Oliven.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Invasive_weeds_in_the_adelaide_hills.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Old_olive_tree_in_Karystos%2C_Euboia%2C_Greece.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Old_olive_tree_in_Maslina_Ka%C5%A1tela%2C_Croatia.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Olea_europaea_-_K%C3%B6hler%E2%80%93s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-229.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Olea_europaea_range.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Olea_europaea_young_plant01.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Olive-tree-trunk-0.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Olive_Grove_prunings_in_neat_rows._Ostuni%2C_Puglia.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Olive_Phenology.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Olive_blossoms.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Olive_niche.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Old_olive_tree_in_Karystos%2C_Euboia%2C_Greece.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/Olive_trees_A-3176_1.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/42/Olivenhain_Alexandroupolis.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/09/Olives_au_marche_de_Toulon_p1040238.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Olives_in_cup.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Olives_vertes.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d3/Olives_%C3%A0_l%27ap%C3%A9ritif.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Olivesfromjordan.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Porducci%C3%B3n_de_olivas.PNG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/Roman_fresco_of_a_woman_wearing_a_garland_of_olives%2C_from_Herculaneum.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Schwarze_Oliven.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Shodoshima_Olive_Park_Shodo_Island_Japan23bs34.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Ulivone_di_Canneto_Sabino.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/03/Flag_of_Italy.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9a/Flag_of_Spain.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg"], "summary": "The olive, known by the botanical name Olea europaea, meaning \"European olive\", is a species of small tree in the family Oleaceae, found traditionally in the Mediterranean Basin.

"content": "Lebanese cuisine (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0628\u062e \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646\u064a\u200e) is the culinary traditions and practices originating from Lebanon. It includes an abundance of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, fresh fish and seafood. Poultry is eaten more often than red meat, and when red meat is eaten, it is usually lamb and goat meat. It also includes copious amounts of garlic and olive oil, often seasoned with lemon juice. Chickpeas and parsley are also staples of the Lebanese diet.Well-known savoury dishes include baba ghanouj, a dip made of char-grilled eggplant; falafel, small deep-fried balls or patties made of highly spiced ground chickpeas, fava beans, or a combination of the two; and shawarma, a sandwich with marinated meat skewered and cooked on large rods. An important component of many Lebanese meals is hummus, a dip or spread made of blended chickpeas, tahini, lemon juice, and garlic, typically eaten with flatbread.A well-known dessert is baklava, which is made of layered filo (thinly rolled pastry) filled with nuts and steeped in date syrup or honey. Some desserts are specifically prepared on special occasions; for example, meghli (rice pudding dessert, spiced with anise, caraway, and cinnamon) is served to celebrate a newborn baby in the family.Arak is an anise-flavoured moonshine, and is the Lebanese national drink, usually served with a traditional convivial Lebanese meal. Another historic and traditional drink is Lebanese wine.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nLebanese cuisine has ancient roots and is part of the cuisine of the Levant. Many dishes in Lebanese cuisine can be traced back thousands of years to eras of Roman, Greek, Persian, Neo-Babylonian, Byzantine, Arab, Egyptian, and Phoenician rule.In the last 500 years, Lebanese cuisine has been influenced by the different foreign civilizations that held power. From 1516 to 1918, the Ottoman Turks controlled Lebanon and introduced a variety of foods that have become staples in the Lebanese diet, such as cooking with lamb. \nAfter the Ottomans were defeated in World War I (1914\u20131918), France took control of Lebanon until 1943, when the country achieved its independence. The French introduced foods such as flan, a caramel custard dessert dating back to the 16th century AD, eclairs, french fries and croissants.The Lebanese diaspora who live worldwide have introduced new ingredients, spices and culinary practices into Lebanese cuisine, keeping the cuisine innovative and renowned both beyond and within its borders.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nMost often, foods are grilled, baked or lightly cooked in olive oil; butter or cream is rarely used, other than in a few desserts. Vegetables are often eaten raw, pickled, or cooked. \nLike most Mediterranean countries, much of what the Lebanese eat is dictated by the seasons and what is available. Lebanese cuisine also varies by region. \n\nSouth Lebanon is famous for its kibbe, the Beqaa Valley for its meat pastries (such as sfiha), and north Lebanon and Saida (Sidon) for its sweets.In Lebanon, very rarely are drinks served without being accompanied by food. Similar to the tapas of Spain, mezeluri of Romania and aperitivo of Italy, mezze is an array of small dishes placed before the guests creating an array of colors, flavors, textures and aromas. This style of serving food is less a part of family life than it is of entertaining and caf\u00e9s. \nMezze may be as simple as raw or pickled vegetables, hummus, baba ghanouj and bread, or it may become an entire meal consisting of grilled marinated seafood, skewered meats and a variety of cooked and raw salads and an arrangement of desserts. The assortments of dishes forming the mezze are generally consumed in small bites using a piece of flatbread.A typical mezze will consist of an elaborate variety of 30 or so hot and cold dishes, which may include:\n\nSalads such as tabbouleh and fattoush\nDips like hummus, baba ghanoush and moutabal\nKebbeh, kafta and falafel (fried chickpea balls)\nSome patties such as the sambusac\nStuffed grape leaves and pickles\nRoasted nuts, olives and vegetables\nCondiments like toum and taratour, ideal for spread on sfihaWhen dining as a family, the mezze typically consists of three or four dishes, but when served in the restaurant, the mezze can range from 20 to 60 dishes, as the variant combinations and dishes involved are plenty.Family cuisine also offers a range of dishes, such as stews (yakhneh) which can be cooked in many forms depending on the ingredients used and are usually served with meat and rice.Although simple fresh fruits are often served towards the end of a Lebanese meal, there is also dessert, such as baklava and coffee.  When sweets are not available, fruits are typically eaten after meals, including figs, oranges and other citrus fruits, apples, grapes, cherries and green plums (janarek). Although baklava is the most internationally known dessert, there is a great variety of Lebanese desserts.\n\n\n== Dishes and ingredients ==\nLebanese dishes are heavily influenced by the multiple civilisations that have existed within the region, which has accumulated together to form the modern Lebanese cuisine we know today. Using fresh, flavourful ingredients and spices, Lebanese cuisine combines Turkish, Arab, and French cooking styles. Characteristics include the use of lamb (introduced by the Ottomans); the abundant use of nuts, especially almonds and pine nuts; and dressings made from lemon juice.\n\n\n=== Bread ===\nThe Lebanese use bread, usually flatbread, as an integral part of a meal and food is generally not served without it. Pita bread with a pocket, known as khubz Arabi (Arab bread), is widely popular, and may be cut or torn up to dip in various dishes, or be stuffed as a sandwich or wrap with ingredients such as falafel or shawarma. Taboon bread is traditionally baked in a taboon oven or a tannur, and is similar to the various tandoor breads found in many parts of Asia.Marquq is prepared much thinner, almost paper thin, and cooked on a metal saj or pan.Ka'ak is another common Lebanese street bread that is usually consumed as a snack. There are many variations of ka'ak, from being sprinkled with traditional sesame seeds to being stuffed with cheese and za'atar.Manaeesh (mini-pizza) traditionally garnished with cheese (kashk, in its Lebanese version), za'atar, spicy diced tomatoes and may be eaten for breakfast. These are made in many variants in a number of local bakeries or furns. Some bakeries allow customers to bring their own toppings in order to build their own customized manaeesh for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.Variants include manakousheh za'atar (thyme pizza) and manakousheh jebneh which has only cheese.Manaeesh dough can also be eaten with minced meat and onions which is called lahm bi 'ajin. Mini versions are called sfeeha. The same dough can be made into a triangular pie called fatayer, filled with spinach, onions and sumac.\n\n\n=== Dairy ===\nCheese, as well as yogurt and eggs, are commonly used in Lebanon. One of the more recognizable dishes within Lebanon is labneh. Unlike regular yogurt, labneh is strained so as to remove the watery whey, leaving a thicker, creamier consistency. It is spreadable and garnished with olive oil and sea salt. It is an extremely versatile dish that can be served in a mezze platter for either breakfast or dinner.  A variant is mixed with garlic.Ejjeh is the traditional omelette of Lebanon. It is made with egg, chopped parsley and scallions. Within Lebanon, people make this omelette with different herbs that are cultivated from their village.\n\n\n==== Cheeses ====\nAckawi (also akkawi), is a salty white cheese made from pasteurized cow's milk but can also be made with goat's or sheep's milk.\nBaladi cheese has a mild yet rich flavor. It is called the \"cheese of the mountains\" since it is made in the high mountains by local shepherds in Lebanon.\nFeta is used in salads and other dishes, although some cooks will use a milder cheese called jibtieh baidha (simply \"white cheese\").\nHalloum is a semi-hard unripened cheese, perfect for grilling and frying. Along with akkawi, it is traditionally stored in brine, giving it a strong, salty taste, though modern methods have allowed fresher varieties with less salt.\nKashkaval is a cheese popular in many Eastern European countries that has made its way into Lebanese cuisine. It melts very quickly and is practical for pasta, pizza and sandwiches.\nNabulsi is similar to halloumi, made by boiling fresh ackawi cheese in a mixture of spices and seeds which are then fried, grilled or eaten and used in the popular dessert knafeh, a cheese pastry soaked in a sugar-based syrup.\nShanklish is made from cow's milk, salted, fermented and seasoned with thyme and pepper and formed into cheese balls, coated in red pepper chilli flakes.\n\n\n=== Stews ===\nLebanese stews, often served with rice or flatbread, are made with ingredients found locally available. \n\nOkra and tomato stew ( \u0628\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0632\u064a\u062a, bamieh bi-zeit) is one of the most popular. Traditionally, it is served with rice and a basic salad dressed with lemon juice and olive oil, with fresh warm bread. This stew combines the distinct flavor of okra with a flavourful tomato sauce. An alternative version, bamya bel lahmeh, adds small pieces of filleted lamb or beef that have been saut\u00e9ed beforehand to avoid a boiled taste.\nBean stews are common where various beans are grown. An example of a mixed bean Lebanese stew is makhlouta made of a variety of beans, wheat, and legumes, popular in the town of Baskinta. Others include fava bean stew, kidney bean stew (fasoulya hamanieh) and another kidney and lentil stew called mjadrat fasoulya popular in Rashaya. Taro and lentil stew (abu shoushe) and spinach stew (yakhnet sabanikh) are a few of the others available.Mulukhiyah is a stew with mallow leaves, chicken, beef, and in the Lebanese fashion, topped with raw chopped onions, and vinegar. In northern Lebanon, one like mulukhiyah is called mloukhiye b'zeit, made using fresh leaves and shoots of the Nalta jute plant, cooked with olive oil, onions, garlic, tomatoes and chilli peppers, a popular summer side dish, especially in Miniyeh-Danniyeh and Akkar districts.In summer one of the easiest and simplest ways to make use of the abundant summer zucchini is mfaraket koussa (spicy zucchini stew). Daoud bacha, another meat-based stew, consists of beef meatballs (also lamb) with cinnamon, parsley, and stuffed with pinenuts in a tomato sauce.\n\n\n=== Vegetarian ===\nVegetarian cuisine plays an important role in the cuisine of Lebanon. Being located in the Levant, vegetables and herbs (wild or cultivated) are abundant in the fertile landscape and serve as a main base of the cuisine. Some of the most popular street foods in Lebanon are vegetarian including fava beans, hot roasted peanuts served in a paper cone, prickly pears (served peeled and on ice), ful medames (fava beans) and balila (chickpeas seasoned with cumin).Nearly everything can be cooked either with meat or b\u2019zeit (oil), from beans to fish, stews and spinach. Meat was traditionally precious and usually served on a Sunday, but was expensive and usually eaten with bulgur or rice to prolong the shelf life. \n\nFor Lebanese Christians, including Catholic (Maronites and Melkites) and Orthodox, fasting from meat is practiced over the Lenten period (from midnight to noon) during Easter. Where abstention of meat is observed, the food is referred to as akl aateh (meaning food \"cut\" from the diet, such as meat or absent from meat), the particular food that is \"cut\" varies over different traditions.\n\n\n==== Salads ====\n\nFattoush (also called \"peasants' salad\") is made with pita, cucumbers, tomatoes, chickweed, and mint.\nTabbouleh is a diced parsley salad with bulgur wheat, tomato, mint and served with lettuce, eaten within a mezze or as a standalone dish as a precursor to a main course.Yogurt cheese salad consists of shanklish balls (yogurt cheese, feta, chilli powder, thyme, cumin, salt and pepper) added to a freshly prepared salad. It is distinctively Lebanese as is a perfect addition for mezze, complimenting Arab and Lebanese wines.\n\n\n==== Stuffed dishes ====\nWara' enab (\u0648\u0631\u0642 \u0639\u0646\u0628) is a dish commonly served as a mezze (appetizer), stuffed with either rice and meat or just rice. Another stuffed dish kousa mahshi (\u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u062a\u062d\u0636\u064a\u0631) consists of various kinds of squash or zucchini stuffed with rice and sometimes meat and cooked on the stovetop or in the oven.\n\n\n==== Chickpea-based dishes ====\nChickpea dishes include falafel (deep-fried balls or patties made of highly spiced ground chickpeas), hummus (a popular dip for pita bread made of blended chickpeas, sesame tahini, lemon juice, and garlic) and its variants including, hummus ras asfour (with meat on top) and fateh b'hummus, (a dish of chickpeas, flatbread pieces and spiced yogurt). Balila (cumin chickpeas), is a simple yet popular Lebanese dish that has been boiled along with lemon juice, garlic and various spices.\n\n\n==== Aubergine-based dishes ====\nAubergine (eggplant) dishes are common in Lebanon. They include well-known dishes such as baba ghanouj (a char-grilled aubergine, made with tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, and garlic puree), mutabbel (mashed cooked aubergines and tahini, mixed with salt, pepper, olive oil, with anar seeds) and makdous, a stuffed eggplant dish served with olive oil.Fried aubergine is also served alongside other fried vegetables including potatoes, cauliflower, courgettes (zucchinis), onions and tomatoes, usually referred to as a \"mixed fry up\".One of the most popular dishes in the Levant is fatteh, and the popular variant fatet batinjan (eggplant casserole) is served with yoghurt, fried bread,  aubergine, and mat\u00e9.Unlike the Greek style, Lebanese moussaka is a vegetarian eggplant dish, made with fried eggplant simmered in an onion and tomato sauce with chickpeas.\n\n\n==== Bean and legume dishes ====\nLebanese-style ful (cooked fava beans) is a slow-cooked mash of brown beans, sometimes with chickpeas, dressed with lemon, olive oil, and cumin. Riz bil-foul is another dish with fava beans, seasoned with various spices and served with rice.Mujaddara (imjaddarra) is a popular dish found throughout the Middle East and consists of cooked lentils together with wheat or rice, garnished with sauteed onions.\n\n\n=== Meats ===\nLebanese meat dishes are usually made with chicken or lamb, though pork is also eaten (albeit not as widely, due to Islamic dietary laws). However, meat is expensive everywhere and not always readily available. \n\n\n==== Mixed meat ====\nShawarma is a commonly found form of street food made with slow-cooked skewered meat (either chicken, lamb or beef) that is thinly sliced and served as a sandwich with toppings such as onions, pickles and tomatoes. Styles of this dish include shawarma lahmeh, grilled meat with parsley, onion and tarator, and shawarma djeij which is grilled poultry with toum and lettuce.\nSambousek (also called samboosak, or sambousak bi-lahm) is a small stuffed pastry often filled with meat and served as an appetizer (mezze). Though usually filled with ground beef or lamb, sambousek can also be filled with cheese or other fillings.\nKibbeh is a filled bulgur dough made with ground meat and can be made in different forms including fried (kibbeh raas), uncooked (kibbeh nayyeh), baked (kibbeh bil-saneeya), and all may be served with yogurt. Some regional versions of kibbeh are a pumpkin-flavoured kebbe lakteen (popular in Beit Mery) and kebbe zghartweih which is an oven-cooked version popular in Ehden.\nKubideh is a type of kebab served with pivaz, a relish made of minced parsley, onions, ground cumin and sumac.\nKafta is made with spiced ground meat that is shaped into small patties or rolled into meatball-shaped balls which are then baked, pan-fried or charcoal-grilled on skewers. Kafta is served with bread and other side dishes.\n\n\n==== Lamb ====\nHabra (raw lamb fillet) is essential for most dishes involving lamb. It is the foundation for many popular dishes including kibbeh nayyeh (minced raw lamb) and other variants of kibbeh. The fillet needs to be prepared and chilled for a minimum of 2 hours, and can even be prepared one day in advance. Dehen, somewhat like a meat shortening made from lamb-tail fat, fried lamb pieces and spices, is often used to give dishes a light meaty flavour without the expense of bulk meat.\nBarout del batata \u2013 spicy lamb served with potatoes.\nDeleh mehshi \u2013 stuffed rib cage of lamb (popular in Broummana).\nLaban Immo \u2013 cooked yoghurt and lamb with rice (popular in Douma).\nKafta meshwi  \u2013 minced lamb mixed with finely chopped onion and parsley, broiled on a skewer over charcoal.\nQawarma \u2013 originates from a centuries-old custom that was to buy a fat-tailed lamb in the spring and force-feed it day and night with mulberry and grape leaves, wheat hulls and other ingredients ending in a succulent chopped lamb dish, salted and kept in the grease of the animal.\nSfiha (also lahm b'ajin) \u2013 pastries covered with mutton minced meat, onions, and nuts popular in the Lebanese town of Baalbek.\nShish barak (Lebanese ravioli) \u2013 meat dumplings in yogurt sauce.\nKhash \u2013 boiled sheep parts, which might include the head, feet, and stomach (tripe).\n\n\n==== Chicken ====\n\nChich taouk \u2013 charcoaled grilled chicken marinated with garlic, lemon, and spices including cinnamon and cumin\nDjaj meshwi \u2013 grilled, spiced mildly chicken on bbq marinated with a garlic lemon sauce.\nFarrouj meshwi \u2013 grilled chicken, served with garlic sauce.\nJwenih (or Jawaneh) \u2013 chicken wings cooked with coriander, garlic and lemon, served as mezze.\nRiz bi-djaj \u2013 chicken and rice.\nShish taouk \u2013 grilled chicken skewers that utilize only white meat, marinated in olive oil, lemon, parsley, and sumac, served on a bed of rice with almonds and pine nuts.\n\n\n==== Beef ====\n\nPastirma \u2013 cured, seasoned dried beef, introduced by the Ottomans.\nTabbouleh bi dehn \u2013 another version of tabbouleh and is cooked with lentils and beef ghee.\nGhameh \u2013 a delicacy of stuffed cow intestines.\nKafta bithine \u2013 spiced meat with sesame concentrate, popular in Beit ed-Dine.\nKafta nayyeh \u2013 raw beef tartarre\n\n\n==== Fish ====\nSamkeh harra \u2013 grilled fish that has been marinated with chili, citrus, and cilantro.\nAkhtabout \u2013 grilled octopus (usually served with Samkeh Harra in Beirut).\nSayadieh \u2013 delicately spiced fish served on a bed of rice. Fish cooked in saffron and served on rice with onions, sumac, and a tahini sauce (the most important part of the dish) originated in Sidon.\n\n\n=== Sweets ===\nThe modern form of Lebanese desserts have been influenced by Ottoman cuisine and share many similarities with other neighbouring countries. Muhallebi is a milk pudding made with rice, milk and sugar. Like many other Lebanese desserts, it is sweetened with attar syrup and served with a garnish of assorted nuts. Barazeh, (also found in Syrian cuisine), are cookies with a light and crumbly texture; one side is decorated with sesame seeds and the other side with pistachios. Ma'amoul are crumbly cookies filled with pistachios, walnuts or dates. Lebanese Christians serve ma'amoul with atar syrup for Easter, as well as a cake flavored with anise and mahlab. \nPastry shops in Tripoli offer baklava along with other local specialty pastries like halawet el jibn, filled with sweetened cheese and topped with atar, pistachios, clotted cream (ashta) and rose jam. Baklava is made of a layered pastry filled with nuts and steeped in attar syrup (orange or rose water and sugar), usually cut into a triangular or diamond shape when served, which is the particular style that originated in Lebanon. Znoud al-sit is a syrup-soaked rolled pastry filled with clotted cream and garnished in typical fashion with nuts, orange peels and dates to the 19th century. Kanafeh is a dessert stuffed with white cheese (such as akkawi cheese), nuts and syrup made with made with kadayif dough.Semolina is used in the preparation of several Lebanese desserts like the pistachio-filled cookie karabij (or aleppo cookies), flavored with mahlab and cinnamon, topped with natef, which is similar to meringue. Mafroukeh is a semolina dough layered with caramel and butter, soaked in atar and served with clotted cream and assorted nuts. It can also be used to make cakes like nammoura. Sfouf is a cake made with semolina flour and turmeric. It is cake consumed on birthdays, family reunions, and religious holidays.Lebanese ice cream is popular with its eastern flavors, including amar al-din made from dried apricot paste. Booza is a type of ice-cream commonly referred to as Arabic ice cream, and is filled with Middle Eastern aromas. It is traditionally made through a process of pounding and stretching in a freezer drum, instead of the more usual churning method used in other ice creams.\n\n\n=== Condiments and spices ===\nTahini \u2013 sesame paste.\nTarator \u2013 tahini, water,  garlic and lemon dip.\nToum \u2013 garlic sauce.\nShatta \u2013 chili sauce popular in the Middle East.\nMuhammara \u2013 muhammara or mhammara is a hot pepper dip originally from Aleppo, Syria, found in Levantine and Turkish cuisines.\nSumac \u2013 a tangy spice used in many salads.\nZa'atar \u2013 dried thyme and sumac that can differ from region to region and from family to family. Most are made in house, but can be bought at Lebanese larders.\nLebanese spice blend (also called Lebanese seven spice) \u2013 a mixture of equal parts of allspice, black pepper, cinnamon, cloves, fenugreek, nutmeg and ginger. It is commonly used to flavor many Lebanese dishes.\n\n\n=== Beverages ===\n\nArabic coffee, black coffee and Turkish coffee.\nLebanese beer, also contains non-alcoholic versions made with malt instead of hops.\nArak \u2013 an alcoholic beverage.\nAyran \u2013 yogurt.\nNon-alcoholic beverage made from the carob tree.\nJallab \u2013 sweet drink made from carob, dates, grape molasses and rose water.\nLebanese wine \u2013 Lebanon is among the oldest sites of wine production in the world. The Phoenicians of its coastal strip were instrumental in spreading wine and viticulture throughout the Mediterranean in ancient times. Lebanon's Beqaa Valley contains more than 30 vineyards, including the renowned Kefraya, Ksara and Ch\u00e2teau Musar labels.\nMate \u2013  a caffeine-rich infused drink and is consumed frequently in Shouf and Aley. It was thought to have been brought from Argentina by immigrants in the Lebanese diaspora returning home, where its important ingredients are grown.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nLevantine cuisine\nMiddle Eastern cuisine\n\n\n== References ==", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Akawi_Cheese.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Bamya_dish_in_Ankara.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Beyrouth._Drogmans_arabs_-_Dumas_Ph._LCCN2004670418.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Cristoforo_munari-bodegon.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Djejmeshwi.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Fattoush_Ingredients.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/28/Feta_Cheese.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Fish_Sayadieh.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Flag_of_Lebanon.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Foodlogo2.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/Fruits_and_Vegetables_%28Unsplash%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/14/F%C3%A5rskalle.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Global_thinking.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Goblet_Glass_%28Banquet%29.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Halloumislice_zoom.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Jern_Toum.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Kafta_Kabab.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Kafta_Raita.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4a/Kafta_Salad.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Kafta_Serving.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Kaschkawal_Kashkaval_%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BB_Balkank%C3%A4se_Sofia_IMG_7649.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/LebanonFood2.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/LocationLebanon.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a9/Lunch_met_het_gerecht_Meze%2C_Bestanddeelnr_255-6516.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Lunch_met_het_gerecht_Meze%2C_Bestanddeelnr_255-6517.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Lunch_met_het_gerecht_Meze%2C_Bestanddeelnr_255-6518.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3c/Lunch_met_het_gerecht_Meze%2C_Bestanddeelnr_255-6520.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Mamoul_biscotti_libanesi.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Mulukhiyiwithrice.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Mutabbel.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Palestinian_Hummus_Fatteh.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/People_icon.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Sfoufs_%288280943024%29_%28cropped%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Shanklish.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Southwest_Asia.PNG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/Sumac.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Tabouleh_%283949565145%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d4/Vegetable_Market_1_%28Unsplash%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikibooks-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/%D8%AC%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%A9_%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A9.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg"], "summary": "Lebanese cuisine (Arabic: \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0637\u0628\u062e \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0646\u064a\u200e) is the culinary traditions and practices originating from Lebanon. It includes an abundance of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, fresh fish and seafood. Poultry is eaten more often than red meat, and when red meat is eaten, it is usually lamb and goat meat. It also includes copious amounts of garlic and olive oil, often seasoned with lemon juice. Chickpeas and parsley are also staples of the Lebanese diet.Well-known savoury dishes include baba ghanouj, a dip made of char-grilled eggplant; falafel, small deep-fried balls or patties made of highly spiced ground chickpeas, fava beans, or a combination of the two; and shawarma, a sandwich with marinated meat skewered and cooked on large rods. An important component of many Lebanese meals is hummus, a dip or spread made of blended chickpeas, tahini, lemon juice, and garlic, typically eaten with flatbread.A well-known dessert is baklava, which is made of layered filo (thinly rolled pastry) filled with nuts and steeped in date syrup or honey. Some desserts are specifically prepared on special occasions; for example, meghli (rice pudding dessert, spiced with anise, caraway, and cinnamon) is served to celebrate a newborn baby in the family.Arak is an anise-flavoured moonshine, and is the Lebanese national drink, usually served with a traditional convivial Lebanese meal.

Prunus amygdalus) is a species of tree native to Iran and surrounding countries but widely cultivated elsewhere. The almond is also the name of the edible and widely cultivated seed of this tree. Within the genus Prunus, it is classified with the peach in the subgenus Amygdalus, distinguished from the other subgenera by corrugations on the shell (endocarp) surrounding the seed.The fruit of the almond is a drupe, consisting of an outer hull and a hard shell with the seed, which is not a true nut, inside. Shelling almonds refers to removing the shell to reveal the seed. Almonds are sold shelled or unshelled. Blanched almonds are shelled almonds that have been treated with hot water to soften the seedcoat, which is then removed to reveal the white embryo.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\n\n=== Tree ===\nThe almond is a deciduous tree, growing 4\u201310 m (13\u201333 ft) in height, with a trunk of up to 30 cm (12 in) in diameter. The young twigs are green at first, becoming purplish where exposed to sunlight, then grey in their second year. The leaves are 8\u201313 cm (3\u20135 in) long, with a serrated margin and a 2.5 cm (1 in) petiole. The flowers are white to pale pink, 3\u20135 cm (1\u20132 in) diameter with five petals, produced singly or in pairs and appearing before the leaves in early spring. Almond grows best in Mediterranean climates with warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The optimal temperature for their growth is between 15 and 30 \u00b0C (59 and 86 \u00b0F) and the tree buds have a chilling requirement of 200 to 700 hours below 7.2 \u00b0C (45.0 \u00b0F) to break dormancy.Almonds begin bearing an economic crop in the third year after planting. Trees reach full bearing five to six years after planting. The fruit matures in the autumn, 7\u20138 months after flowering.\n\n\n=== Drupe ===\n\nThe almond fruit is 3.5\u20136 cm (1+3\u20448\u20132+3\u20448 in) long. In botanical terms, it is not a nut but a drupe. The outer covering or exocarp, fleshy in other members of Prunus such as the plum and cherry, is instead a thick, leathery, grey-green coat (with a downy exterior), called the hull. Inside the hull is a reticulated, hard, woody shell (like the outside of a peach pit) called the endocarp. Inside the shell is the edible seed, commonly called a nut. Generally, one seed is present, but occasionally two occur. After the fruit matures, the hull splits and separates from the shell, and an abscission layer forms between the stem and the fruit so that the fruit can fall from the tree.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Origin and history ==\n\nThe almond is native to Iran and surrounding countries. It was spread by humans in ancient times along the shores of the Mediterranean into northern Africa and southern Europe, and more recently transported to other parts of the world, notably California, United States. The wild form of domesticated almond grows in parts of the Levant.Selection of the sweet type from the many bitter types in the wild marked the beginning of almond domestication. It is unclear as to which wild ancestor of the almond created the domesticated species. The species Prunus fenzliana may be the most likely wild ancestor of the almond, in part because it is native to Armenia and western Azerbaijan, where it was apparently domesticated. Wild almond species were grown by early farmers, \"at first unintentionally in the garbage heaps, and later intentionally in their orchards\".Almonds were one of the earliest domesticated fruit trees, due to \"the ability of the grower to raise attractive almonds from seed. Thus, in spite of the fact that this plant does not lend itself to propagation from suckers or from cuttings, it could have been domesticated even before the introduction of grafting\". Domesticated almonds appear in the Early Bronze Age (3000\u20132000 BC), such as the archaeological sites of Numeira (Jordan), or possibly earlier. Another well-known archaeological example of the almond is the fruit found in Tutankhamun's tomb in Egypt (c. 1325 BC), probably imported from the Levant. An article on Almond tree cultivation in Spain is brought down in Ibn al-'Awwam's 12th-century agricultural work, Book on Agriculture.Of the European countries that the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh reported as cultivating almonds, Germany is the northernmost, though the domesticated form can be found as far north as Iceland.\n\n\n=== Etymology and names ===\nThe word \"almond\" comes from Old French almande or alemande, Late Latin *amandula, derived from amygdala from the Ancient Greek \u1f00\u03bc\u03c5\u03b3\u03b4\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 (amygd\u00e1l\u0113) (cf. amygdala, an almond-shaped portion of the brain). The al- in English, for the a- used in other languages may be due a confusion with the Arabic article al, the word having first dropped the a- as in the Italian form mandorla; the British pronunciation ah-mond and the modern Catalan ametlla and modern French amande show a form of the word closer to the original. Other related names of almond include Mandel or Knackmandel (German), mandorlo (Italian for the tree), mandorla (Italian for the fruit), am\u00eandoa (Portuguese), and almendro (Spanish for the tree), almendra (Spanish for the fruit). Interestingly however, in Hebrew, the word for almond (\u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05e7\u05b5\u05d3, pronounced shak-ed) is also the word for tonsil.\nThe adjective \"amygdaloid\" (literally \"like an almond\") is used to describe objects which are roughly almond-shaped, particularly a shape which is part way between a triangle and an ellipse. See, for example, the brain structure amygdala, which uses a direct borrowing of the Greek term amygdal\u0113.\n\n\n== Cultivation ==\n\n\n=== Pollination ===\nThe pollination of California's almonds is the largest annual managed pollination event in the world, with 1.4 million hives (nearly half of all beehives in the US) being trucked in February to the almond orchards. Much of the pollination is managed by pollination brokers, who contract with migratory beekeepers from at least 49 states for the event. This business has been heavily affected by colony collapse disorder, causing nationwide shortages of honey bees and increasing the price of insect pollination. To partially protect almond growers from the rising cost of insect pollination, researchers at the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) have developed a new line of self-pollinating almond trees. Self-pollinating almond trees, such as the 'Tuono', have been around for a while, but their harvest is not as desirable as the insect-pollinated California 'Nonpareil' almond tree. The 'Nonpareil' tree produces large, smooth almonds and offers 60\u201365% edible kernel per nut. The Tuono has thicker, hairier shells and offers only 32% of edible kernel per nut, but having a thick shell has advantages. The Tuono's shell protects the nut from threatening pests such as the navel orangeworm. ARS researchers have managed to crossbreed the pest-resistant Tuono tree with the Nonpareil, resulting in hybridized cultivars of almond trees that are self-pollinated and maintain a high nut quality. The new, self-pollinating hybrids possess quality skin color, flavor, and oil content, and reduce almond growers' dependency on insect pollination.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Diseases ===\n\nAlmond trees can be attacked by an array of damaging organisms, including insects, fungal pathogens, plant viruses, and bacteria.\n\n\n== Sustainability ==\nAlmond production in California is concentrated mainly in the Central Valley, where the mild climate, rich soil, abundant sunshine and water supply make for ideal growing conditions. Due to the persistent droughts in California in the early 21st century, it became more difficult to raise almonds in a sustainable manner. The issue is complex because of the high amount of water needed to produce almonds: a single almond requires roughly 1.1 US gallons (0.92 imperial gallons; 4.2 litres) of water to grow properly.\n\nSustainability strategies implemented by the Almond Board of California and almond farmers include:\ntree and soil health, and other farming practices\nminimizing dust production during the harvest\nbee health\nirrigation guidelines for farmers\nfood safety\nuse of waste biomass as coproducts with a goal to achieve zero waste\nuse of solar energy during processing\njob development\nsupport of scientific research to investigate potential health benefits of consuming almonds\ninternational education about sustainability practices\n\n\n== Production ==\nIn 2018, world production of almonds grew by 45% over the 2017 volume to 3.2 million tonnes, with the United States providing 59% of the world total. As other leading producers, Spain, Iran, and Morocco combined contributed 18% of the world total (table).\n\n\n=== United States ===\nIn the United States, production is concentrated in California where 1,000,000 acres (400,000 ha) and six different almond varieties were under cultivation in 2017, with a yield of 2.25 billion lb (1.02 billion kg) of shelled almonds. California production is marked by a period of intense pollination during late winter by rented commercial bees transported by truck across the United States to almond groves, requiring more than half of the total US honeybee population. The value of total US exports of shelled almonds in 2016 was $3.2 billion.\n\n\n=== Spain ===\nSpain has diverse commercial cultivars of almonds grown in Catalonia, Valencia, Murcia, Andalusia, and Arag\u00f3n regions, and the Balearic Islands. Production in 2016 declined 2% nationally compared to 2015 production data.The 'Marcona' almond cultivar is recognizably different from other almonds and is marketed by name. The kernel is short, round, relatively sweet, and delicate in texture. Its origin is unknown and has been grown in Spain for a long time; the tree is very productive, and the shell of the nut is very hard.\n\n\n=== Australia ===\nAustralia is the largest almond production region in the Southern Hemisphere. Most of the almond orchards are located along the Murray River corridor in New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia.\n\n\n== Sweet and bitter almonds ==\n\nThe seeds of Prunus dulcis var. dulcis are predominantly sweet but some individual trees produce seeds that are somewhat more bitter. The genetic basis for bitterness involves a single gene, the bitter flavor furthermore being recessive, both aspects making this trait easier to domesticate. The fruits from Prunus dulcis var. amara are always bitter, as are the kernels from other species of genus Prunus, such as apricot, peach and cherry (although to a lesser extent).\n\n\n=== Amygdalin and cyanide ===\nThe bitter almond is slightly broader and shorter than the sweet almond and contains about 50% of the fixed oil that occurs in sweet almonds. It also contains the enzyme emulsin which, in the presence of water, acts on the two soluble glucosides amygdalin and prunasin yielding glucose, cyanide and the essential oil of bitter almonds, which is nearly pure benzaldehyde, the chemical causing the bitter flavor. Bitter almonds may yield 4\u20139 mg of hydrogen cyanide per almond and contain 42 times higher amounts of cyanide than the trace levels found in sweet almonds. The origin of cyanide content in bitter almonds is via the enzymatic hydrolysis of amygdalin. P450 monooxygenases are involved in the amygdalin biosynthetic pathway. A point mutation in a bHLH transcription factor prevents transcription of the two cytochrome P450 genes, resulting in the sweet kernel trait.Extract of bitter almond was once used medicinally but even in small doses, effects are severe or lethal, especially in children; the cyanide must be removed before consumption. The acute oral lethal dose of cyanide for adult humans is reported to be 0.5\u20133.5 mg/kg (0.2\u20131.6 mg/lb) of body weight (approximately 50 bitter almonds), whereas for children, consuming 5\u201310 bitter almonds may be fatal.All commercially grown almonds sold as food in the United States are sweet cultivars. The US Food and Drug Administration reported in 2010 that some fractions of imported sweet almonds were contaminated with bitter almonds. Eating such almonds could result in vertigo and other typical bitter almond (cyanide) poisoning effects.\n\n\n== Culinary uses ==\n\nWhile the almond is often eaten on its own, raw or toasted, it is also a component of various dishes. Almonds are available in many forms, such as whole, slivered, and ground into flour. Almond pieces around 2\u20133 mm in size, called \"nibs\", are used for special purposes such as decoration.Almonds are a common addition to breakfast muesli or oatmeal.\n\n\n=== Use in desserts ===\n\nA wide range of classic sweets feature almonds as a central ingredient. Since the 19th century almonds have been used to make bread, almond butter, cakes and puddings, candied confections, almond cream-filled pastries, nougat,  cookies (macaroons, biscotti and qurabiya), and cakes (financiers, Esterh\u00e1zy torte), and other sweets and desserts.The young, developing fruit of the almond tree can be eaten whole (green almonds) when they are still green and fleshy on the outside and the inner shell has not yet hardened. The fruit is somewhat sour, but is a popular snack in parts of the Middle East, eaten dipped in salt to balance the sour taste. Also in the Middle East they are often eaten with dates. They are available only from mid-April to mid-June in the Northern Hemisphere; pickling or brining extends the fruit's shelf life.\n\n\n=== World cuisines ===\nIn French cuisine, alternating layers of almond and hazelnut meringue are used to make the dessert dacquoise. Pithivier is one of many almond cream-filled pastries.\nIn Germany, Easter bread called Deutsches Osterbrot is baked with raisins and almonds.\nIn Greece almond flour is used to make amygdalopita, a glyka tapsiou dessert cake baking in a tray. Almonds are used for kourabiedes, a Greek version of the traditional quarabiya almond biscuits. A soft drink known as soumada is made from almonds in various regions.\nIn Saudi Arabia, almonds are a typical embellishment for the rice dish kabsa.\nIn Iran, green almonds are dipped in sea salt and eaten as snacks on street markets; they are called chaqale b\u00e2dam. Candied almonds called noghl are served alongside tea and coffee. Also, sweet almonds are used to prepare special food for babies, named harire badam. Almonds are added to some foods, cookies, and desserts, or are used to decorate foods. People in Iran consume roasted nuts for special events, for example, during New Year (Nowruz) parties.\nIn Italy, colomba di Pasqua is a traditional Easter cake made with almonds. Bitter almonds are the base for amaretticookies. a common dessert. Almonds are also a common choice as the nuts to include in torrone.\nIn Morocco, almonds in the form of sweet almond paste are the main ingredient in pastry fillings, and several other desserts. Fried blanched whole almonds are also used to decorate sweet tajines such as lamb with prunes. Southwestern Berber regions of Essaouira and Souss are also known for amlou, a spread made of almond paste, argan oil, and honey. Almond paste is also mixed with toasted flour and among others, honey, olive oil or butter, anise, fennel, sesame seeds, and cinnamon to make sellou (also called zamita in Meknes or slilou in Marrakech), a sweet snack known for its long shelf life and high nutritive value.\nIn Indian cuisine, almonds are the base ingredients of pasanda-style and Mughlai curries. Badam halva is a sweet made from almonds with added coloring. Almond flakes are added to many sweets (such as sohan barfi), and are usually visible sticking to the outer surface. Almonds form the base of various drinks which are supposed to have cooling properties. Almond sherbet or sherbet-e-badaam, is a popular summer drink. Almonds are also sold as a snack with added salt.\nIn Israel almonds are used as a topping for tahini cookies or eaten as a snack.\nIn Spain Marcona almonds are usually toasted in oil and lightly salted. They are used by Spanish confectioners to prepare a sweet called turr\u00f3n.\nIn Arabian cuisine, almonds are commonly used as garnishing for Mansaf.Certain natural food stores sell \"bitter almonds\" or \"apricot kernels\" labeled as such, requiring significant caution by consumers for how to prepare and eat these products.\n\n\n=== Marzipan ===\n\nMarzipan is used in a number of elegant cakes and desserts. Princess cake is covered by marzipan (similar to fondant), as is Battenberg cake. In Sicily, sponge cake is covered with marzipan to make cassatella di sant'Agata and cassata siciliana, and marzipan is dyed and crafted into realistic fruit shaped to make frutta martorana. The Andalusian Christmas pastry pan de C\u00e1diz is filled with marzipan and candied fruit.\n\n\n=== Almond milk ===\n\nAlmonds can be processed into a milk substitute called almond milk; the nut's soft texture, mild flavor, and light coloring (when skinned) make for an efficient analog to dairy, and a soy-free choice for lactose intolerant people and vegans. Raw, blanched, and lightly toasted almonds work well for different production techniques, some of which are similar to that of soymilk and some of which use no heat, resulting in \"raw milk\" (see raw foodism).\nAlmond milk, along with almond butter and almond oil, are a versatile products used in both sweet and savoury dishes.\nIn Moroccan cuisine, sharbat billooz is one of the best known beverages, served for weddings, it is made by blending blanched almonds with milk, sugar and other flavorings.\n\n\n=== Almond flour and skins ===\nAlmond flour or ground almond meal combined with sugar or honey as marzipan is often used as a gluten-free alternative to wheat flour in cooking and baking.Almonds contain polyphenols in their skins consisting of flavonols, flavan-3-ols, hydroxybenzoic acids and flavanones analogous to those of certain fruits and vegetables. These phenolic compounds and almond skin prebiotic dietary fiber have commercial interest as food additives or dietary supplements.\n\n\n=== Almond syrup ===\nHistorically, almond syrup was an emulsion of sweet and bitter almonds, usually made with barley syrup (orgeat syrup) or in a syrup of orange flower water and sugar, often flavored with a synthetic aroma of almonds. Orgeat syrup is an important ingredient in the Mai Tai and many other Tiki drinks.Due to the cyanide found in bitter almonds, modern syrups generally are produced only from sweet almonds. Such syrup products do not contain significant levels of hydrocyanic acid, so are generally considered safe for human consumption.\n\n\n== Nutrition ==\nAlmonds are 4% water, 22% carbohydrates, 21% protein, and 50% fat (table). In a 100-gram (3+1\u20442-ounce) reference amount, almonds supply 2,420 kilojoules (579 kilocalories) of food energy. The almond is a nutritionally dense food (table), providing a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of the B vitamins riboflavin and niacin, vitamin E, and the essential minerals calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, and zinc. Almonds are a moderate source (10\u201319% DV) of the B vitamins thiamine, vitamin B6, and folate, choline, and the essential mineral potassium. They also contain substantial dietary fiber, the monounsaturated fat, oleic acid, and the polyunsaturated fat, linoleic acid. Typical of nuts and seeds, almonds are a source of phytosterols such as beta-sitosterol, stigmasterol, campesterol, sitostanol, and campestanol.\n\n\n=== Health ===\nAlmonds are included as a good source of protein among recommended healthy foods by the US Department of Agriculture. A 2016 review of clinical research indicated that regular consumption of almonds may reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering blood levels of LDL cholesterol.\n\n\n=== Potential allergy ===\nAlmonds may cause allergy or intolerance. Cross-reactivity is common with peach allergens (lipid transfer proteins) and tree nut allergens. Symptoms range from local signs and symptoms (e.g., oral allergy syndrome, contact urticaria) to systemic signs and symptoms including anaphylaxis (e.g., urticaria, angioedema, gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms).\n\n\n== Oils ==\n\nAlmonds are a rich source of oil, with 50% of kernel dry mass as fat (whole almond nutrition table). In relation to total dry mass of the kernel, almond oil contains 32% monounsaturated oleic acid (an omega-9 fatty acid), 13% linoleic acid (a polyunsaturated omega-6 essential fatty acid), and 10% saturated fatty acid (mainly as palmitic acid, USDA link in table). Linolenic acid, a polyunsaturated omega-3 fat, is not present (table). Almond oil is a rich source of vitamin E, providing 261% of the Daily Value per 100 ml (table).\nWhen almond oil is analyzed separately and expressed per 100 grams as a reference mass, the oil provides 3,700 kJ (884 kcal) of food energy, 8 grams of saturated fat (81% of which is palmitic acid), 70 grams of oleic acid, and 17 grams of linoleic acid (oil table).\nOleum amygdalae, the fixed oil, is prepared from either sweet or bitter almonds, and is a glyceryl oleate with a slight odour and a nutty taste. It is almost insoluble in alcohol but readily soluble in chloroform or ether. Almond oil is obtained from the dried kernel of almonds.\n\n\n== Aflatoxins ==\nAlmonds are susceptible to aflatoxin-producing molds. Aflatoxins are potent carcinogenic chemicals produced by molds such as Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. The mold contamination may occur from soil, previously infested almonds, and almond pests such as navel-orange worm. High levels of mold growth typically appear as gray to black filament like growth. It is unsafe to eat mold-infected tree nuts.\nSome countries have strict limits on allowable levels of aflatoxin contamination of almonds and require adequate testing before the nuts can be marketed to their citizens. The European Union, for example, introduced a requirement since 2007 that all almond shipments to EU be tested for aflatoxin. If aflatoxin does not meet the strict safety regulations, the entire consignment may be reprocessed to eliminate the aflatoxin or it must be destroyed.\n\n\n== Mandatory pasteurization in California ==\nThe USDA approved a proposal by the Almond Board of California to pasteurize almonds sold to the public, after tracing cases of salmonellosis to almonds. The almond pasteurization program became mandatory for California companies in 2007. Raw, untreated California almonds have not been available in the U.S. since then.\nCalifornia almonds labeled \"raw\" must be steam-pasteurized or chemically treated with propylene oxide (PPO). This does not apply to imported almonds or almonds sold from the grower directly to the consumer in small quantities. The treatment also is not required for raw almonds sold for export outside of North America.\nThe Almond Board of California states: \"PPO residue dissipates after treatment\". The U.S. EPA has reported: \"Propylene oxide has been detected in fumigated food products; consumption of contaminated food is another possible route of exposure\". PPO is classified as Group 2B (\"possibly carcinogenic to humans\").The USDA-approved marketing order was challenged in court by organic farmers organized by the Cornucopia Institute, a Wisconsin-based farm policy research group. According to the Cornucopia Institute, this almond marketing order has imposed significant financial burdens on small-scale and organic growers and damaged domestic almond markets. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in the spring of 2009 on procedural grounds. In August 2010, a federal appeals court ruled that the farmers have a right to appeal the USDA regulation. In March 2013, the court vacated the suit on the basis that the objections should have been raised in 2007 when the regulation was first proposed.\n\n\n== Cultural aspects ==\nThe almond is highly revered in some cultures. The tree originated in the Middle East, and is mentioned numerous times in the Bible.\nIn the Hebrew Bible, the almond was a symbol of watchfulness and promise due to its early flowering. In the Bible the almond is mentioned ten times, beginning with Book of Genesis 43:11, where it is described as \"among the best of fruits\". In Numbers 17 Levi is chosen from the other tribes of Israel by Aaron's rod, which brought forth almond flowers. According to tradition, the rod of Aaron bore sweet almonds on one side and bitter on the other; if the Israelites followed the Lord, the sweet almonds would be ripe and edible, but if they were to forsake the path of the Lord, the bitter almonds would predominate. The almond blossom supplied a model for the menorah which stood in the Holy Temple, \"Three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, were on one branch, with a knob and a flower; and three cups, shaped like almond blossoms, were on the other...on the candlestick itself were four cups, shaped like almond blossoms, with its knobs and flowers\"  (Exodus 25:33\u201334; 37:19\u201320). Many Sephardic Jews give 5 almonds to each guest before special occasions like weddings.Similarly, Christian symbolism often uses almond branches as a symbol of the Virgin Birth of Jesus; paintings and icons often include almond-shaped haloes encircling the Christ Child and as a symbol of Mary. The word \"Luz\", which appears in Genesis 30:37, sometimes translated as \"hazel\", may actually be derived from the Aramaic name for almond (Luz), and is translated as such in some Bible versions such as the NIV. The Arabic name for almond is \u0644\u0648\u0632 \"lauz\" or \"l\u016bz\". In some parts of the Levant and North Africa it is pronounced \"loz\", which is very close to its Aramaic origin.\nLa entrada de la flor is an event celebrated on 1 February in Torrent, Spain, in which the clavarios and members of the Confrerie of the Mother of God deliver a branch of the first-blooming almond-tree to the Virgin.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFruit tree forms\nFruit tree propagation\nFruit tree pruning\nList of almond dishes\nList of edible seeds\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nUniversity of California Fruit and Nut Research and Information Center", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/AlmondShakerbeforeafter.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Almond_blossom02_aug_2007.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Almond_shell.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/Almond_tree_in_blossom_%28Israel%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Almond_with_two_kernels.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Almonds_-_in_shell%2C_shell_cracked_open%2C_shelled%2C_blanched.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Almondtrees.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/Ambox_globe_content.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Ametllesjuliol.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Baburnama_illustration.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/Blanched_almonds.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Colomba_pasquale%2C_edizione_2013_-_ND0_4662_%288564331585%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Flag_of_Australia_%28converted%29.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Flag_of_Iran.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Flag_of_Morocco.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Flag_of_Turkey.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a5/Flickr_-_cyclonebill_-_G%C3%A5sebryst.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Green_almonds.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Guinda-Almendras-Nata.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Kulturmandel_unreife_Fr%C3%BCchte.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Madrigueras_%2820578932389%29_%28cropped%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Mandorle_sgusciate.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Prunus_dulcis_-_K%C3%B6hler%E2%80%93s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-250.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Rose_ringed_Parakeet_in_bitter_Almond.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/SweetAlmondOil.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%85_%D9%88_%D8%B4%DA%A9%D9%88%D9%81%D9%87_%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%85.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/03/Flag_of_Italy.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9a/Flag_of_Spain.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg"], "summary": "The almond (Prunus dulcis, syn.

In Korea, the word samgyeop-sal, meaning \"pork belly\", often refers to samgyeop-sal-gui (grilled pork belly), in the same way that the word galbi, meaning \"ribs\", often refers to galbi-gui (grilled beef ribs). Gui refers to roasted, baked, or grilled dishes.\nOne can also find ogyeopsal (\uc624\uacb9\uc0b4), with an o meaning \"five\". Ogyeop-sal includes the skin part of the pork belly, unlike samgyeop-sal where the skin is removed. This corresponds with the Chinese word for pork belly, w\u01d4 hu\u0101 r\u00f2u (\u4e94\u82b1\u8089) or \"five flower meat\", as the Chinese pork belly usually includes the rind.\n\n\n== Preparation ==\n\nThick, fatty slices of pork belly, sometimes with the skin left on and sometimes scored on the diagonal, are grilled on a slanted metal griddle or a gridiron at the diners' table, inset with charcoal grills or convex gas burners. Usually, diners grill the meat themselves, flipping and cutting them with tongs and scissors, and eat directly from the grill.The meat is usually neither marinated nor seasoned, although marinated samgyeopsal in flavors such as ginseng, wine, garlic, herbs, curry, doenjang, and gochujang has gained popularity since the late 2000s. Slices of garlic, onions, green chili peppers, mushrooms, and kimchi are often grilled alongside using the fat trickling from the pork belly.Common accompaniments for samgyeopsal include ssam vegetables such as lettuce, kkaennip (perilla leaves), ssammu (pickled radish paper) and dipping sauces such as ssamjang (made with seasoned mixture of chili paste and soy bean paste) and gireum-jang (made with sesame oil, salt, and black pepper), jangajji (soy sauce-pickled vegetables) such as myeongi-jangajji (pickled Siberian onion leaves) or yangpa-jangajji (pickled onions), kimchi, as well as sliced garlic, onions, and seasoned shredded scallions. Garlic, onions, and kimchi can be either grilled with the meat or consumed raw with the cooked meat. Mushrooms, such as button mushrooms or oyster mushrooms, are also grilled with the meat.\n\n\n== Consumption ==\nGrilled meat is placed on fresh and/or pickled leaves of vegetables, with some ssamjang, and rolled up to make ssam (wrap) which is eaten in one mouthful. Any combination of accompaniments mentioned above can be added to the roll according to preference, most popularly sliced garlic.Cooked rice, stews such as kimchi-jjigae and doenjang-jjigae, as well as naengmyeon (cold noodles), can be served as meals. Sometimes, leftover meat is mixed with rice, gim-garu (seaweed flakes), and seasonings to make bokkeum-bap (fried rice) at the end.\nSamgyeopsal is often accompanied by, or accompanying (as anju) shots of soju. Somaek, a simple cocktail made by dumping a shot of soju into a glass of beer, is also a popular beverage consumed with samgyeopasal.\n\n\n== Popularity ==\n\nIn South Korea, the third day of March is \"Samgyeopsal Day\", due to samgyeopsal's three-layered composition.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBacon \u2013 A type of salt-cured pork\nKorean barbecue \u2013 style of food preparation in Korean cuisine\nList of pork dishes \u2013 Wikipedia list article\n\n\n== References ==", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Bacon_%281%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Foodlogo2.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/Korean_barbeque-Samgyeopsal-05.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Samgyeopsal-gui.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Samgyeopsal_%28pork_belly%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikibooks-logo-en-noslogan.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg"], "summary": "Samgyeopsal (\uc0bc\uacb9\uc0b4, \u4e09--, lit.\u2009'three-layer meat'), samgyeopsal-gui (\uc0bc\uacb9\uc0b4\uad6c\uc774), or grilled pork belly is a type of gui (grilled dish) in Korean cuisine."}}, "#render": {"_": "<html hidden><meta charset=utf-8></html><script src=/render.js></script></html>", "css": "/styles.css"}}
