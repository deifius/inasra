"An object file is a computer file containing object code, that is, machine code output of an assembler or compiler. The object code is usually relocatable, and not usually directly executable. There are various formats for object files, and the same machine code can be packaged in different object file formats. An object file may also work like a shared library.\nIn addition to the object code itself, object files may contain metadata used for linking or debugging, including: information to resolve symbolic cross-references between different modules, relocation information, stack unwinding information, comments, program symbols, debugging or profiling information.\n\nThe term \"object program\" dates from at least the 1950s: A term in automatic programming for the machine language program produced by the machine by translating a source program written by the programmer in a language similar to algebraic notation.\nA computer programmer generates object code with a compiler. For example, under Linux the GNU Compiler Collection compiler will generate files which have a .o extension and use the ELF format. On Windows, they have a .obj extension and use the COFF format. A linker is then used to combine the object code into one executable program or library pulling in precompiled system libraries as needed. In contrast, scripts (Python or JavaScript) are interpreted and Java (programming language) programs are compiled into byte-code class files."
