"A container format (informally, sometimes called a wrapper) is a file format that allows multiple data streams to be embedded into a single file, usually along with metadata for identifying and further detailing those streams.  Notable examples of container formats include archive files (such as the ZIP format) and formats used for multimedia playback (such as Matroska, MP4, and AVI). Among the earliest cross-platform container formats were Distinguished Encoding Rules and the 1985 Interchange File Format."
