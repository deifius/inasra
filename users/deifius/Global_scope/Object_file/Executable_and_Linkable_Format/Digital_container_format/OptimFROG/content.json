"OptimFROG is a proprietary lossless audio data compression codec developed by Florin Ghido. OptimFROG is optimized for very high compression ratios at the expense of encoding and decoding speed.\n\n\n== OptimFROG DualStream ==\nOptimFROG DualStream is a lossy codec, aimed to fill the gap between perceptual coding and lossless coding as OptimFROG DualStream has an option to produce a correction file. This file can be used, in combination with the main lossy-encoded file, for lossless decoding, but not, unlike Wavpack hybrid for instance, for playback.This correction feature is also offered by MPEG-4 SLS and DTS-HD Master Audio.\n\n\n== Technical details ==\n\n\n=== Metadata ===\nBoth OptimFROG file formats use APEv2 tags to store the metadata.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nOptimFROG at Hydrogenaudio Wiki."
