First published in the specification for the application binary interface (ABI) of the Unix operating system version named System V Release 4 (SVR4), and later in the Tool Interface Standard, it was quickly accepted among different vendors of Unix systems. In 1999, it was chosen as the standard binary file format for Unix and Unix-like systems on x86 processors by the 86open project.\nBy design, the ELF format is flexible, extensible, and cross-platform. For instance it supports different endiannesses and address sizes so it does not exclude any particular central processing unit (CPU) or instruction set architecture. This has allowed it to be adopted by many different operating systems on many different hardware platforms.\n\n\n== File layout ==\nEach ELF file is made up of one ELF header, followed by file data. The data can include:\n\nProgram header table, describing zero or more memory segments\nSection header table, describing zero or more sections\nData referred to by entries in the program header table or section header table\nThe segments contain information that is needed for run time execution of the file, while sections contain important data for linking and relocation. Any byte in the entire file can be owned by one section at most, and orphan bytes can occur which are unowned by any section.\n\n\n=== File header ===\nThe ELF header defines whether to use 32-bit or 64-bit addresses. The header contains three fields that are affected by this setting and offset other fields that follow them. The ELF header is 52 or 64 bytes long for 32-bit and 64-bit binaries respectively.\n\n\n=== Program header ===\nThe program header table tells the system how to create a process image.  It is found at file offset e_phoff, and consists of e_phnum entries, each with size e_phentsize.  The layout is slightly different in 32-bit ELF vs 64-bit ELF, because the p_flags are in a different structure location for alignment reasons.  Each entry is structured as:\n\n\n=== Section header ===\n\n\n== Tools ==\n\nreadelf is a Unix binary utility that displays information about one or more ELF files. A free software implementation is provided by GNU Binutils.\nelfutils provides alternative tools to GNU Binutils purely for Linux.\nelfdump is a command for viewing ELF information in an ELF file, available under Solaris and FreeBSD.\nobjdump provides a wide range of information about ELF files and other object formats. objdump uses the Binary File Descriptor library as a back-end to structure the ELF data.\nThe Unix file utility can display some information about ELF files, including the instruction set architecture for which the code in a relocatable, executable, or shared object file is intended, or on which an ELF core dump was produced.\n\n\n== Applications ==\n\n\n=== Unix-like systems ===\nThe ELF format has replaced older executable formats in various environments.\nIt has replaced a.out and COFF formats in Unix-like operating systems:\n\nLinux\nSolaris / Illumos\nIRIX\nFreeBSD\nNetBSD\nOpenBSD\nRedox\nDragonFly BSD\nSyllable\nHP-UX (except for 32-bit PA-RISC programs which continue to use SOM)\nQNX Neutrino\nMINIX\n\n\n=== Non-Unix adoption ===\nELF has also seen some adoption in non-Unix operating systems, such as:\n\nOpenVMS, in its Itanium and amd64 versions\nBeOS Revision 4 and later for x86 based computers (where it replaced the Portable Executable format; the PowerPC version stayed with Preferred Executable Format)\nHaiku, an open source reimplementation of BeOS\nRISC OS\nStratus VOS, in PA-RISC and x86 versions\nWindows 10 Anniversary Update using the Windows Subsystem for Linux.\nSkyOS\nFuchsia OS\nZ/TPF\nHPE NonStop OS\n Deos\n\n\n=== Game consoles ===\nSome game consoles also use ELF:\n\nPlayStation Portable, PlayStation Vita, PlayStation (console), PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5\nGP2X\nDreamcast\nGamecube\nWii\nWii U\n\n\n=== PowerPC ===\nOther (operating) systems running on PowerPC that use ELF:\n\nAmigaOS 4, the ELF executable has replaced the prior Extended Hunk Format (EHF) which was used on Amigas equipped with PPC processor expansion cards.\nMorphOS\nAROS\n\n\n=== Mobile phones ===\nSome operating systems for mobile phones and mobile devices use ELF:\n\nSymbian OS v9 uses E32Image format that is based on the ELF file format;\nSony Ericsson, for example, the W800i, W610, W300, etc.\nSiemens, the SGOLD and SGOLD2 platforms: from Siemens C65 to S75 and BenQ-Siemens E71/EL71;\nMotorola, for example, the E398, SLVR L7, v360, v3i (and all phone LTE2 which has the patch applied).\nBada, for example, the Samsung Wave S8500.\nNokia phones or tablets running the Maemo or the Meego OS, for example, the Nokia N900.\nAndroid uses ELF .so (shared object) libraries for the Java Native Interface. With Android Runtime (ART), the default since Android 5.0 \"Lollipop\", all applications are compiled into native ELF binaries on installation.\nSome phones can run ELF files through the use of a patch that adds assembly code to the main firmware, which is a feature known as ELFPack in the underground modding culture. The ELF file format is also used with the Atmel AVR (8-bit), AVR32\nand with Texas Instruments MSP430 microcontroller architectures. Some implementations of Open Firmware can also load ELF files, most notably Apple's implementation used in almost all PowerPC machines the company produced.\n\n\n== Specifications ==\n\nThe Linux Standard Base (LSB) supplements some of the above specifications for architectures in which it is specified. For example, that is the case for the System V ABI, AMD64 Supplement.\n\n\n== 86open ==\n86open was a project to form consensus on a common binary file format for Unix and Unix-like operating systems on the common PC compatible x86 architecture, to encourage software developers to port to the architecture. The initial idea was to standardize on a small subset of Spec 1170, a predecessor of the Single UNIX Specification, and the GNU C Library (glibc) to enable unmodified binaries to run on the x86 Unix-like operating systems. The project was originally designated \"Spec 150\".\nThe format eventually chosen was ELF, specifically the Linux implementation of ELF, after it had turned out to be a de facto standard supported by all involved vendors and operating systems.\nThe group began email discussions in 1997 and first met together at the Santa Cruz Operation offices on August 22, 1997.\nThe steering committee was Marc Ewing, Dion Johnson, Evan Leibovitch, Bruce Perens, Andrew Roach, Bryan Wayne Sparks and Linus Torvalds. Other people on the project were Keith Bostic, Chuck Cranor, Michael Davidson, Chris G. Demetriou, Ulrich Drepper, Don Dugger, Steve Ginzburg, Jon \"maddog\" Hall, Ron Holt, Jordan Hubbard, Dave Jensen, Kean Johnston, Andrew Josey, Robert Lipe, Bela Lubkin, Tim Marsland, Greg Page, Ronald Joe Record, Tim Ruckle, Joel Silverstein, Chia-pi Tien, and Erik Troan. Operating systems and companies represented were BeOS, BSDI, FreeBSD, Intel, Linux, NetBSD, SCO and SunSoft.\nThe project progressed and in mid-1998, SCO began developing lxrun, an open-source compatibility layer able to run Linux binaries on OpenServer, UnixWare, and Solaris. SCO announced official support of lxrun at LinuxWorld in March 1999. Sun Microsystems began officially supporting lxrun for Solaris in early 1999, and later moved to integrated support of the Linux binary format via Solaris Containers for Linux Applications.\nWith the BSDs having long supported Linux binaries (through a compatibility layer) and the main x86 Unix vendors having added support for the format, the project decided that Linux ELF was the format chosen by the industry and \"declare[d] itself dissolved\" on July 25, 1999.\n\n\n== FatELF: universal binaries for Linux ==\nFatELF is an ELF binary-format extension that adds fat binary capabilities. It is aimed for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. Additionally to the CPU architecture abstraction (byte order, word size, CPU instruction set etc.), there is the potential advantage of software-platform abstraction e.g., binaries which support multiple kernel ABI versions. As of 2 March 2021, FatELF has not been integrated into the mainline Linux Kernel.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nApplication binary interface\nComparison of executable file formats\nDWARF \u2013  a format for debugging data\nIntel Binary Compatibility Standard\nPortable Executable \u2013  format used by Windows\nvDSO \u2013  virtual DSO\nPosition-independent code\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/ELF_Executable_and_Linkable_Format_diagram_by_Ange_Albertini.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/77/Elf-layout--en.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Octicons-terminal.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg"], "summary": "In computing, the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF, formerly named Extensible Linking Format), is a common standard file format for executable files, object code, shared libraries, and core dumps.

called a wrapper) is a file format that allows multiple data streams to be embedded into a single file, usually along with metadata for identifying and further detailing those streams.  Notable examples of container formats include archive files (such as the ZIP format) and formats used for multimedia playback (such as Matroska, MP4, and AVI). Among the earliest cross-platform container formats were Distinguished Encoding Rules and the 1985 Interchange File Format.\n\n\n== Design ==\nAlthough containers may identify how data or metadata is encoded, they do not actually provide instructions about how to decode that data. A program that can open a container must also use an appropriate codec to decode its contents. If the program doesn't have the required algorithm, it can't use the contained data. In these cases, programs usually emit an error message that complains of a missing codec, which users may be able to acquire.\nContainer formats can be made to wrap any kind of data. Though there are some examples of such file formats (e.g. Microsoft Windows's DLL files), most container formats are specialized for specific data requirements. For example, since audio and video streams can be coded and decoded with many different algorithms, a container format may be used to provide the appearance of a single file format to users of multimedia playback software.\n\n\n=== Considerations ===\nThe differences between various container formats arise from five main issues:\n\nPopularity; how widely supported a container is.\nOverhead.  This is the difference in file-size between two files with the same content in a different container.\nSupport for advanced codec functionality.  Older formats such as AVI do not support new codec features like B-frames, VBR audio or VFR video natively. The format may be \"hacked\" to add support, but this creates compatibility problems.\nSupport for advanced content, such as chapters, subtitles, meta-tags, user-data.\nSupport of streaming media.\n\n\n=== Single coding formats ===\nIn addition to pure container formats, which specify only the wrapper but not the coding, a number of file formats specify both a storage layer and the coding, as part of modular design and forward compatibility.\nExamples include JPEG File Interchange Format (JFIF) for containing JPEG data, and Portable Network Graphics (PNG).\nIn principle, coding can be changed while the storage layer is retained; for example, Multiple-image Network Graphics (MNG) uses the PNG container format but provides animation, while JPEG Network Graphics (JNG) puts JPEG encoded data in a PNG container; in both cases however, the different formats have different magic numbers \u2013 the format specifies the coding, though a MNG can contain both PNG-encoded images and JPEG-encoded images.\n\n\n== Multimedia container formats ==\n\nThe container file is used to identify and interleave different data types. Simpler container formats can contain different types of audio formats, while more advanced container formats can support multiple audio and video streams, subtitles, chapter-information, and meta-data (tags) \u2014 along with the synchronization information needed to play back the various streams together. In most cases, the file header, most of the metadata and the synchro chunks are specified by the container format. For example, container formats exist for optimized, low-quality, internet video streaming which differs from high-quality Blu-ray streaming requirements.\nContainer format parts have various names: \"chunks\" as in RIFF and PNG, \"atoms\" in QuickTime/MP4, \"packets\" in MPEG-TS (from the communications term), and \"segments\" in JPEG. The main content of a chunk is called the \"data\" or \"payload\". Most container formats have chunks in sequence, each with a header, while TIFF instead stores offsets.  Modular chunks make it easy to recover other chunks in case of file corruption or dropped frames or bit slip, while offsets result in framing errors in cases of bit slip.\nSome containers are exclusive to audio:\n\nAIFF (IFF file format, widely used on Mac OS platform)\nWAV  (RIFF file format, widely used on Windows platform)\nXMF (Extensible Music Format)Other containers are exclusive to still images:\n\nFITS (Flexible Image Transport System) still images, raw data, and associated metadata.\nTIFF (Tagged Image File Format) still images and associated metadata.Other flexible containers can hold many types of audio and video, as well as other media. The most popular multi-media containers are:\n\n3GP (used by many mobile phones; based on the ISO base media file format)\nASF (container for Microsoft WMA and WMV, which today usually do not use a container)\nAVI (the standard Microsoft Windows container, also based on RIFF)\nDVR-MS (\"Microsoft Digital Video Recording\", proprietary video container format developed by Microsoft based on ASF)\nFlash Video (FLV, F4V) (container for video and audio from Adobe Systems)\nIFF (first platform-independent container format)\nMatroska (MKV) (not limited to any coding format, as it can hold virtually anything; it is an open standard container format)\nMJ2 - Motion JPEG 2000 file format, based on the ISO base media file format which is defined in MPEG-4 Part 12 and JPEG 2000 Part 12\nQuickTime File Format (standard QuickTime video container from Apple Inc.)\nMPEG program stream (standard container for MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 elementary streams on reasonably reliable media such as disks; used also on DVD-Video discs)\nMPEG-2 transport stream (a.k.a. MPEG-TS) (standard container for digital broadcasting and for transportation over unreliable media; used also on Blu-ray Disc video; typically contains multiple video and audio streams, and an electronic program guide)\nMP4 (standard audio and video container for the MPEG-4 multimedia portfolio, based on the ISO base media file format defined in MPEG-4 Part 12 and JPEG 2000 Part 12) which in turn was based on the QuickTime file format.\nOgg (standard container for Xiph.org audio formats Vorbis and Opus and video format Theora)\nRM (RealMedia; standard container for RealVideo and RealAudio)There are many other container formats, such as NUT, MXF, GXF, ratDVD, SVI, VOB and DivX Media Format\n\n\n== See also ==\nArchive format\nComparison of audio coding formats\nComparison of video codecs\nComparison of video container formats\nList of codecs\nList of open-source codecs\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOnline Video File Format Identification Tool - Designed primarily for CCTV video formats and codecs", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Ambox_question.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg"], "summary": "A container format (informally, sometimes called a wrapper) is a file format that allows multiple data streams to be embedded into a single file, usually along with metadata for identifying and further detailing those streams.
