"The euglenozoa are a large group of flagellate Excavata. They include a variety of common free-living species, as well as a few important parasites, some of which infect humans. There are two main subgroups, the euglenids and kinetoplastids. Euglenozoa are unicellular, mostly around 15\u201340 \u03bcm (0.00059\u20130.00157 in) in size, although some euglenids get up to 500 \u03bcm (0.020 in) long.\n\n"
