According to Hephaestion it was known as the Ionicos because it was used by the Ionians of Asia Minor; and it was also known as the Persicos and was associated with Persian poetry. Like the choriamb, in Greek quantitative verse the ionic never appears in passages meant to be spoken rather than sung. \"Ionics\" may refer inclusively to poetry composed of the various metrical units of the same total quantitative length (six morae) that may be used in combination with ionics proper: ionics, choriambs, and anaclasts. Equivalent forms exist in English poetry and in classical Persian poetry.\n\n\n== Examples of ionics ==\nPure examples of Ionic metrical structures occur in verse by Alcman (frg. 46 PMG = 34 D), Sappho (frg. 134-135 LP), Alcaeus (frg. 10B LP), Anacreon, and the Greek dramatists, including the first choral song of Aeschylus' Persians and in Euripides' Bacchae. Like dochmiacs, the ionic meter is characteristically experienced as expressing excitability. The form has been linked tentatively with the worship of Cybele and Dionysus.An example of pure ionics in Latin poetry is found as a \"metrical experiment\" in the Odes of Horace, Book 3, poem 12, which draws on Archilochus and Sappho for its content and utilizes a metrical line that appears in a fragment of Alcaeus. The Horace poem begins as follows:\n\nMiserarum (e)st nequ(e) amori dare ludum neque dulci\n   mala vino laver(e) aut exanimari\n   metuentis patruae verbera linguae.u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013\n    u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013\n    u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013\"Those girls are wretched who do not play with love or use sweet\n   wine to wash away their sorrows, or who are terrified,\n   fearing the blows of an uncle's tongue.\"In writing this 4-verse poem Horace tends to place a caesura (word-break) after every metrical foot, except occasionally in the last two feet of the line.\n\n\n== Anacreontics ==\nThe anacreontic | u u \u2013 u \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | is sometimes analyzed as a form of ionics which has undergone anaclasis (substitution of u \u2013 for \u2013 u in the 4th and 5th positions). The galliambic is a variation of this, with resolution (substitution of u u for \u2013 ) and catalexis (omission of the final syllable) in the second half. Catullus used galliambic meter for his Carmen 63 on the mythological figure Attis, a portion of which is spoken in the person of Cybele. The poem begins:\n\nSuper alta vectus Attis celeri rate maria\nPhrygi(um) ut nemus citato cupide pede tetigit\nadiitqu(e) opaca silvis redimita loca deae,\nstimulatus ibi furenti rabie, vagus animis\ndevolsit il(i) acuto sibi pondera silice.The meter is:\n\nu u \u2013 u \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 u u u u \u2013\nu u \u2013 u \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 u u u u \u2013\nu u \u2013 u \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 u u u u \u2013\nu u \u2013 u u u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 u u u u \u2013\n\u2013 \u2013 u \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 u u u u \u2013\"Attis, having crossed the high seas in a swift ship,\nas soon as he eagerly touched the Phrygian forest with swift foot\nand approached the shady places, surrounded by woods, of the goddess,\nexcited there by raging madness, losing his mind,\nhe tore off the weights of his groin with a sharp flint.\"In this poem Catullus leaves a caesura (word-break) at the mid-point of every line. Occasionally the 5th syllable is resolved into two shorts (as in line 4 above) or the first two shorts are replaced with a single long syllable (as in line 5, if the text is sound).\n\n\n== Ionic a minore and a maiore ==\nThe \"ionic\" almost invariably refers to the basic metron u u \u2014 \u2014, but this metron is also known by the fuller name ionic a minore in distinction to the rarely used ionic a maiore (\u2014 \u2014 u u).  Modern metricians generally consider the term ionic a maiore to be of little analytic use, a vestige of Hephaestion's \"misunderstanding of metre\" and desire to balance metrical units with their mirror images.\n\n\n== Polyschematist sequences ==\nThe Ionic and Aeolic meters are closely related, as evidenced by the polyschematist unit x x \u2014 x \u2014 u u \u2014 (with x representing an anceps position that may be heavy or light).The sotadeion, named for the Hellenistic poet Sotades, has been classified as ionic a maiore by Hephaestion and by M. L. West:\n\u2013 \u2013 u u \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | \u2013 \u2013 u u \u2013 \u2013It \"enjoyed a considerable vogue for several centuries, being associated with low-class entertainment, especially of a salacious sort, though also used for moralizing and other serious verse.\"  Among those poets who adopted it was Ennius.\n\n\n== In English ==\nIn English poetry, Edward Fitzgerald composed in a combination of anacreontics and ionics. An example of English ionics occurs in lines 4 and 5 of the following lyric stanza by Thomas Hardy:\n\nThe pair seemed lovers, yet absorbed\nIn mental scenes no longer orbed\nBy love's young rays. Each countenance\n\u00c0s \u00ect sl\u00f3wl\u00fd, \u00e0s \u00ect s\u00e1dl\u00fd\nCa\u00f9ght th\u00e8 l\u00e1mpl\u00edght's y\u00e8ll\u00f2w gl\u00e1nce,\nHeld in suspense a misery\nAt things which had been or might be.Compare W. B. Yeats, \"And the white breast of the dim sea\" (\"Who will go drive with Fergus now?\" from The Countess Cathleen) and Tennyson, \"In Memoriam,\" \"When the blood creeps and the nerves prick\" (compare pyrrhic).\n\n\n== Persian poetry ==\n\nThe ionic rhythm is common in classical Persian poetry and exists in both trimeter and tetrameter versions. Nearly 10% of lyric poems are written in the following metre:\nx u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013The acatalectic tetrameter is less common, but is also found:\n\nx u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 \u2013In these two metres the opening breve may become long, and (in the catalectic version) the final pair of shorts can be replaced by a long.\nAnaclastic versions of the metre also exist, resembling the Greek anacreontic, for example:\n\nu u \u2013 u \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013 | u u \u2013 u \u2013 u \u2013 \u2013\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIonics, in Erling B.
