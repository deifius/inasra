"X Reality (XR or Cross Reality)\nis defined as: a form of \u201cmixed reality environment that comes from the fusion (union) of ... ubiquitous sensor/actuator networks and shared  online virtual worlds....\u201d.\nIt encompasses a wide spectrum of hardware and software, including sensory interfaces, applications, and infrastructures, that enable content creation for virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), cinematic reality (CR). With these tools, users generate new forms of reality by bringing digital objects into the physical world and bringing physical world objects into the digital world.\nIts meaning has more recently been broadened to include technologies of extended (\"cyborg\" or wearable) intelligence in regards to the IEEE Council on Extended Intelligence (CXI).\n\"XR\" is a far-reaching, inclusive, and flexible term. The \"X\" represents a variable that defines a continuum that can also be expanded and extended in a multivariate sense (e.g. \"XYR\" = XY Reality).XR technologies have applications in almost every industry, such as: architecture, automotive industry, sports training, real estate, mental health, medicine, health care, retail, space travel, design, engineering, interior design, television and film, media, advertising, marketing, libraries, education, news, music, and travel.\n\n"
