He is known for his red face, white dreadlocks, dinosaur-head shoulder pads and reptile feet. The name \"Flattus\" is indicative of the character's signature flatuence. His speaking mannerisms suggest a childlike intelligence and naivety.\nThe role of Flattus Maximus was played by six different people before it was retired. Dewey Rowell was the first to take the role. A sculptor, Jeffrey Rumaner, nicknamed \"Stretch\" played Flattus in the scenes to the video \"Gor-Gor\". Pete Lee played him in This Toilet Earth. Tim Harriss portrayed him during the 1998 Halloween Tour and for the recording of We Kill Everything. Zach Blair took over the role in 1999 for the recording of Violence Has Arrived. Cory Smoot took over the role in 2002 and continued to portray the character until his death on November 3, 2011. After Smoot's death, the band made the decision to officially retire the character in his honor.\n\n\n== Gwar lore ==\nVery little about Flattus Maximus is explained in Gwar lore. Even his home planet is an uncertainty; in an interview conducted during a 1997 tour, Flattus (at the time portrayed by Pete Lee) explained his hazy memory was due to his notorious pot smoking, at which point he seemed to recall a planet named Pot (made entirely of cannabis) he once called home, but he ended up destroying it by smoking the entire planet out of existence.  Although his explanation was never officially set in stone, it's one of many theories as to where Flattus really originates from. What is apparent, though, is that he is illiterate, has a slight Southern accent, and that he attributes his \"explosive guitar style\" to a strict diet of vegetarians, which also causes his infamous atomic flatulence.\nFollowing Smoot's death in 2011, the band explained the character's absence by claiming that Flattus stole Gwar's spaceship in order to return to his home planet, Planet Home.\n\n\n== Flattus' history ==\nThe first man to portray the \"armored clown\" (taken from the pre-2005 web bio) was Dewey Rowell, who played on Hell-O and Scumdogs of the Universe. He left the band shortly after the \"Tour De Scum\" tape, and before America Must Be Destroyed, Gwar's third album, was recorded. Until mid-1992, after Gwar's Phallus In Wonderland was released, the Flattus Maximus character was absent. America Must Be Destroyed had all of its guitar parts (save two solos) played by Balsac the Jaws of Death. When playing those songs live, in particular \"The Road Behind\", it was typically Balsac, not Flattus, who played the lead.\nFor the filming of Phallus in Wonderland Jeffrey Rumaner, a sculptor friend of the band, who goes by the name of \"Stretch,\" played Flattus in the few scenes in which he was featured (the video for \"Gor-Gor\" features Stretch falling off of a building, and he plays piano in \"Have You Seen Me?\").\n\nAfter a mini-tour in early 1992, Peter Lee was hired, at the recommendation of Ministry guitarist Mike Scaccia, as the new guitarist (Scaccia had turned them down to continue working with Ministry - Scaccia and Lee were both in a band together, along with future Gwar bassist Casey Orr; it was Lee who enlisted Orr in 1994). He first played on This Toilet Earth. In 1993, Lee was shot in an attempted carjacking, and was unable to film much of \"Skulhedface\" due to injuries to his stomach. He did manage to film a commercial segment with Dave Brockie, where Lee first suggested the idea of police officers (both were dressed as policemen) playing rock music. This turned into Gwar's first true spin-off band, X-Cops. One music video from that period, \"Jack The World,\" features Lee as Flattus, and he is seen wearing a colostomy bag, which he also wore during a brief tour in October 1993. Lee played on the next two albums, RagNaRok and Carnival of Chaos, and was in the films from that time frame (1995-late 1997), \"Rendezvous With RagNaRok\" and \"Dawn of the Day of the Night of the Penguins.\" In the interview segments of \"Rendezvous...,\" Flattus is seen more than any other character (the others were a paranormal investigator played by Bob Gorman, Beefcake the Mighty, Balsac the Jaws of Death and Techno Destructo), and it is here where the childlike mannerisms truly surface. Lee left in December 1997, due to his recurring stomach problems stemming from the carjacking. His leaving of Gwar also forced the dissolution of the X-Cops.\nIn 1998, there again was no Flattus for some time. When Gwar's 1998 Halloween tour came around, Michael Bishop, who was filling in for Casey Orr as Beefcake, suggested Tim Harriss (who had previously played one Gwar show twelve years prior) of his band Kepone. Harriss would remain the Flattus character through the recording of We Kill Everything.\nIn 1999, after Orr returned, and before We Kill Everything was released, Gwar auditioned several guitarists for the role of Flattus Maximus. Zach Blair won the part, and became the reptilian cro-mag guitarist. He is seen in the film \"It's Sleazy,\" and the music video for \"Fuckin' An Animal,\" the last song on We Kill Everything. In 2001, Gwar, with Blair on guitar, recorded Violence Has Arrived, from which one music video, the concert favorite \"Immortal Corrupter,\" was recorded. However, Blair was not featured in the \"Immortal Corrupter\" video, and was replaced by Tim Harriss for the video shoot.  Blair, along with Casey Orr, left after the Blood Drive 2nd Campaign Tour (the second tour for Violence Has Arrived).\nIn September 2002, a new Flattus was needed, and Cory Smoot (Mensrea/Locus Factor), who had previously auditioned in 1999, was recruited. Smoot, being a talented producer, lent his technical skills to the recording of War Party, and co-produced, as well as co-mixed with Devin Townsend (Steve Vai/Strapping Young Lad) Gwar's 2006 release, titled Beyond Hell. The two albums were recorded at Karma Studios, owned and operated by Smoot. Smoot has been the longest running Flattus thus and is in the videos for \"War Party\", \"Bring Back The Bomb\", \"Womb With A View\", \"School's Out\" and \"Eighth Lock\". Smoot is considered by Gwar fans to be the \"True Flattus\", as he is the longest serving person to portray the character in Gwar history.  Smoot also produced the follow-up to Beyond Hell, Lust in Space, along with other members of Gwar, and even sang lead vocals on the track \"Release the Flies\".  Smoot's final Gwar album, Bloody Pit of Horror, features a 12-minute epic of four songs strung together, which was largely the brainchild of Smoot.  Originally he wrote the music for a solo project of his, but by the suggestion of Dave Brockie, it was reworked to become new Gwar material.\n\n\n== Death of Cory Smoot and retirement of Flattus ==\nOn November 3, 2011, hours after a performance at First Avenue in Minneapolis, Minnesota, Smoot was found dead by his fellow band members in the band's tour bus as they prepared to cross the border into Manitoba, Canada from North Dakota. A medical examiner concluded that Smoot died from \"coronary artery thrombosis brought about by his pre-existing coronary artery disease\". On November 4, Dave Brockie officially announced that the character of Flattus Maximus would be retired out of respect to Smoot.\n\n\n== Costume evolution ==\n\nFlattus began life with a helmet with large horns, dinosaur-skull shoulder pads, a painted red face and long dreadlocks. During the 1990 Tour De Scum, Flattus' helmet changed into something resembling the horns of a ram, but this was a short-lived change. Two of Flattus' three appearances in \"Phallus In Wonderland\" used his \"Scumdogs\" helmet (the second of the three, the video for \"Have You Seen Me?,\" has him wearing a tuxedo, and no armor whatsoever). The second incarnation did away with the helmet, and the shoulder pads were enlarged. By \"RagNaRok,\" the shoulder pads were brown dinosaur heads instead of skulls, and he had a tail and loincloth (scaly and brown). His face was still red, but was a mask, and his dreadlocks were shorter and stuck out like a palm tree. His shoulder pads changed slightly for \"Carnival of Chaos,\" and would be the last change until after \"We Kill Everything\" was recorded. \"We Kill Everything\" has a photo of Flattus (presumably Michael Derks in said costume), and he is more or less the same (it is the same costume), minus the tail and taller. Blair's Flattus is the most drastic change: the shoulder pads became green (with some exposed bone and muscle, but mostly scale), the tail reappears (for the \"WKE\" photo shoot, Derks did not wear one), and, like the feet, shoulder pads and loincloth, is green and scaly. The face is less comical, and more like a bulldog (still red, though). The dreadlocks are white, and at their shortest. In the \"Fuckin' An Animal\" video, Blair's Flattus costume featured a tail, though in subsequent tours and videos it did not. Smoot's changes to the costume (to coincide with War Party) were mostly in the face and hair. The face is larger and more distorted, and the dreadlocks are white and black, and are pulled back. They are also considerably longer than before. The tail is gone. The shoulderpads are a bit larger and longer, whereas Blair's were more compact.\nBeyond Hell-era Flattus has grey shoulderpads, green feet and a slightly redesigned face. The face closer depicts a Cro-Magnon (or Gwar's take on one), which fits Flattus' current description of himself (\"It is me Flattus Maximus your reptilian/cro-mag/alien of flatulance and fury.\" Taken from his Oct. 18, 2005 blog entry), as well as the pre-historic theme of the costume.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGwar Official Website", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Flattus-maximus-05.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Flattus-maximus-06.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Flattus-maximus-07.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg"], "summary": "Flattus Maximus is the name of a character and former guitarist in the American heavy metal band Gwar.

The album is their first album on Metal Blade Records and was released on January 8, 1990. To date, it is the band's best-selling album.A deluxe 30th anniversary box set of Scumdogs was released in August 2020, with remixed and remastered audio by producer Ronan Chris Murphy, as well as an exclusive cassette containing rehearsal demos and previously unreleased tracks. Those that pre-ordered the box set received a digital download of the remastered album on August 7, 2020, with the first single, \"Maggots\", being made publicly available the same day. The remaster saw a wide release on October 30, 2020.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nAs the title implies, it is a concept album about the Scumdogs' (Gwar) reign of terror on planet Earth (the song \"Death Pod\" explains exactly how they came to Earth to begin with). The production is very refined compared to the independent, rushed first attempt (with each successive album sounding more and more refined). Gwar began to experiment with samples to some degree (e.g. in the song, \"Maggots\").  The songs are more socially relevant in this album as well. Examples include \"Slaughterama\" (which involves Gwar killing hippies and nazi-skinheads in a game show-style fashion) and the opening track, \"The Salaminizer\", in which the first verse was inspired by/based on \"Gangsta, Gangsta\", a song by the breakthrough rap group N.W.A. Other references include history (Vlad the Impaler) and Lovecraft mythology (Horror of Yig).\nMost of the album is centered on twisted jokes about insane medical practices and sexual perversion. This album is viewed by many of Gwar's fans (as well as Gwar themselves) as their ultimate masterpiece. Thus the band will play more songs from Scumdogs than any other album (\"Sick of You\" is the most frequently played song in concert, generally the grand finale).\nThis is the first Gwar album on which more than two people sing lead (Hell-O had Oderus Urungus and Techno Destructo): \"Slaughterama\" features Sleazy P. Martini, Sexecutioner sings his namesake song, and the album's CD exclusive closer, \"Cool Place To Park,\" debuts bassist Beefcake the Mighty as a vocalist. All other songs featured Oderus.\nAdditionally, Danielle Stampe (Slymenstra Hymen), Michael Derks (Balsac the Jaws of Death), Chuck Varga (Sexecutioner), and Brad Roberts (Jizmak Da Gusha) make their debuts on this album.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn 2016, Scumdogs of the Universe was ranked #90 on Loudwire's Top 90 Hard Rock + Metal Albums of the 1990s lists.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nNote\n\nThe tracks \"The Years Without Light\" and \"Cool Place to Park\" do not appear on versions released under the Master label, only versions released under Metal Blade label. For the original 1990 Metal Blade release of the album, \"Cool Place to Park\" is a CD only track.Note\n\nThe 30th anniversary track order has been changed to match the remastered vinyl release, while the pre-order download version featured the tracks numbered to match the 1990 release order. The remastered CD's track listing erroneously omits \"Sexecutioner\", with the numbering jumping from track 8 to track 10, similar to censored versions of This Toilet Earth.Note\n\nThe demo cassette contains an unlisted hidden track after \"Jellyfish\", a studio demo of \"Horror of Yig\" that was originally intended to be released through Sub Pop's Singles Club program.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nDave Brockie (Oderus Urungus) - lead vocals\nDewey Rowell (Flattus Maximus) - lead guitar, backing vocals\nMike Derks (Balsac the Jaws of Death) - rhythm guitar, backing vocals\nMichael Bishop (Beefcake the Mighty) - bass, backing vocals; lead vocals on \"Cool Place to Park\"\nBrad Roberts (Jizmak Da Gusha) - drums\nDanielle Stampe (Slymenstra Hymen) - backing vocals\nChuck Varga (Sexecutioner) -  vocals on \"Sexecutioner\"\nDon Drakulich (Sleazy P.

Stampe left Gwar in 2000 but returned for one final tour with the group in 2002.\n\n\n== Danielle Stampe ==\n\nDanielle Stampe was born in San Diego on November 27, 1967. Her family moved to Virginia Beach, Virginia where she attended high school before moving on to Virginia Commonwealth University to study Fine Art. It was there that Stampe met Dave Brockie of the band Gwar. Stampe joined Gwar in 1988 and developed the Slymenstra Hymen character. In 1992, Stampe moved to New York City. In 1995, along with Ula and Sharka of the Pain-Proof Rubber Girls, she helped in creating the Girly Freak Show, a performance troupe where she could be seen performing sideshow acts such as fire spinning and breathing, bullwhip, sword ladder walking, glass walking, eating lightbulbs, the Fiji mermaid, fire fan dance, burlesque tassle twirler, and the Miss Spidora illusion. After performing the act in clubs, it moved on to touring nationally as part of the 1996 Lollapalooza tour. After Lollapalooza, many of the performers moved on to other projects and Girly Freak Show came to an end.Stampe moved to Los Angeles in 1996 and after leaving Gwar in 2000, she revived the Girly Freak Show, for which she was granted the naming rights by Ula and Sharka. Stampe also performed her sideshow act, often under the pseudonyms Danyella De Meaux and Miss Electra, as a member of the Brothers Grim Sideshow as well as with The Velvet Hammer Burlesque and Lucha VaVOOM, the wrestling/burlesque show. During these appearances, she could often be seen performing \"Don't Need A Man\" live. Stampe holds several world records for fire breathing and human endurance of high-voltage electricity. These feats also have also resulted in her appearances on numerous television shows, including Ripley's Believe It or Not!, Guinness World Records Primetime, and Wild West Tech. She has also been a performer at Knott's Scary Farm, the annual Halloween event held at Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, California.Stampe works on set design for film and music videos, most notably for performers Lady Gaga, Katy Perry and Nicki Minaj.

The album\u2019s lyrical content was inspired by controversy over obscenity charges against the band and an incident in Charlotte, North Carolina in which frontman Dave Brockie\u2019s prosthetic penile attachment, \"The Cuttlefish of Cthulhu\", was confiscated by police officers.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe lyrical content in America Must Be Destroyed was greatly inspired by Dave Brockie\u2019s fight with police officers while touring in Charlotte, North Carolina in 1990. The controversy revolved around Brockie\u2019s rubbery penis adornment and ended with him being arrested on charges of disseminating obscenity. Brockie was revolted by this attack on his rights and so he created a concept album revolving around an elite \"Morality Squad\" that attacked the members of Gwar and stole Oderus\u2019s penile attachment (a.k.a. Cuttlefish of Cthulu, a phallic hell beast that normally dangles from his crotch). The opening song, \"Ham on the Bone\" (which has a nod to grindcore) explains this robbery. The story then shifts to Gwar headquarters in Antarctica, where Oderus\u2019s slaves are ordered to shoot up a dinosaur egg with crack. The result is the mighty Gor Gor, a Tyrannosaurus Rex that wreaks havoc on America. Meanwhile, the Morality Squad has enlisted the help of Father Bohab (a Catholic priest) to crucify Gwar in the media. Other songs of interest include \"Have You Seen Me?\", \"Poor Ole Tom\", and \"The Road Behind\", the latter of which is a parody of power ballads. A video, Phallus in Wonderland, was released as a supplement to the album\u2019s storyline. This album was followed by The Road Behind, an EP that contained that single as well as a live version of \"Have You Seen Me?\". The single \"S.F.W.\" (a staple of their live shows) was supposedly released on this album as a bonus track, but this has been discounted by the band.\nIn November of 2009, a special edition of the album was released through Metal Blade, containing the CD and a bonus DVD containing Phallus in Wonderland and Tour De Scum.\nGwar fans are referred to as \"bohabs\", named for Father Bohab (\"bohab\" literally means \"habitually boring\", which is the opposite of what Gwar and their fans are\u2014it fits Father Bohab perfectly; Gwar speaks ill of their fans\u2014to their delight\u2014and they have since taken the term as a point of pride).\nFather Bohab was never actually on the album\u2014he originally appeared in 1989, along with an early Cardinal Syn. On the Tour de Scum (the corresponding tour to Scumdogs of the Universe, the Morality Squad story is introduced. He (Bohab) is played by one of the slaves (according to Chuck Varga\u2019s Bohab Central forum posts, it was Bob Gorman; he also went on to say that the voice was his) on tour, but is portrayed by Brad Roberts (Jizmak Da Gusha) in Phallus in Wonderland and It's Sleazy.\n\"Pussy Planet\", the album\u2019s closer, was co-written by Slymenstra Hymen, and was slated to be a duet with Beefcake the Mighty. Though not quite a duet, Slymenstra\u2019s voice can still be heard in the song. The song's opening bass riff is similar to the guitar riff to the Nirvana song \"Rape Me\" from the 1993 album In Utero (\"Rape Me\" was originally written in early 1991 pre-dating \"Pussy Planet\" with the demo version being released many years on Nirvana's With the Lights Out box set) but uses different chords. The song ends with the band arguing.\nThe Canadian release of this album does not feature \"Crack in the Egg\", \"Have You Seen Me?\" and \"Rock N\u2019 Roll Never Felt So Good\", and instead has earlier versions of \"Krak Down\" and \"Bad Bad Men\" (both from This Toilet Earth) and a version of \"O Canada\" performed with synthesized infant cries (according to Gwar, this was included as a way to ridicule Canada for not having the \"guts\" to include the omitted songs).\nFlattus Maximus does not perform on this album. Dewey Rowell left the band before recording began, and all of the lead guitars (save for two songs \u2014 \"Crack in the Egg\" and the title track) were recorded by Balsac the Jaws of Death. To this day, Balsac will usually play lead when performing songs from this album live. Tim Harriss (of Kepone, the band Michael Bishop left Gwar for) played lead on the album\u2019s title track; Lee Harris (from Jizmak Da Gusha\u2019s old band Rosebud) played lead on \"Crack in the Egg\". Because of the absence of Flattus, the tour cycle surrounding this album was quite short.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nDave Brockie (Oderus Urungus) \u2013 Lead vocals\nMike Derks (Balsac the Jaws of Death) \u2013 Lead guitar, Rhythm guitar, backing vocals\nMichael Bishop (Beefcake the Mighty) \u2013 Bass, backing vocals; lead vocals on \"Pussy Planet\"\nBrad Roberts (Jizmak Da Gusha) \u2013 Drums\nDanielle Stampe (Slymenstra Hymen) \u2013 Backing vocals\nChuck Varga (Sexecutioner) \u2013 Spoken words at the end of \"Pussy Planet\"\nHunter Jackson (Edna P.

Those that pre-ordered the box set received a digital download of the remastered album on August 7, 2020, with the first single, \"Maggots\", being made publicly available the same day. The remaster saw a wide release on October 30, 2020.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nAs the title implies, it is a concept album about the Scumdogs' (Gwar) reign of terror on planet Earth (the song \"Death Pod\" explains exactly how they came to Earth to begin with). The production is very refined compared to the independent, rushed first attempt (with each successive album sounding more and more refined). Gwar began to experiment with samples to some degree (e.g. in the song, \"Maggots\").  The songs are more socially relevant in this album as well. Examples include \"Slaughterama\" (which involves Gwar killing hippies and nazi-skinheads in a game show-style fashion) and the opening track, \"The Salaminizer\", in which the first verse was inspired by/based on \"Gangsta, Gangsta\", a song by the breakthrough rap group N.W.A. Other references include history (Vlad the Impaler) and Lovecraft mythology (Horror of Yig).\nMost of the album is centered on twisted jokes about insane medical practices and sexual perversion. This album is viewed by many of Gwar's fans (as well as Gwar themselves) as their ultimate masterpiece. Thus the band will play more songs from Scumdogs than any other album (\"Sick of You\" is the most frequently played song in concert, generally the grand finale).\nThis is the first Gwar album on which more than two people sing lead (Hell-O had Oderus Urungus and Techno Destructo): \"Slaughterama\" features Sleazy P. Martini, Sexecutioner sings his namesake song, and the album's CD exclusive closer, \"Cool Place To Park,\" debuts bassist Beefcake the Mighty as a vocalist. All other songs featured Oderus.\nAdditionally, Danielle Stampe (Slymenstra Hymen), Michael Derks (Balsac the Jaws of Death), Chuck Varga (Sexecutioner), and Brad Roberts (Jizmak Da Gusha) make their debuts on this album.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn 2016, Scumdogs of the Universe was ranked #90 on Loudwire's Top 90 Hard Rock + Metal Albums of the 1990s lists.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nNote\n\nThe tracks \"The Years Without Light\" and \"Cool Place to Park\" do not appear on versions released under the Master label, only versions released under Metal Blade label. For the original 1990 Metal Blade release of the album, \"Cool Place to Park\" is a CD only track.Note\n\nThe 30th anniversary track order has been changed to match the remastered vinyl release, while the pre-order download version featured the tracks numbered to match the 1990 release order. The remastered CD's track listing erroneously omits \"Sexecutioner\", with the numbering jumping from track 8 to track 10, similar to censored versions of This Toilet Earth.Note\n\nThe demo cassette contains an unlisted hidden track after \"Jellyfish\", a studio demo of \"Horror of Yig\" that was originally intended to be released through Sub Pop's Singles Club program.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nDave Brockie (Oderus Urungus) - lead vocals\nDewey Rowell (Flattus Maximus) - lead guitar, backing vocals\nMike Derks (Balsac the Jaws of Death) - rhythm guitar, backing vocals\nMichael Bishop (Beefcake the Mighty) - bass, backing vocals; lead vocals on \"Cool Place to Park\"\nBrad Roberts (Jizmak Da Gusha) - drums\nDanielle Stampe (Slymenstra Hymen) - backing vocals\nChuck Varga (Sexecutioner) -  vocals on \"Sexecutioner\"\nDon Drakulich (Sleazy P.
