The album is their first album on Metal Blade Records and was released on January 8, 1990. To date, it is the band's best-selling album.A deluxe 30th anniversary box set of Scumdogs was released in August 2020, with remixed and remastered audio by producer Ronan Chris Murphy, as well as an exclusive cassette containing rehearsal demos and previously unreleased tracks. Those that pre-ordered the box set received a digital download of the remastered album on August 7, 2020, with the first single, \"Maggots\", being made publicly available the same day. The remaster saw a wide release on October 30, 2020.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nAs the title implies, it is a concept album about the Scumdogs' (Gwar) reign of terror on planet Earth (the song \"Death Pod\" explains exactly how they came to Earth to begin with). The production is very refined compared to the independent, rushed first attempt (with each successive album sounding more and more refined). Gwar began to experiment with samples to some degree (e.g. in the song, \"Maggots\").  The songs are more socially relevant in this album as well. Examples include \"Slaughterama\" (which involves Gwar killing hippies and nazi-skinheads in a game show-style fashion) and the opening track, \"The Salaminizer\", in which the first verse was inspired by/based on \"Gangsta, Gangsta\", a song by the breakthrough rap group N.W.A. Other references include history (Vlad the Impaler) and Lovecraft mythology (Horror of Yig).\nMost of the album is centered on twisted jokes about insane medical practices and sexual perversion. This album is viewed by many of Gwar's fans (as well as Gwar themselves) as their ultimate masterpiece. Thus the band will play more songs from Scumdogs than any other album (\"Sick of You\" is the most frequently played song in concert, generally the grand finale).\nThis is the first Gwar album on which more than two people sing lead (Hell-O had Oderus Urungus and Techno Destructo): \"Slaughterama\" features Sleazy P. Martini, Sexecutioner sings his namesake song, and the album's CD exclusive closer, \"Cool Place To Park,\" debuts bassist Beefcake the Mighty as a vocalist. All other songs featured Oderus.\nAdditionally, Danielle Stampe (Slymenstra Hymen), Michael Derks (Balsac the Jaws of Death), Chuck Varga (Sexecutioner), and Brad Roberts (Jizmak Da Gusha) make their debuts on this album.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn 2016, Scumdogs of the Universe was ranked #90 on Loudwire's Top 90 Hard Rock + Metal Albums of the 1990s lists.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nNote\n\nThe tracks \"The Years Without Light\" and \"Cool Place to Park\" do not appear on versions released under the Master label, only versions released under Metal Blade label. For the original 1990 Metal Blade release of the album, \"Cool Place to Park\" is a CD only track.Note\n\nThe 30th anniversary track order has been changed to match the remastered vinyl release, while the pre-order download version featured the tracks numbered to match the 1990 release order. The remastered CD's track listing erroneously omits \"Sexecutioner\", with the numbering jumping from track 8 to track 10, similar to censored versions of This Toilet Earth.Note\n\nThe demo cassette contains an unlisted hidden track after \"Jellyfish\", a studio demo of \"Horror of Yig\" that was originally intended to be released through Sub Pop's Singles Club program.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nDave Brockie (Oderus Urungus) - lead vocals\nDewey Rowell (Flattus Maximus) - lead guitar, backing vocals\nMike Derks (Balsac the Jaws of Death) - rhythm guitar, backing vocals\nMichael Bishop (Beefcake the Mighty) - bass, backing vocals; lead vocals on \"Cool Place to Park\"\nBrad Roberts (Jizmak Da Gusha) - drums\nDanielle Stampe (Slymenstra Hymen) - backing vocals\nChuck Varga (Sexecutioner) -  vocals on \"Sexecutioner\"\nDon Drakulich (Sleazy P.

Slymenstra and Oderus Urungus are featured in a duet titled \"Fire in the Loins,\" on the RagNaRok album. \"Don't Need A Man,\" written by Michael Derks and appearing on Carnival Of Chaos, was the first Gwar song to feature Slymenstra solo on lead vocals. \"My Girly Ways,\" featured on We Kill Everything, also featured Slymenstra in what would be the character's final song as a lead vocalist. Stampe left Gwar in 2000 but returned for one final tour with the group in 2002.\n\n\n== Danielle Stampe ==\n\nDanielle Stampe was born in San Diego on November 27, 1967. Her family moved to Virginia Beach, Virginia where she attended high school before moving on to Virginia Commonwealth University to study Fine Art. It was there that Stampe met Dave Brockie of the band Gwar. Stampe joined Gwar in 1988 and developed the Slymenstra Hymen character. In 1992, Stampe moved to New York City. In 1995, along with Ula and Sharka of the Pain-Proof Rubber Girls, she helped in creating the Girly Freak Show, a performance troupe where she could be seen performing sideshow acts such as fire spinning and breathing, bullwhip, sword ladder walking, glass walking, eating lightbulbs, the Fiji mermaid, fire fan dance, burlesque tassle twirler, and the Miss Spidora illusion. After performing the act in clubs, it moved on to touring nationally as part of the 1996 Lollapalooza tour. After Lollapalooza, many of the performers moved on to other projects and Girly Freak Show came to an end.Stampe moved to Los Angeles in 1996 and after leaving Gwar in 2000, she revived the Girly Freak Show, for which she was granted the naming rights by Ula and Sharka. Stampe also performed her sideshow act, often under the pseudonyms Danyella De Meaux and Miss Electra, as a member of the Brothers Grim Sideshow as well as with The Velvet Hammer Burlesque and Lucha VaVOOM, the wrestling/burlesque show. During these appearances, she could often be seen performing \"Don't Need A Man\" live. Stampe holds several world records for fire breathing and human endurance of high-voltage electricity. These feats also have also resulted in her appearances on numerous television shows, including Ripley's Believe It or Not!, Guinness World Records Primetime, and Wild West Tech. She has also been a performer at Knott's Scary Farm, the annual Halloween event held at Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, California.Stampe works on set design for film and music videos, most notably for performers Lady Gaga, Katy Perry and Nicki Minaj. She is also the owner of an interior and exterior home design company named Wrapt In Comfort.\n\n\n== References ==", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Slymenstra_and_fans_2003.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg"], "summary": "Slymenstra Hymen was Gwar's dancer, bodyguard, and occasional singer portrayed by Danielle Stampe.Slymenstra contributed backup vocals on most Gwar albums during her time with the band.

The album\u2019s lyrical content was inspired by controversy over obscenity charges against the band and an incident in Charlotte, North Carolina in which frontman Dave Brockie\u2019s prosthetic penile attachment, \"The Cuttlefish of Cthulhu\", was confiscated by police officers.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe lyrical content in America Must Be Destroyed was greatly inspired by Dave Brockie\u2019s fight with police officers while touring in Charlotte, North Carolina in 1990. The controversy revolved around Brockie\u2019s rubbery penis adornment and ended with him being arrested on charges of disseminating obscenity. Brockie was revolted by this attack on his rights and so he created a concept album revolving around an elite \"Morality Squad\" that attacked the members of Gwar and stole Oderus\u2019s penile attachment (a.k.a. Cuttlefish of Cthulu, a phallic hell beast that normally dangles from his crotch). The opening song, \"Ham on the Bone\" (which has a nod to grindcore) explains this robbery. The story then shifts to Gwar headquarters in Antarctica, where Oderus\u2019s slaves are ordered to shoot up a dinosaur egg with crack. The result is the mighty Gor Gor, a Tyrannosaurus Rex that wreaks havoc on America. Meanwhile, the Morality Squad has enlisted the help of Father Bohab (a Catholic priest) to crucify Gwar in the media. Other songs of interest include \"Have You Seen Me?\", \"Poor Ole Tom\", and \"The Road Behind\", the latter of which is a parody of power ballads. A video, Phallus in Wonderland, was released as a supplement to the album\u2019s storyline. This album was followed by The Road Behind, an EP that contained that single as well as a live version of \"Have You Seen Me?\". The single \"S.F.W.\" (a staple of their live shows) was supposedly released on this album as a bonus track, but this has been discounted by the band.\nIn November of 2009, a special edition of the album was released through Metal Blade, containing the CD and a bonus DVD containing Phallus in Wonderland and Tour De Scum.\nGwar fans are referred to as \"bohabs\", named for Father Bohab (\"bohab\" literally means \"habitually boring\", which is the opposite of what Gwar and their fans are\u2014it fits Father Bohab perfectly; Gwar speaks ill of their fans\u2014to their delight\u2014and they have since taken the term as a point of pride).\nFather Bohab was never actually on the album\u2014he originally appeared in 1989, along with an early Cardinal Syn. On the Tour de Scum (the corresponding tour to Scumdogs of the Universe, the Morality Squad story is introduced. He (Bohab) is played by one of the slaves (according to Chuck Varga\u2019s Bohab Central forum posts, it was Bob Gorman; he also went on to say that the voice was his) on tour, but is portrayed by Brad Roberts (Jizmak Da Gusha) in Phallus in Wonderland and It's Sleazy.\n\"Pussy Planet\", the album\u2019s closer, was co-written by Slymenstra Hymen, and was slated to be a duet with Beefcake the Mighty. Though not quite a duet, Slymenstra\u2019s voice can still be heard in the song. The song's opening bass riff is similar to the guitar riff to the Nirvana song \"Rape Me\" from the 1993 album In Utero (\"Rape Me\" was originally written in early 1991 pre-dating \"Pussy Planet\" with the demo version being released many years on Nirvana's With the Lights Out box set) but uses different chords. The song ends with the band arguing.\nThe Canadian release of this album does not feature \"Crack in the Egg\", \"Have You Seen Me?\" and \"Rock N\u2019 Roll Never Felt So Good\", and instead has earlier versions of \"Krak Down\" and \"Bad Bad Men\" (both from This Toilet Earth) and a version of \"O Canada\" performed with synthesized infant cries (according to Gwar, this was included as a way to ridicule Canada for not having the \"guts\" to include the omitted songs).\nFlattus Maximus does not perform on this album. Dewey Rowell left the band before recording began, and all of the lead guitars (save for two songs \u2014 \"Crack in the Egg\" and the title track) were recorded by Balsac the Jaws of Death. To this day, Balsac will usually play lead when performing songs from this album live. Tim Harriss (of Kepone, the band Michael Bishop left Gwar for) played lead on the album\u2019s title track; Lee Harris (from Jizmak Da Gusha\u2019s old band Rosebud) played lead on \"Crack in the Egg\". Because of the absence of Flattus, the tour cycle surrounding this album was quite short.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nDave Brockie (Oderus Urungus) \u2013 Lead vocals\nMike Derks (Balsac the Jaws of Death) \u2013 Lead guitar, Rhythm guitar, backing vocals\nMichael Bishop (Beefcake the Mighty) \u2013 Bass, backing vocals; lead vocals on \"Pussy Planet\"\nBrad Roberts (Jizmak Da Gusha) \u2013 Drums\nDanielle Stampe (Slymenstra Hymen) \u2013 Backing vocals\nChuck Varga (Sexecutioner) \u2013 Spoken words at the end of \"Pussy Planet\"\nHunter Jackson (Edna P.

The album is their first album on Metal Blade Records and was released on January 8, 1990. To date, it is the band's best-selling album.A deluxe 30th anniversary box set of Scumdogs was released in August 2020, with remixed and remastered audio by producer Ronan Chris Murphy, as well as an exclusive cassette containing rehearsal demos and previously unreleased tracks. Those that pre-ordered the box set received a digital download of the remastered album on August 7, 2020, with the first single, \"Maggots\", being made publicly available the same day. The remaster saw a wide release on October 30, 2020.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nAs the title implies, it is a concept album about the Scumdogs' (Gwar) reign of terror on planet Earth (the song \"Death Pod\" explains exactly how they came to Earth to begin with). The production is very refined compared to the independent, rushed first attempt (with each successive album sounding more and more refined). Gwar began to experiment with samples to some degree (e.g. in the song, \"Maggots\").  The songs are more socially relevant in this album as well. Examples include \"Slaughterama\" (which involves Gwar killing hippies and nazi-skinheads in a game show-style fashion) and the opening track, \"The Salaminizer\", in which the first verse was inspired by/based on \"Gangsta, Gangsta\", a song by the breakthrough rap group N.W.A. Other references include history (Vlad the Impaler) and Lovecraft mythology (Horror of Yig).\nMost of the album is centered on twisted jokes about insane medical practices and sexual perversion. This album is viewed by many of Gwar's fans (as well as Gwar themselves) as their ultimate masterpiece. Thus the band will play more songs from Scumdogs than any other album (\"Sick of You\" is the most frequently played song in concert, generally the grand finale).\nThis is the first Gwar album on which more than two people sing lead (Hell-O had Oderus Urungus and Techno Destructo): \"Slaughterama\" features Sleazy P. Martini, Sexecutioner sings his namesake song, and the album's CD exclusive closer, \"Cool Place To Park,\" debuts bassist Beefcake the Mighty as a vocalist. All other songs featured Oderus.\nAdditionally, Danielle Stampe (Slymenstra Hymen), Michael Derks (Balsac the Jaws of Death), Chuck Varga (Sexecutioner), and Brad Roberts (Jizmak Da Gusha) make their debuts on this album.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nIn 2016, Scumdogs of the Universe was ranked #90 on Loudwire's Top 90 Hard Rock + Metal Albums of the 1990s lists.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nNote\n\nThe tracks \"The Years Without Light\" and \"Cool Place to Park\" do not appear on versions released under the Master label, only versions released under Metal Blade label. For the original 1990 Metal Blade release of the album, \"Cool Place to Park\" is a CD only track.Note\n\nThe 30th anniversary track order has been changed to match the remastered vinyl release, while the pre-order download version featured the tracks numbered to match the 1990 release order. The remastered CD's track listing erroneously omits \"Sexecutioner\", with the numbering jumping from track 8 to track 10, similar to censored versions of This Toilet Earth.Note\n\nThe demo cassette contains an unlisted hidden track after \"Jellyfish\", a studio demo of \"Horror of Yig\" that was originally intended to be released through Sub Pop's Singles Club program.\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nDave Brockie (Oderus Urungus) - lead vocals\nDewey Rowell (Flattus Maximus) - lead guitar, backing vocals\nMike Derks (Balsac the Jaws of Death) - rhythm guitar, backing vocals\nMichael Bishop (Beefcake the Mighty) - bass, backing vocals; lead vocals on \"Cool Place to Park\"\nBrad Roberts (Jizmak Da Gusha) - drums\nDanielle Stampe (Slymenstra Hymen) - backing vocals\nChuck Varga (Sexecutioner) -  vocals on \"Sexecutioner\"\nDon Drakulich (Sleazy P.
