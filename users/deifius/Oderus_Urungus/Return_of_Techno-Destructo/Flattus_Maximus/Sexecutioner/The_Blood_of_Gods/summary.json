It is the band's first album without founding member Dave Brockie, who portrayed Oderus Urungus, due to his heroin overdose death on March 23, 2014. The album is also the first to feature Michael Bishop since 1999's We Kill Everything, portraying the newest character, lead singer Bl\u00f6thar the Berserker, as opposed to his role as the original Beefcake the Mighty.\n\n"
