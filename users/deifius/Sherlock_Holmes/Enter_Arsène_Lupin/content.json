"Ars\u00e8ne Lupin (French pronunciation: \u200b[a\u0281s\u025bn lyp\u025b\u0303]) is a fictional gentleman thief and master of disguise created in 1905 by French writer Maurice Leblanc. He was originally called Ars\u00e8ne Lopin, until a local politician of the same name protested. The character was first introduced in a series of short stories serialized in the magazine Je sais tout. The first story, \"The Arrest of Ars\u00e8ne Lupin\", was published on 15 July 1905.\nLupin was featured in 17 novels and 39 novellas by Maurice Leblanc, with the novellas or short stories collected into book form for a total of 24 books. The number becomes 25 if the 1923 novel The Secret Tomb  is counted: Lupin doesn't appear in it, but the main character Doroth\u00e9e solves one of Ars\u00e8ne Lupin's four fabulous secrets.\nThe character has also appeared in a number of books from other writers as well as numerous film, television, stage play, and comic book adaptations. Five authorized sequels were written in the 1970s by the celebrated mystery writing team of Boileau-Narcejac.\n\n\n== Origin ==\nArs\u00e8ne Lupin is a literary descendant of Pierre Alexis Ponson du Terrail's fictional character Rocambole, whose adventures were published from 1857 to 1870. Like Rocambole, Lupin is often a force for good while operating on the wrong side of the law. Those whom Lupin defeats are worse villains than he is.  Lupin shares similarities with E. W. Hornung's gentleman thief A. J. Raffles, whose stories were published from 1898 to 1909. Both Raffles and Lupin have inspired later characters such as Louis Joseph Vance's The Lone Wolf (created in 1914) and Leslie Charteris's The Saint (created in 1928).\n\n\n== Fantasy elements ==\nSeveral Ars\u00e8ne Lupin novels contain some fantasy elements: a radioactive 'god-stone' that cures people and causes mutations is the object of an epic battle in L\u2019\u00cele aux trente cercueils; the secret of the Fountain of Youth, a mineral water source hidden beneath a lake in the Auvergne, is the goal sought by the protagonists in La Demoiselle aux yeux verts; finally, in La Comtesse de Cagliostro, Lupin's arch-enemy and lover is none other than Jos\u00e9phine Balsamo, the alleged granddaughter of Cagliostro himself.\n\n\n== Ars\u00e8ne Lupin and Sherlock Holmes ==\n\nLeblanc introduced Sherlock Holmes to Lupin in the short story \"Sherlock Holmes Arrives Too Late\" in Je sais tout No. 17, 15 June 1906. In it, an aged Holmes meets a young Lupin for the first time. After legal objections from Doyle, the name was changed to \"Herlock Sholmes\" when the story was collected in book form in Volume 1.\nSholmes returned in two more stories collected in Volume 2, \"Ars\u00e8ne Lupin contre Herlock Sholmes\", and then in a guest-starring role in the battle for the secret of the Hollow Needle in L'Aiguille creuse. Ars\u00e8ne Lupin contre Herlock Sholmes was published in the United States in 1910 under the title \"The Blonde Lady\" which used the name \"Holmlock Shears\" for Sherlock Holmes, and \"Wilson\" for Watson.\nIn 813, Lupin manages to solve a riddle that Herlock Sholmes was unable to figure out.\nSherlock Holmes, this time with his real name and accompanied by familiar characters such as Watson and Lestrade (all copyright protection having long expired), also confronted Ars\u00e8ne Lupin in the 2008 PC 3D adventure game Sherlock Holmes Versus Ars\u00e8ne Lupin. In this game Holmes (and occasionally others) are attempting to stop Lupin from stealing five valuable British items. Lupin wants to steal the items in order to humiliate Britain, but he also admires Holmes and thus challenges him to try to stop him.\nIn a novella \"The Prisoner of the Tower, or A Short But Beautiful Journey of Three Wise Men\" by Boris Akunin published in 2008 in Russia as the conclusion of \"Jade Rosary Beads\" book, Sherlock Holmes and Erast Fandorin oppose Ars\u00e8ne Lupin on December 31, 1899.\nDue to long-standing copyright issues related to the character of Sherlock Holmes with the estate of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the \"Herlock Sholmes\" was used for the character of the same name in the international release of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles in honour of Leblanc, with the characters of John and Iris Watson having their surnames changed to \"Wilson\".\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nArs\u00e8ne Lupin, Gentleman Burglar (Ars\u00e8ne Lupin, gentleman cambrioleur, 1907 coll., 9 novellas) (AKA: Exploits of Ars\u00e8ne Lupin, Extraordinary Adventures of Ars\u00e8ne Lupin)\nArs\u00e8ne Lupin vs. Herlock Sholmes (Ars\u00e8ne Lupin contre Herlock Sholm\u00e8s, 1908 coll., 2 stories) (AKA: The Blonde Lady)\nThe Hollow Needle (L'Aiguille creuse, 1909, novel)\n813 (813, 1910, novel)\nThe Crystal Stopper (Le Bouchon de cristal, 1912, novel)\nThe Confessions of Ars\u00e8ne Lupin (Les Confidences d'Ars\u00e8ne Lupin, 1913 coll., 9 novellas)\nThe Teeth of The Tiger (Les Dents du tigre, 1914, novel) Published in English in 1914, but remained unpublished in French until 1920.\nThe Shell Shard (L'\u00c9clat d'obus, 1916, novel) (AKA: Woman of Mystery) Not originally part of the Ars\u00e8ne Lupin series, Lupin was written into the story in the 1923 edition.\nThe Golden Triangle (Le Triangle d'or, 1918, novel) (AKA: The Return of Ars\u00e8ne Lupin)\nThe Island of Thirty Coffins (L\u2019\u00cele aux trente cercueils, 1919, novel) (AKA: The Secret of Sarek)\nThe Eight Strokes of The Clock (Les Huit Coups de l'horloge, 1922 coll., 8 novellas)\nThe Secret Tomb (Doroth\u00e9e, Danseuse de Corde, 1923.
