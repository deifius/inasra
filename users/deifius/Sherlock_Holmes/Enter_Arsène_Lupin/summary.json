"Ars\u00e8ne Lupin (French pronunciation: \u200b[a\u0281s\u025bn lyp\u025b\u0303]) is a fictional gentleman thief and master of disguise created in 1905 by French writer Maurice Leblanc. He was originally called Ars\u00e8ne Lopin, until a local politician of the same name protested. The character was first introduced in a series of short stories serialized in the magazine Je sais tout. The first story, \"The Arrest of Ars\u00e8ne Lupin\", was published on 15 July 1905.\nLupin was featured in 17 novels and 39 novellas by Maurice Leblanc, with the novellas or short stories collected into book form for a total of 24 books. The number becomes 25 if the 1923 novel The Secret Tomb  is counted: Lupin doesn't appear in it, but the main character Doroth\u00e9e solves one of Ars\u00e8ne Lupin's four fabulous secrets.\nThe character has also appeared in a number of books from other writers as well as numerous film, television, stage play, and comic book adaptations. Five authorized sequels were written in the 1970s by the celebrated mystery writing team of Boileau-Narcejac.\n\n"
