The name was spelled \"OkeH\" from the initials of Otto K. E. Heinemann but later changed to \"OKeh\". Since 1926, Okeh has been a subsidiary of Columbia Records, a subsidiary of Sony Music. Okeh is a Jazz imprint distributed by Sony Masterworks, a specialty label of Columbia.\n\n\n== Early history ==\n\nOkeh was founded by Otto K. E. Heinemann, a German-American manager for the U.S. branch of Odeon Records, which was owned by Carl Lindstrom. In 1916, Heinemann incorporated the Otto Heinemann Phonograph Corporation, set up a recording studio and pressing plant in New York City, and started the label in 1918.The first discs were vertical cut, but later the more common lateral-cut method was used. The label's parent company was renamed the General Phonograph Corporation, and the name on its record labels was changed to OKeh. The common 10-inch discs retailed for 75 cents each, the 12-inch discs for $1.25. The company's musical director was Frederick W. Hager, who was also credited under the pseudonym Milo Rega.\nOkeh issued popular songs, dance numbers, and vaudeville skits similar to other labels, but Heinemann also wanted to provide music for audiences neglected by the larger record companies. Okeh produced lines of recordings in German, Czech, Polish, Swedish, and Yiddish for immigrant communities in the United States. Some were pressed from masters leased from European labels, while others were recorded by Okeh in New York.\nOkeh's early releases included music by the New Orleans Jazz Band. In 1920, Perry Bradford encouraged Fred Hager, the director of artists and repertoire (A&R), to record blues singer Mamie Smith.  The records were popular, and the label issued a series of race records directed by Clarence Williams in New York City and Richard M. Jones in Chicago. From 1921 to 1932, this series included music by Williams, Lonnie Johnson, King Oliver, and Louis Armstrong. Also recording for the label were Bix Beiderbecke, Bennie Moten, Frankie Trumbauer, and Eddie Lang. One of the more popular series was Louis Armstrong's Hot Five and Hot Seven, who recorded about 3 sessions per year between 1925 and 1928, which included popular hits such as \"Heebie Jeebies,\" \"Cornet Chop Suey,\" and \"West End Blues.\" After the success of these records, Armstrong's records were transferred to the popular series as well, which was marketed towards a white audience in 1928. As part of the Carl Lindstr\u00f6m Company, Okeh's recordings were distributed by other labels owned by Lindstrom, including Parlophone in the UK. While musicians did not receive much payment for entering the studio, they copyrighted the songs they did record with the hopes that other bands would record the piece; in turn, they would make a steady stream from royaltiesIn 1926, Okeh was sold to Columbia Records. Ownership changed to the American Record Corporation (ARC) in 1934, and the race records series from the 1920s ended. CBS bought the company in 1938. OkeH was a label for rhythm and blues during the 1950s, but jazz albums continued to be released, as in the work of Wild Bill Davis and Red Saunders.\n\n\n== The OKeh Laughing Record ==\nThe OKeh Laughing Record was recorded in Germany by Beka Records by most accounts in 1920, and then later purchased from that record label by OKeh Records in the US. It features who are likely opera singer Lucie Bernardo and Otto Rathke simply laughing for nearly three minutes while accompanied by cornetist Felix Silbers. They recorded six recordings on the same day. It became a best-seller in the US in 1922, and is estimated to have sold around a million records. Okeh Records soon followed with the \"Second Laughing Record\", \"The OKeh Laughing Dance Record\" and \"The OKeh Crying Record\". Other record labels also released similar records. It may have influenced studios to include live audiences and laugh tracks in their shows. It was issued in the UK as The Parlophone Laughing Record and it was featured extensively in the Walter Lantz Productions cartoon short Sh-h-h-h-h-h, the last short directed by Tex Avery.\n\n\n== Race records and remote recording ==\n\nGeneral Phonograph Corporation used Mamie Smith's popular song \"Crazy Blues\" to cultivate a new market in 1920 and they could not keep the record on the shelves because of its popularity. Portraits of Smith and lists of her records were printed in advertisements in newspapers such as the Chicago Defender, the Atlanta Independent, New York Colored News, and others popular with African-Americans (though Smith's records were part of Okeh's regular 4000 series). Okeh had further prominence in the demographic, as African-American musicians Sara Martin, Eva Taylor, Shelton Brooks, Esther Bigeou, and Handy's Orchestra recorded for the label. Okeh issued the 8000 series for race records. The success of this series led Okeh to start recording music where it was being performed, known as remote recording or location recording. Starting in 1923, Okeh sent mobile recording equipment to tour the country and record performers not heard in New York or Chicago. Regular trips were made once or twice a year to New Orleans, Atlanta, San Antonio, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Detroit.  The Okeh studio in Atlanta also catered to what was called, \"Hillbilly\" (now Country) stars at that time.  One of the first was \"Fiddlin' John Carson, who is believed to have made the first country music recordings there in June 1923. A double sided record with \"The Little Old Log Cabin in the Lane\" and \"The Old Hen Cackled and the Rooster's Going To Crow.\"\n\n\n== 1940\u20131970 ==\nOkeh releases were infrequent after 1932, although the label continued into 1935. In 1940, after Columbia lost the rights to the Vocalion name by dropping the Brunswick label, the Okeh name was revived to replace it, and the script logo was introduced on a demonstration record announcing that event. The label was again discontinued in 1946 and revived again in 1951.In 1953, Okeh became an exclusive R&B label when its parent, Columbia, transferred Okeh's pop music artists to the newly formed Epic Records. Okeh's music publishing division was renamed April Music.\nIn 1963, Carl Davis became Okeh's A&R manager and improved Okeh's sales for a couple of years. Epic took over management of Okeh in 1965. Among the artists during Okeh's pop phase of the 1950s and 1960s were Johnnie Ray and Little Joe & the Thrillers.\nWith soul music becoming popular in the 1960s, Okeh signed Major Lance, who gave the label two big successes with \"The Monkey Time\" and \"Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um\". Fifties rocker Larry Williams found a musical home at Okeh for a period of time in the 1960s, recording and producing funky soul with a band that included Johnny \"Guitar\" Watson. He was paired with Little Richard, who had been persuaded to return to secular music. He produced two Little Richard albums for Okeh in 1966 and 1967, which returned Little Richard to the Billboard album chart for the first time in ten years and produced the hit single \"Poor Dog\". He also acted as the music director for Little Richard's live performances at the Okeh Club in Los Angeles. Bookings for Little Richard during this period skyrocketed. Williams also recorded and released material of his own and with Watson, with some moderate chart success. This period may have garnered few hits but produced some of Williams's best and most original work.\nMuch of the success of Okeh in the 1960s was dependent on producer Carl Davis and songwriter Curtis Mayfield. After they left the label (due to disputes with Epic/Okeh head Len Levy), Okeh gradually slipped in sales and was quietly retired by Columbia in 1970.\n\n\n== 1993\u20132000 ==\nIn 1993, Sony Music reactivated the Okeh label (under distribution by Epic Records) as a new-age blues label. Okeh's first new signings included G. Love & Special Sauce, Keb' Mo, Popa Chubby, and Little Axe.  Throughout the first year, in celebration of the relaunch, singles for G. Love, Popa Chubby and Keb' Mo were released on 10-inch vinyl.  By 2000, the Okeh label was again retired, and G. Love & Special Sauce was moved to Epic. It was re-launched in 2013 as a jazz line under Sony Masterworks.\n\n\n== Since 2013 ==\nIn January 2013, Sony Music reactivated the Okeh label as Sony's primary jazz imprint under Sony Masterworks. The imprint is part of Sony Masterworks in the U.S., Sony Classical's domestic branch, focusing on both new and established artists who embody \"global expressions in jazz\". The new artists include David Sanborn, Bob James, Bill Frisell, Regina Carter, and Dhafer Youssef.\n\n\n== Ownership ==\nSony Music Entertainment owns the global rights to the Okeh Records catalogue through Epic Records and Sony's Legacy Recordings reissue subsidiary.  EMI's rights to the Okeh catalogue in the UK expired in 1968, and CBS Records took over distribution.\n\n\n== See also ==\nOkeh Records artists\nList of record labels\nRalph Peer\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site\nOkeh masters in the Discography of American Historical Recordings\nOkeh album discography\nOkeh Records on the Internet Archive's Great 78 Project", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Okeh4042.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Okeh4423.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Okeh_Records_-_Talking_Machine_World%2C_February_1928.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Okehlogo.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg"], "summary": "Okeh Records () is an American record label founded by the Otto Heinemann Phonograph Corporation, a phonograph supplier established in 1916, which branched out into phonograph records in 1918.

It was founded in 1905 by Robert S. Abbott and was once considered the \"most important\" newspaper of its kind.  Abbott's newspaper reported and campaigned against Jim Crow-era violence and urged black people in the American South to come north in what became the Great Migration. Abbott worked out an informal distribution system with Pullman porters who surreptitiously (and sometimes against southern state laws and mores) took his paper by rail far beyond Chicago, especially to African American readers in the Southern United States. Under his nephew and chosen successor, John H. Sengstacke, the paper took on segregation, especially in the U.S. military, during World War II. Copies of the paper were passed along in communities, and it is estimated that at its most successful, each copy made its way into the hands of four out of five African-Americans.In 1919\u20131922, the Defender attracted the writing talents of Langston Hughes; from the 1940s through 1960s Hughes also wrote an opinion column for the paper. Washington D.C and international correspondent Ethel Payne,  poet Gwendolyn Brooks, author Willard Motley, journalists Ida B. Wells, L. Alex Wilson and Louis Lomax wrote for the paper at different times.  During the height of the civil rights movement era, it was published as The Chicago Daily Defender, a daily newspaper, beginning in 1956.  It returned to a weekly paper in 2008.In 2019, its publisher, Real Times Media Inc., announced that the Defender would cease its print edition but continue as an online publication.  The editorial board of the Chicago Tribune, noting the impact The Defender has had in its 114 years, praised the continuation of the publication in its new form.\n\n\n== Foundation and social impact, role in the Great Migration ==\n\nThe Chicago Defender's editor and founder Robert Sengstacke Abbott played a major role in influencing the Great Migration of African Americans from the rural South to the urban North by means of strong, moralistic rhetoric in his editorials and political cartoons, the promotion of Chicago as a destination, and the advertisement of successful black individuals as inspiration for blacks in the South.\nThe rhetoric and art exhibited in the Defender demanded equality of the races and promoted a northern migration. Abbott published articles that were expos\u00e9s of southern crimes against blacks. The Defender consistently published articles describing lynchings in the South, with vivid descriptions of gore and the victims' deaths. Lynchings were at a peak at the turn of the century, in the period when southern state legislatures passed new constitutions and laws to disenfranchise most blacks and exclude them from the political system. Legislatures dominated by conservative white Democrats established racial segregation and Jim Crow.\nAbbott openly blamed the lynching violence on the white mobs who were typically involved, forcing readers to accept that these crimes were \"systematic and unremitting\". The newspaper's intense focus on these injustices implicitly laid the groundwork upon which Abbott would build his explicit critiques of society. At the same time, the NAACP was publicizing the toll of lynching at its offices in New York City.\nThe art in the Defender, particularly its political cartoons by Jay Jackson and others, explicitly addressed race issues and advocated northern migration of blacks.\nAfter the movement of southern blacks northward became a quantifiable phenomenon, the Defender took a particular interest in sensationalizing migratory stories, often on the front page. Abbott positioned his paper as a primary influence of these movements before historians would, for he used the Defender to initiate and advertise a \"Great Northern Drive\" day, set for May 15, 1917. The movement to northern and midwestern cities, and to the West Coast at the time of World War I, became known as the Great Migration, in which 1.5 million blacks moved out of the rural South in early 20th century years up to 1940, and another 5 million left towns and rural areas from 1940 to 1970.\nAbbott used the Defender to promote Chicago as an attractive destination for southern blacks. Abbott presented Chicago as a promised-land with abundant jobs, as he included advertisements \"clearly aimed at southerners,\" that called for massive numbers of workers wanted in factory positions. The Defender was filled with advertisements for desirable commodities, beauty products and technological devices. Abbott's paper was the first black newspaper to incorporate a full entertainment section. Chicago was portrayed as a lively city where blacks commonly went to the theaters, ate out at fancy restaurants, attended sports events, including \"cheering for the American Black Giants, black America's favorite baseball team\", and could dance all night in the hottest night clubs.The Defender featured letters and poetry submitted by successful recent migrants; these writings \"served as representative anecdotes, supplying readers with prototype examples ... that characterized the migration campaign\".  To supplement these first-person accounts, Abbott often published small features on successful blacks in Chicago. The well-known African American mentalist Princess Mysteria had from 1920 to her death in 1930 a weekly column on the Defender, called \"Advise to the Wise and Otherwise.\"\n\nIn 1923, Abbott and editor Lucius Harper created the Bud Billiken Club for black children through the \"Junior Defender\" page of the paper. The club encouraged the children's proper development, and reading The Defender.  In 1929 the organization began the Bud Billiken Parade and Picnic, which is still held annually in Chicago in early August. In the 1950s, under Sengstacke's direction, the Bud Billiken Parade expanded and emerged as the largest single event in Chicago. Today, it attracts more than one million attendance with more than 25 million television viewers, making it one of the largest parades in the country.In 1928, for the first time, The Defender refused to endorse a Republican Party presidential candidate.  Throughout the election it ran a series of articles critical of the party, its failures to advance black civil rights, and what it saw as Republican's embrace or acquiescence in segregationism, party support in a revitalized Ku Klux Klan, and the Republican's Lily White Movement.  The paper's final pre-election editorial read in part: \u201cWe want justice in America and we mean to get it. If 50 years of support to the Republican Party doesn\u2019t get us justice, then we must of necessity shift our allegiance to new quarters.\u201d  For a variety of reasons, in the coming years, black support for the Republican Party fell rapidly.\n\n\n== Sengstacke era ==\nAbbott took a special interest in his nephew, John H. Sengstacke (1912\u20131997), paying for his education and grooming him to take over the Defender, which he did in 1940 after working with his uncle for several years. He urged integration of the armed forces. In 1948, he was appointed by President Harry S. Truman to the commission to study this and plan the process, which was initiated by the military in 1949.\nSengstacke also brought together for the first time major black newspaper publishers and created the National Negro Publishers Association, later renamed the National Newspaper Publishers Association (NNPA). In the early 21st century, the NNPA consists of more than 200 member black newspapers. Two days following the publishers' first meeting in Chicago, Abbott died.\nOne of Sengstacke's most striking accomplishments occurred on February 6, 1956, when the Defender became a daily newspaper and changed its name to the Chicago Daily Defender, the nation's second black daily newspaper. It immediately became the largest black-owned daily in the nation. It published as a daily until 2003, when new owners converted the Defender back to a weekly. The Defender was one of only three African-American dailies in the United States; the other two are the Atlanta Daily World, the first black newspaper founded as a daily in 1928, and the New York Daily Challenge, founded in 1971.  In 1965 Sengstacke created a chain of newspapers, which also included the Pittsburgh Courier, the Memphis Tri-State Defender, and the Michigan Chronicle.In a 1967 editorial, the Defender decried anti-Semitism in the community, reminding readers of the role of Jews in the civil rights movement. \"These powerful voices,\" the Defender wrote, \"which have been lifted on behalf of the Negro peoples' cause, should not be forgotten when resolutions are passed by the black power hierarchy. Jews and Negroes have problems in common. They can ill-afford to be at one another's throats.\"\n\n\n== Real Times Inc. ==\nControl of the Chicago Defender and her sister publications was transferred to a new ownership group named Real Times Inc. in January 2003. Real Times, Inc. was organized and led by Thom Picou, and Robert (Bobby) Sengstacke, John H. Sengstacke's surviving child and father of the beneficiaries of the Sengstacke Trust. In effect, Picou, then chairman and CEO of Real Times, Inc., led what was then labeled a \"Sengstacke family-led\" deal to facilitate trust beneficiaries and other Sengstacke family shareholders to agree to the sale of the company. Picou recruited Sam Logan, former publisher of the Michigan Chronicle, who then recruited O'Neil Swanson, Bill Pickard, Ron Hall and Gordon Follmer, black businessman from Detroit, Michigan (the \"Detroit Group\"), as investors in Real Times. Chicago investors included Picou, Bobby Sengstacke, David M. Milliner (who served as publisher of the Chicago Defender from 2003 to 2004), Kurt Cherry and James Carr.\nIn July 2019,  the Chicago Defender reported that recent print runs had numbered 16,000 but that its digital edition reached almost half a million unique monthly visitors.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nChicago Defender Building\nAfrican American Newspapers\nLongview Race Riot\nBessye J.

It was founded in 1905 by Robert S. Abbott and was once considered the \"most important\" newspaper of its kind.  Abbott's newspaper reported and campaigned against Jim Crow-era violence and urged black people in the American South to come north in what became the Great Migration. Abbott worked out an informal distribution system with Pullman porters who surreptitiously (and sometimes against southern state laws and mores) took his paper by rail far beyond Chicago, especially to African American readers in the Southern United States. Under his nephew and chosen successor, John H. Sengstacke, the paper took on segregation, especially in the U.S. military, during World War II. Copies of the paper were passed along in communities, and it is estimated that at its most successful, each copy made its way into the hands of four out of five African-Americans.In 1919\u20131922, the Defender attracted the writing talents of Langston Hughes; from the 1940s through 1960s Hughes also wrote an opinion column for the paper. Washington D.C and international correspondent Ethel Payne,  poet Gwendolyn Brooks, author Willard Motley, journalists Ida B. Wells, L. Alex Wilson and Louis Lomax wrote for the paper at different times.  During the height of the civil rights movement era, it was published as The Chicago Daily Defender, a daily newspaper, beginning in 1956.  It returned to a weekly paper in 2008.In 2019, its publisher, Real Times Media Inc., announced that the Defender would cease its print edition but continue as an online publication.  The editorial board of the Chicago Tribune, noting the impact The Defender has had in its 114 years, praised the continuation of the publication in its new form."}, "Roscoe_Simmons": {"links": ["Walter Loving", "Chicago Tribune", "Pittsburgh Courier", "Doi ", "Margaret Murray Washington", "Perry Wilbon Howard", "Alpha Kappa Alpha", "Roscoe Conkling", "SNAC-ID ", "Tuskegee Institute", "Journal of American Studies", "World War I", "GND ", "Booker T.

The nephew of Booker T. Washington, he wrote a column from Washington, D.C. about African-American issues for the Chicago Tribune and  was influential in the Republican Party.\n\n\n== Early life and education ==\nSimmons was born in Greenview, Mississippi in 1881. He was named after New York Republican congressman Roscoe Conkling. His sister was musician Alice Carter Simmons. Their father was principal at a school for African Americans in Hollandale, Mississippi. Simmons grew up in Aberdeen, Mississippi.The nephew of Booker T. Washington through Washington's third wife Margaret Murray Washington, when he was 12 years old Washington secured a job for him as an office boy to U.S. Senator Mark Hanna, a millionaire industrialist and the personal friend of William McKinley. Simmons' childhood spent with Hanna began his lifelong association with Republican politics and he would remain close friends with the powerful Hanna family for the rest of his life. Simmons graduated from the Tuskegee Institute.\n\n\n== Career ==\nSimmons began his career as a reporter for the Pensacola Daily Press before moving to the Chicago Defender, where the growing popularity of his columns made him that newspaper's highest-paid employee and a staple of its front page. During World War I he reported from Europe on the conditions of African-American soldiers in the U.S. Army. During this time he earned the nickname \"the Colonel,\" though reportedly never left Paris, having become \"distracted by its allure and its women.\"\n\nAs part of a scheme by the Military Intelligence Division to elevate the prominence of patriotic black leaders as a counter to the perceived threat of subversion within the African-American community, Simmons was engaged in a nationwide series of lectures and speeches. Major Walter Loving served as his manager. Simmons quickly established a reputation for unparalleled oratorical skills, with William Jennings Bryan calling him \"one of the great orators of the world.\" Promoted in advertisements as \"America's greatest orator,\" W. Herbert Brewster even attributed a 1916 speech by Simmons as his motivation \"to be somebody someday.\"In his stump speech \"My Country and My Flag\", Simmons declared:\n\nWe have but one flag, the flag that set us free. Its language is our only tongue, and no hyphen bridges or qualifies our loyalty. Today the nation faces danger from a foreign foe, treason skulks and stalks up and down our land, in dark councils intrigue is being hatched. Woodrow Wilson is my leader. What he commands me to do I shall do. Where he commands me to go I shall go. If he calls me to the colors I shall not ask whether my colonel is black or white. I shall be there to pick out no color except the white of the enemy's eyes.He was a member of the Colored Knights of Pythias. He delivered the main address in the 1929 general meeting.In the 1920s, he worked as the editor of The Chicago Defender, a black weekly paper published out of Chicago, Illinois. While editor, he was president of the Lincoln League and helmed the Speaker's Bureau, Western Division.In 1936, Simmons passed the bar and became a lawyer.\n\n\n=== Republican Party ===\nA lifelong Republican, Simmons was the driving force behind the party's lock on the African-American vote from the early 1900s through to the Great Depression. He formed part of the so-called \"Old Guard,\" a triumvirate of black party insiders that wielded significant backroom influence within the GOP and which also included Perry Wilbon Howard and Robert Reed Church. In 1936 he arranged to have an all-white South Carolina delegation to the national convention replaced with an integrated slate.Three times elected a delegate to the Republican National Convention, Simmons gave the second to the nomination of Herbert Hoover as candidate for the President of the United States at the 1932 convention. According to a report in the Pittsburgh Courier the day after the nomination, \"his exit from the platform was blocked by senators, committeemen, governors, and others high in the public life who sought to touch the hem of his garment.\"In 1936 Simmons was appointed chair of the Negro Speakers Bureau of the Republican Party, a group of prominent African-American GOP activists, by national committee chairman John Hamilton.Simmons twice unsuccessfully ran for elective office on the Republican ticket. In 1929, he mounted a primary challenge against Oscar Stanton De Priest for U.S. House of Representatives from Illinois's 1st congressional district. In 1933, he ran for the Illinois State Senate against King Roberts.\n\n\n=== Chicago Tribune ===\nFrom 1943 until 1946, Simmons wrote several articles for the Chicago Tribune about African-American issues.  Then, in 1946, he began writing a Washington, D.C.-based column called The Untold Story, featuring tales of successful African-Americans around the U.S. He wrote The Untold Story for the Tribune until his death in 1951.  Topics included Fisk University, which is a historically Black colleges and universities, Gen. Douglas MacArthur and the Republican Party.In 1951, Simmons was admitted, on behalf of the Chicago Tribune, to the Senate and House of Representatives press galleries; he was the third African-American to be allowed into the press gallery.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nSimmons was married twice, and had three sons with his first wife: William, Thomas, and Roscoe. His second wife, Althea Amaryllis Merchant, was initiated into the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority at the University of Illinois and would later serve as its regional director.Simmons was the godfather to Walter Loving, Jr., the son of Walter Loving. His correspondence and personal papers are held in deposit at Harvard University, from which his oldest son, William, graduated.In 1936, Simmons was baptized into the Catholic Church, as noted by a close friend.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWorks by or about Roscoe Simmons at Internet Archive\nPapers of Roscoe Conkling Simmons, 1917\u20131951, Harvard University Archive\nPapers of Roscoe Conkling Simmons, 1875\u20131951, Harvard University Archive", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Roscoe_Conkling_Simmons.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Roscoe_Simmons_handbill.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg"], "summary": "Roscoe Conkling Simmons (June 20, 1881 \u2013 April 27, 1951) was an American orator, journalist, and political activist.

The name was spelled \"OkeH\" from the initials of Otto K. E. Heinemann but later changed to \"OKeh\". Since 1926, Okeh has been a subsidiary of Columbia Records, a subsidiary of Sony Music. Okeh is a Jazz imprint distributed by Sony Masterworks, a specialty label of Columbia.\n\n\n== Early history ==\n\nOkeh was founded by Otto K. E. Heinemann, a German-American manager for the U.S. branch of Odeon Records, which was owned by Carl Lindstrom. In 1916, Heinemann incorporated the Otto Heinemann Phonograph Corporation, set up a recording studio and pressing plant in New York City, and started the label in 1918.The first discs were vertical cut, but later the more common lateral-cut method was used. The label's parent company was renamed the General Phonograph Corporation, and the name on its record labels was changed to OKeh. The common 10-inch discs retailed for 75 cents each, the 12-inch discs for $1.25. The company's musical director was Frederick W. Hager, who was also credited under the pseudonym Milo Rega.\nOkeh issued popular songs, dance numbers, and vaudeville skits similar to other labels, but Heinemann also wanted to provide music for audiences neglected by the larger record companies. Okeh produced lines of recordings in German, Czech, Polish, Swedish, and Yiddish for immigrant communities in the United States. Some were pressed from masters leased from European labels, while others were recorded by Okeh in New York.\nOkeh's early releases included music by the New Orleans Jazz Band. In 1920, Perry Bradford encouraged Fred Hager, the director of artists and repertoire (A&R), to record blues singer Mamie Smith.  The records were popular, and the label issued a series of race records directed by Clarence Williams in New York City and Richard M. Jones in Chicago. From 1921 to 1932, this series included music by Williams, Lonnie Johnson, King Oliver, and Louis Armstrong. Also recording for the label were Bix Beiderbecke, Bennie Moten, Frankie Trumbauer, and Eddie Lang. One of the more popular series was Louis Armstrong's Hot Five and Hot Seven, who recorded about 3 sessions per year between 1925 and 1928, which included popular hits such as \"Heebie Jeebies,\" \"Cornet Chop Suey,\" and \"West End Blues.\" After the success of these records, Armstrong's records were transferred to the popular series as well, which was marketed towards a white audience in 1928. As part of the Carl Lindstr\u00f6m Company, Okeh's recordings were distributed by other labels owned by Lindstrom, including Parlophone in the UK. While musicians did not receive much payment for entering the studio, they copyrighted the songs they did record with the hopes that other bands would record the piece; in turn, they would make a steady stream from royaltiesIn 1926, Okeh was sold to Columbia Records. Ownership changed to the American Record Corporation (ARC) in 1934, and the race records series from the 1920s ended. CBS bought the company in 1938. OkeH was a label for rhythm and blues during the 1950s, but jazz albums continued to be released, as in the work of Wild Bill Davis and Red Saunders.\n\n\n== The OKeh Laughing Record ==\nThe OKeh Laughing Record was recorded in Germany by Beka Records by most accounts in 1920, and then later purchased from that record label by OKeh Records in the US. It features who are likely opera singer Lucie Bernardo and Otto Rathke simply laughing for nearly three minutes while accompanied by cornetist Felix Silbers. They recorded six recordings on the same day. It became a best-seller in the US in 1922, and is estimated to have sold around a million records. Okeh Records soon followed with the \"Second Laughing Record\", \"The OKeh Laughing Dance Record\" and \"The OKeh Crying Record\". Other record labels also released similar records. It may have influenced studios to include live audiences and laugh tracks in their shows. It was issued in the UK as The Parlophone Laughing Record and it was featured extensively in the Walter Lantz Productions cartoon short Sh-h-h-h-h-h, the last short directed by Tex Avery.\n\n\n== Race records and remote recording ==\n\nGeneral Phonograph Corporation used Mamie Smith's popular song \"Crazy Blues\" to cultivate a new market in 1920 and they could not keep the record on the shelves because of its popularity. Portraits of Smith and lists of her records were printed in advertisements in newspapers such as the Chicago Defender, the Atlanta Independent, New York Colored News, and others popular with African-Americans (though Smith's records were part of Okeh's regular 4000 series). Okeh had further prominence in the demographic, as African-American musicians Sara Martin, Eva Taylor, Shelton Brooks, Esther Bigeou, and Handy's Orchestra recorded for the label. Okeh issued the 8000 series for race records. The success of this series led Okeh to start recording music where it was being performed, known as remote recording or location recording. Starting in 1923, Okeh sent mobile recording equipment to tour the country and record performers not heard in New York or Chicago. Regular trips were made once or twice a year to New Orleans, Atlanta, San Antonio, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Detroit.  The Okeh studio in Atlanta also catered to what was called, \"Hillbilly\" (now Country) stars at that time.  One of the first was \"Fiddlin' John Carson, who is believed to have made the first country music recordings there in June 1923. A double sided record with \"The Little Old Log Cabin in the Lane\" and \"The Old Hen Cackled and the Rooster's Going To Crow.\"\n\n\n== 1940\u20131970 ==\nOkeh releases were infrequent after 1932, although the label continued into 1935. In 1940, after Columbia lost the rights to the Vocalion name by dropping the Brunswick label, the Okeh name was revived to replace it, and the script logo was introduced on a demonstration record announcing that event. The label was again discontinued in 1946 and revived again in 1951.In 1953, Okeh became an exclusive R&B label when its parent, Columbia, transferred Okeh's pop music artists to the newly formed Epic Records. Okeh's music publishing division was renamed April Music.\nIn 1963, Carl Davis became Okeh's A&R manager and improved Okeh's sales for a couple of years. Epic took over management of Okeh in 1965. Among the artists during Okeh's pop phase of the 1950s and 1960s were Johnnie Ray and Little Joe & the Thrillers.\nWith soul music becoming popular in the 1960s, Okeh signed Major Lance, who gave the label two big successes with \"The Monkey Time\" and \"Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um\". Fifties rocker Larry Williams found a musical home at Okeh for a period of time in the 1960s, recording and producing funky soul with a band that included Johnny \"Guitar\" Watson. He was paired with Little Richard, who had been persuaded to return to secular music. He produced two Little Richard albums for Okeh in 1966 and 1967, which returned Little Richard to the Billboard album chart for the first time in ten years and produced the hit single \"Poor Dog\". He also acted as the music director for Little Richard's live performances at the Okeh Club in Los Angeles. Bookings for Little Richard during this period skyrocketed. Williams also recorded and released material of his own and with Watson, with some moderate chart success. This period may have garnered few hits but produced some of Williams's best and most original work.\nMuch of the success of Okeh in the 1960s was dependent on producer Carl Davis and songwriter Curtis Mayfield. After they left the label (due to disputes with Epic/Okeh head Len Levy), Okeh gradually slipped in sales and was quietly retired by Columbia in 1970.\n\n\n== 1993\u20132000 ==\nIn 1993, Sony Music reactivated the Okeh label (under distribution by Epic Records) as a new-age blues label. Okeh's first new signings included G. Love & Special Sauce, Keb' Mo, Popa Chubby, and Little Axe.  Throughout the first year, in celebration of the relaunch, singles for G. Love, Popa Chubby and Keb' Mo were released on 10-inch vinyl.  By 2000, the Okeh label was again retired, and G. Love & Special Sauce was moved to Epic. It was re-launched in 2013 as a jazz line under Sony Masterworks.\n\n\n== Since 2013 ==\nIn January 2013, Sony Music reactivated the Okeh label as Sony's primary jazz imprint under Sony Masterworks. The imprint is part of Sony Masterworks in the U.S., Sony Classical's domestic branch, focusing on both new and established artists who embody \"global expressions in jazz\". The new artists include David Sanborn, Bob James, Bill Frisell, Regina Carter, and Dhafer Youssef.\n\n\n== Ownership ==\nSony Music Entertainment owns the global rights to the Okeh Records catalogue through Epic Records and Sony's Legacy Recordings reissue subsidiary.  EMI's rights to the Okeh catalogue in the UK expired in 1968, and CBS Records took over distribution.\n\n\n== See also ==\nOkeh Records artists\nList of record labels\nRalph Peer\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial site\nOkeh masters in the Discography of American Historical Recordings\nOkeh album discography\nOkeh Records on the Internet Archive's Great 78 Project", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Okeh4042.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Okeh4423.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Okeh_Records_-_Talking_Machine_World%2C_February_1928.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Okehlogo.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg"], "summary": "Okeh Records () is an American record label founded by the Otto Heinemann Phonograph Corporation, a phonograph supplier established in 1916, which branched out into phonograph records in 1918.
