The four-volumes of the Universal Sherlock Holmes (1995) compiled by Ronald B. De Waal lists over 25,000 Holmes-related productions and products. They include the original writings, \"together with the translations of these tales into sixty-three languages, plus Braille and shorthand, the writings about the Writings or higher criticism, writings about Sherlockians and their societies, memorials and memorabilia, games, puzzles and quizzes, phonograph records, audio and video tapes, compact discs, laser discs, ballets, films, musicals, operettas, oratorios, plays, radio and television programs, parodies and pastiches, children's books, cartoons, comics, and a multitude of other items \u2014 from advertisements to wine \u2014 that have accumulated throughout the world on the two most famous characters in literature.\"\n\n\n== Board games ==\nThe board game 221B Baker Street (Gibsons Games) was first developed in 1975, and the book-based game Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective (Sleuth Publications) was published in 1981. Multiple expansions have since been published for both games. The board game A Study in Emerald, released in 2013, was based on the Sherlock Holmes pastiche \"A Study in Emerald\" by Neil Gaiman. Other Sherlock Holmes board games include Watson & Holmes (Ludonova, 2015), Beyond Baker Street (Z-Man Games, 2016), and Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty's Web (2016). Card games based on Sherlock Holmes include I Say, Holmes! (2007, updated 2014), Holmes: Sherlock & Mycroft (Devir Games, 2015), and Clash of Minds: Holmes vs Moriarty (2019).\n\n\n== Comic strip ==\nThree Sherlock Holmes adaptations have appeared in American newspapers. The first, titled Sherlock Holmes, ran from 1930 to 1931. Sherlock Holmes was drawn by Leo O'Mealia (who later drew covers for Action Comics) and distributed by the Bell Syndicate.  A short-lived half-page Sherlock Holmes comic strip appeared daily and Sunday in the 1950s, written by radio scriptwriter Edith Meiser and drawn by Frank Giacoia.  The third adaptation \"Mr. Holmes of Baker Street\" by Bill Barry appeared in 1976-1977. This adaptation of the famous detective was not very popular down south, but experienced a series of faithful followers in northern states.\n\n\n== Books ==\n\n\n=== Novels/Novellas ===\n\nThere are many novels, novellas, and short stories featuring Sherlock Holmes that were written by authors other than Arthur Conan Doyle.\n\n\n=== Comic books ===\n\nDespite the character's near-ubiquitous presence in other media and household recognition, in comic books Sherlock Holmes has been limited to the occasional miniseries or guest appearance. Sherlock Holmes cover artist Walt Simonson has speculated that this may be because the period setting is so difficult to draw.DC Comics' Sherlock Holmes one-shot (cover-dated September\u2013October 1975) adapts \"The Final Problem\" and \"The Adventure of the Empty House\". The one-shot's creative team of Dennis O'Neil (writer) and E. R. Cruz (artist) had coincidentally just come off of adapting another pulp crimefighter for DC, The Shadow. O'Neil and Cruz would each shortly take an additional turn at the character: The Joker #6, written by O'Neil, pitted Holmes (actually an actor suffering a head injury) against the title character, and the 50th anniversary issue of Detective Comics, drawn by Cruz, additionally commemorated the 100th anniversary of Sherlock Holmes.SelfMadeHero published \"Hound of the Baskervilles\", adapted by Ian Edginton and illustrated by Ian Culbard, in May 2009.\nIn The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Holmes appears in a flashback sequence depicting the climactic scene of \"The Final Problem\" and is still believed by the public to be deceased, although it is revealed in the second volume that Mina later meets with him.\nIn the 1990s, Caliber Comics issued a four-part Sherlock Holmes Reader which features quotes from Holmes, a map of 221-B Baker Street, and canon story adaptations as well as individual stories such as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Holmes and The Sussex Vampire.2009 brought the Black House Comics series The Dark Detective: Sherlock Holmes. The series is written by Christopher Sequeira with covers by Academy Award winning artist Dave Elsey.In 2010, Boom! Studios published a four-part series entitled Muppet Sherlock Holmes which featured Gonzo as Holmes, Fozzie Bear as Dr. Watson, and Kermit the Frog as Inspector Lestrade.In 2013, New Paradigm Studios began publishing a monthly, ongoing series entitled Watson and Holmes. The series re-imagines Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson as living in the 21st Century and living in Harlem.The BBC series Sherlock (see: Television series in this article) has a manga adaptation published in Japan by Kadokawa Shoten. The English translation of this series is being released by Titan Comics in the UK and US.\n\n\n== Film ==\n\nIt has been estimated that Sherlock Holmes is the most prolific screen character in the history of cinema. The first known film featuring Holmes is Sherlock Holmes Baffled, a one-reel film running less than a minute, made by the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company in 1900. This was followed by a 1905 Vitagraph film Adventures of Sherlock Holmes; or, Held for Ransom, with H. Kyrle Bellew and J. Barney Sherry in unlisted roles. It was long believed that the film starred Maurice Costello as Sherlock Holmes, but Leslie S. Klinger has written that the identification of Costello in the role is flawed. Klinger states that the first identification of Costello with the role was in Michael Pointer's Public Life of Sherlock Holmes published in 1975 but that Pointer later realized his error and wrote to Klinger stating\n\nI am now aware that Maurice Costello could not have been in that film, as he had not joined the Vitagraph company by that date. I'm sorry that my book has been misleading, but I doubt that I shall have the opportunity for an amended reprint, and should not have the time to prepare one anyway.\nMany similar films were made in the early years of the twentieth century, most notably the 13 one- and two-reel silent films produced by the Danish Nordisk Film Company between 1908 and 1911. The only non-lost film is Sherlock Holmes i Bondefangerkl\u00f8er, produced in 1910. Holmes was originally played by Viggo Larsen. Other actors who played Holmes in those films were Otto Lagoni, Einar Zangenberg, Lauritz Olsen, and Alwin Neuss. In 1911 the American Biograph company produced a series of 11 short comedies based on the Holmes character with Mack Sennett (later of Keystone Kops fame) in the title role.\nBy 1916, Harry Arthur Saintsbury, who had played Holmes on stage hundreds of times in Gillette\u2019s play, reprised the role in the 1916 film The Valley of Fear.The next significant cycle of Holmes films were produced by the Stoll Pictures company in Britain. Between 1921 and 1923 they produced a total of 47 two-reelers, all featuring noted West End actor Eille Norwood in the lead with Hubert Willis as Watson.\nJohn Barrymore played the role in a 1922 movie entitled Sherlock Holmes, with Roland Young as Watson and William Powell in his first screen appearance. This Goldwyn film is the first Holmes movie made with high production values and a major star.\nClive Brook played Sherlock Holmes three times: The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929), as part of the anthology film Paramount on Parade (1930), and Sherlock Holmes (1932).\nIn 1931 Raymond Massey played Sherlock Holmes in his screen debut, The Speckled Band, while Arthur Wontner played Holmes in five British films from 1931 to 1937.\nBasil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce played Holmes and Watson in The Hound of the Baskervilles, which launched a 14-film series. Rathbone is regarded as the Holmes of his generation.\nPeter Cushing played Sherlock Holmes along with Nigel Stock as Dr Watson in a 16 part series from 1968 to 1969 in the debut \u2018\u2018Hound of the Baskervilles\u201d as part of Hammer Horror. The series was broadcast on the BBC. This was the first depiction of Holmes in colour. \nIn 1970 the film The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes came out. In it Sherlock Holmes is portrayed by Robert Stephens, Dr. John H. Watson by Colin Blakely and Mycroft Holmes by Christopher Lee\nThe 1971 film They Might Be Giants explores the premise of a deranged man who believes himself to be Sherlock Holmes, with a psychiatrist becoming his Watson.In 1976, The Seven-Per-Cent Solution was released, adapted from the novel which was written as a pastiche by the American writer Nicholas Meyer. The film sees Sherlock Holmes being treated for a cocaine addiction with the help of Sigmund Freud.\nYoung Sherlock Holmes, a film about Sherlock Holmes's early adventures as a child, was released in 1985.In 1986 Walt Disney released The Great Mouse Detective, an animated animal film based on the tradition of Sherlock Holmes.\nRobert Downey Jr. and Jude Law portray Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson, respectively, in the film directed by Guy Ritchie in 2009 and its sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, released in 2011.\nIn 2015 Ian McKellen played a 93-year-old Sherlock Holmes in the film Mr. Holmes.\nA parody of the Sherlock Holmes franchise, titled Holmes & Watson, was released in late 2018, featuring Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly in the titular roles respectively.\n\n\n== Internet ==\nIn January 2004, the BBC posted five new Sherlock Holmes short stories on their \"Cult\" website, along with RealAudio files of the stories, as read by Andrew Sachs and Hannah Gordon. The audio productions were done in association with BBC 7, but are no longer available. The texts of all five short stories are still posted, with accompanying illustrations and illustration galleries, as well as an edited transcript of an interview with Bert Coules. The short story texts can also be downloaded as eBooks in three different formats.\n\n\n== Music ==\nComposer Jon Deak wrote a work for solo double bass based on The Hound of the Baskervilles, complete with narration and sound effects to mimic radio plays of the 1920s.Progressive rock musicians Clive Nolan & Oliver Wakeman released a concept album titled The Hound Of The Baskervilles about the story of the same name in 2002.\n\"Scarlet Story\", the opening theme of the NHK puppetry Sherlock Holmes is titled after \"A Study in Scarlet\". And a song titled \"Agra Treasure\" that is made for the show is sung in \"The Adventure of the Cheerful Four\", one of the episodes of the series based on \"The Sign of the Four\". In the episode, some of the characters are modeled after the members of the Beatles.\n\n\n== Radio ==\n\nIn the 1930s, writer, actress, and producer Edith Meiser was largely responsible for first bringing Holmes to American radio listeners. Meiser loved the Holmes stories, helped sell the show to the NBC radio network and found a sponsor. She wrote for the 1930\u20131936 radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, both adapting Doyle's classic tales and writing new adventures in the Holmesian style. The first show she adapted was \"The Adventure of the Speckled Band.\" It was broadcast on October 20, 1930, and featured William Gillette in the lead role. For most of the series, Richard Gordon played Holmes and Leigh Lovel played Watson.\nOne famous radio appearance starred Orson Welles as Sherlock Holmes in an adaptation of one of William Gillette's plays. This was broadcast in September 1938 as part of The Mercury Theater on the Air series on CBS Radio.\nMeiser also wrote for the radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce were cast after appearing in the 1939 film The Hound of the Baskervilles.\nNBC\u2019s Red and Blue networks carried the series until 1942. After that the shows were then written by the team of Dennis Green and Anthony Boucher. Then the Mutual Broadcasting System picked up the series, which it ran until 1947. Rathbone left in 1946 and was replaced by Tom Conway; Nigel Bruce remained for another season, with the proviso that Meiser continue to contribute \u201cnew adventures\u201d. Meiser's adaptations and original stories won praise from Conan Doyle's family for their faithful adherence to the original characterization. After a change of networks, there were two more pairings: John Stanley as Holmes and Alfred Shirley as Watson in 1947\u201348 and Stanley and \"George Spelvin\" (a pseudonym used by Wendell Holmes so he wouldn't be confused with the Sherlock Holmes character) in these roles in 1948\u201349. Both Stanley and Conway emulated Rathbone when performing Holmes to aid in continuity for the audience.\nJohn Gielgud played Holmes for BBC radio in the 1950s, with Ralph Richardson as Watson. Gielgud's brother, Val Gielgud, appeared in \"The Bruce-Partington Plans\", perhaps inevitably as Mycroft Holmes. As this series was co-produced by the American Broadcasting Company, known American actors also appeared, such as Orson Welles as Professor Moriarty in \"The Adventure of the Final Problem\".\nCarleton Hobbs portrayed Holmes in BBC broadcasts in a 1952\u20131969 radio series, with Norman Shelley playing Watson. Many of these were broadcast on Children's Hour. Of the many actors who have portrayed Holmes and Watson for the BBC, the Hobbs and Shelley duo is the longest running.\nThere have been many other radio adaptations (over 750 in English), including a more recent BBC Radio 4 run featuring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. Together, the two actors completed adaptations of every story in the canon in a 1989\u20131998 radio series. The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, a new series consisting of original stories written exclusively by Bert Coules, was then commissioned, but following Williams's death from cancer in 2001, he was replaced by Andrew Sachs. The episodes of The Further Adventures were based on throwaway references in Doyle's short stories and novels. The complete canonical run is available on CD and audio tape. The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is also available on CD as four box sets, each containing four episodes.\nBBC Radio 5 broadcast six new stories by John Taylor as the The Unopened Casebook of Sherlock Holmes in 1993 with Simon Callow as Holmes and  Nicky Henson as Watson.

These are presented within the Imagination Theatre program on radio stations and XM satellite radio. The new stories are also broadcast under the banner The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Holmes was played by John Gilbert until 2000, and subsequently by John Patrick Lowrie. Watson is played in all shows by Lawrence Albert. Scripts are by Jim French, M. J.

Elliott, French and his company began a new series based on Conan Doyle's original tales called The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Many episodes are available on CD as well as downloadable from the Imagination Theatre website.\n\n\n== Stage ==\n\nThe actor most associated with Holmes on stage was William Gillette, who wrote, directed, and starred in a popular play entitled Sherlock Holmes in seven different productions on Broadway from 1899 (filmed in 1916), while the stories were still being published, to 1930. His version of Holmes, dressed in deerstalker hat and Inverness cape and smoking a large curved calabash pipe, contributed much to the popular image of the character. The deerstalker hat appears occasionally in Paget's original illustrations for The Strand, but it is by no means a part of Holmes' regular clothing. Doyle's text is even vaguer, referring only to a travelling cap with earflaps in the passages with the relevant illustrations. He is also described as smoking several different types of pipes, varying them with his mood.\nWhile Gillette is the most well known stage actor to portray Holmes, the first was John Webb. Webb assayed Holmes in a play written by Charles Rodgers in 1894.Holmes is tangentially referred to in an unfinished play by L. Frank Baum and Emerson Hough called The King of Gee-Whiz (1905).\nIn Langdon McCormick's 1905 play, The Burglar and the Lady, Holmes is pitted against the fictional criminal A. J. Raffles, created by E. W. Hornung. McCormick did not secure permission from either Doyle or Hornung to use their characters.The calabash pipe is associated with Sherlock Holmes because early portrayers, particularly William Gillette and Basil Rathbone, made an artistic decision to use something large and easily recognized as a pipe.  A calabash pipe has a large air chamber beneath the bowl that provides a cooling and mellowing effect.  Holmes preferred harsh and strong tobaccos and therefore would eschew such a pipe.  In fact, most stories, particularly The Adventure of the Copper Beeches, described him as preferring a long-stemmed cherry-wood or a clay pipe.\nIn the first twenty years of the 20th century, Harry Arthur Saintsbury played Holmes on stage in Gillette\u2019s play more than 1,400 times. In subsequent revivals of this production, Holmes was played by John Wood, John Neville, Patrick Horgan, Robert Stephens and Leonard Nimoy. Frank Langella played Holmes in a 1981 production for HBO.\nIn 1923 the play The Return of Sherlock Holmes ran for 130 performances at the Princes Theatre, London.

On these occasions, Commander Data would replay and try to solve some of his favourite Holmes stories, or let the computer improvise a new mystery in the style of Doyle's stories. On most of these occasions, these exercises would result in a quick solution, since his android brain would immediately pick up all available clues, and his superior deductive skills would quickly solve the problem. Attempting to let the computer create a more difficult mystery for him however, resulted in the computer creating a holographic Professor James Moriarty which was imbued with a measure of consciousness, and who formed the basis for a story arc for said two episodes.
