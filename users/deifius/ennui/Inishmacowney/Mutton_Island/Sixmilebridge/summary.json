"Sixmilebridge (Irish: Droichead Abhann U\u00ed gCearnaigh, meaning \"Bridge of the River of O'Kearney\"), colloquially The Bridge, is a small town in County Clare, Ireland. Located midway between Ennis and Limerick city, the town is a short distance away from the main N18 road, being located on the old \"back road\" between the two. The village of Kilmurry (Irish: Cill Mhuire) is also part of the Sixmilebridge parish.\nSixmilebridge partly serves as a dormitory town for workers in the Limerick city, Ennis and Shannon region, with a number of modern housing developments having been built to accommodate demand.\n\n"
