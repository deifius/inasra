"Feakle (historically Feakell and Fiakil, from Irish: an Fhiacail, meaning \"the tooth\") is a village in County Clare, Ireland, in a civil parish and Roman Catholic parish of the same name.\n\n\n== Location ==\n\"Paroiste na fiacaile\" means parish of the tooth. A legend says that the tooth of Mochonna, the patron saint, fell out in this place, where he built his church.\nOther theories are that the place is named after a church that was roofed with \"fiathgail\", a rough local grass, or that the name comes from \"Fia-Choill\", the wood of the deer.The civil parish is in the Tulla Upper barony, 4.5 miles (7.2 km) northwest of Scarriff on the road to Gort.\nIn 1837 it contained 8,844 inhabitants and covered about 30,000 acres (12,000 ha).\nAn 1845 description said \"the surface consists of the loftiest, wildest, and most northerly of the western uplands of the county; and includes the southern declivities of the Slieve-Baghta mountains, and those offshoot ranges and masses which embosom Lough Graney, and stretch toward Lough O\u2019Grady. The highest ground is on the west, and has an altitude of 1,312 feet.\"The parish of Feakle is in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Killaloe.

The ancient ruins of his church were destroyed in the early 19th century.On 12 December 1974 Irish Republican Army and Sinn F\u00e9in leaders met at Smith's Hotel, Feakle, with the leaders of the main Irish Protestant Christian denominations (Church of Ireland, Methodist, and Presbyterian) to discuss ways of resolving the Northern Ireland crisis. The Garda\u00ed (Irish police) broke up the meeting. Although any wanted IRA men had already departed, the churchmen did pass on the list of Republican demands to the British government. Methodist leader Eric Gallagher was in attendance and later became the subject of the book Peacemaker by author Dennis Cooke.\n\n\n== People ==\nHerbalist Biddy Early (1798 - 1874).
