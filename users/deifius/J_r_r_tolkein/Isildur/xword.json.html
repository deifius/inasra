Tolkien's Middle-earth, the elder son of Elendil. He was born in N\u00famenor, and fled with his father when the island was drowned. He became King of Gondor. He cut the Ring from Sauron's hand, but instead of destroying it, claimed it for his own. He was killed by orcs, and the Ring was lost in the River Anduin, setting the stage for the Ring to pass to Gollum and then to Bilbo, as told in The Hobbit; that in turn provided the central theme for The Lord of the Rings. Isildur features briefly in the voiced-over opening sequence of Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy.\n\n\n== Fictional history ==\n\n\n=== In N\u00famenor ===\nIn Isildur's youth Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n, King of N\u00famenor, was corrupted by the fallen Maia Sauron, who urged that Nimloth the White Tree be cut down. Isildur went to the court of the king in disguise and stole a fruit of the tree. He was severely wounded during his escape, but his sacrifice was not in vain: Nimloth was cut down and burned shortly afterwards, but the line of the White Tree continued by way of the stolen fruit. When N\u00famenor was destroyed by Il\u00favatar Elendil's family escaped in nine ships.\n\n\n=== In Middle-earth ===\nThe refugees from N\u00famenor fled east to the continent of Middle-earth. Isildur's father Elendil landed in the north and founded the realm of Arnor, while Isildur and his brother An\u00e1rion landed in the south, where they established the realm of Gondor and the cities of Osgiliath, Minas Ithil, and Minas Anor.  Isildur lived in Minas Ithil on the east side of the River Anduin and An\u00e1rion in Minas Anor on the west side; they ruled Gondor jointly from Osgiliath.Sauron captured Minas Ithil and destroyed the White Tree Isildur had planted there. Isildur and his family escaped down the Anduin by boat, bearing with them a seedling of the tree. They sailed to Lindon, seeking the Elven King Gil-galad and Elendil in Arnor. An\u00e1rion bought time for Gondor by defending Osgiliath and driving the Dark Lord back to the mountains, while Elendil and Gil-galad marshalled their forces.\nAs told in The Fellowship of the Ring, Isildur returned with Elendil and Gil-galad in the Last Alliance of Elves and Men. After the Alliance defeated Sauron's host at the Battle of Dagorlad they advanced into Mordor and laid siege to Barad-d\u00fbr. When Minas Ithil was recaptured Isildur sent his younger sons Aratan and Ciryon to man that fortress, which prevented Sauron and his forces from escaping that way. Isildur was accompanied throughout the war by his eldest son Elendur.  The campaign in Mordor was long and bitter, and An\u00e1rion was killed by a stone from the Dark Tower.\nBesieged in the Dark Tower for seven years, the enemy was all but defeated, and Sauron himself appeared to challenge the king. During the final battle on the slopes of Mount Doom, Elendil and Gil-galad were both killed in combat with the Dark Lord, but Sauron's mortal form was destroyed as well. The Second Age ended, and Isildur became King of both Arnor and Gondor.\nIsildur took up the hilt-shard of Narsil, Elendil's sword, and cut the One Ring from the hand of Sauron. Despite the urging of Elrond and C\u00edrdan, Gil-galad's lieutenants, Isildur did not throw the Ring into the fires of Mount Doom. He made a scroll with a description of the Ring and a copy of its fading inscription. This scroll was deposited in the archives of Minas Anor (which much later was renamed Minas Tirith), and the scroll was discovered by Gandalf nearly an Age later.\nAfter the fall of Sauron, the greater part of the army of Arnor returned home while Isildur stayed in Gondor for a year, restoring order and defining its boundaries. He planted the seedling of the White Tree in Minas Anor in memory of An\u00e1rion. As his brother's helmet had been crushed during his death at Barad-d\u00fbr, Isildur left his own helmet as Gondor's crown. He installed An\u00e1rion's son Meneldil as King of Gondor, and returned north en route to Arnor with his three sons. He made first for Rivendell, where his wife and his fourth son, Valandil, had stayed throughout the War of the Last Alliance.\n\n\n=== Isildur's death ===\n\nAt the Gladden Fields in the middle course of the River Anduin Isildur's party was ambushed by roaming Orcs from the Misty Mountains. It was 5 'October' in the second year of Isildur's reign, and the second year of the Third Age.Tolkien wrote two differing accounts of the battle leading to Isildur's end.\n\"Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age\", at the end of The Silmarillion, is told from the point of the view of the Eldar. It states that Isildur had set no guard in his camp at night, deeming that all his foes had been overthrown, and orcs attacked him there.In Unfinished Tales Tolkien gives a fuller account, writing that Isildur was ambushed on the march by orcs. Isildur had left Minas Anor with a party of some 200 soldiers. His men had to march, as their horses were mainly beasts of burden, not for riding. They had two dozen archers, but they were too few to be effective. Isildur chose the route along the Anduin rather than the safer but longer road North. Sauron, however, had deployed an army of orcs east of the Misty Mountains to attack stragglers of the Last Alliance. The orcs did not show themselves when the armies of the Elves and Men passed by, but they were more than a match for Isildur's small company. Isildur was assailed at sunset.  Though the first orc sortie was beaten off, the orcs regrouped and surrounded Isildur's party to prevent his escape. When nightfall came the orcs assaulted him from all sides.The D\u00fanedain were surrounded and outnumbered.  Ciryon was killed and Aratan was mortally wounded in a failed attempt to rescue Elendur, who urged his father to flee. Isildur put on the Ring, hoping to escape under the cover of invisibility. Fleeing to the Anduin, he cast off his armour and tried to swim to the other side of the river, but the Ring slipped (of its own volition) from his finger. Isildur felt that the Ring was missing and was momentarily dismayed, but with the burden of the Ring removed he rallied and made for the opposite bank. Despite the darkness, the Elendilmir that he was wearing betrayed his position to orcs on the far bank, who were seeking survivors from the attack, and they killed him with their poisoned arrows. Isildur's squire, Ohtar, saved Elendil's sword from the enemy, fleeing into the valley before the orcs encircled Isildur's company. Estelmo, Elendur's squire, was found alive under his master's body, stunned by a club.During the War of the Ring the Nazg\u00fbl searched the Gladden Fields, but failed to find any traces of Isildur's remains. Their efforts were hampered by Saruman, who had deceived the Nazgul, and who had got there first. After the overthrow of Saruman and the opening of Orthanc (in The Two Towers) Gimli found a hidden closet containing the original Elendilmir, which was presumed lost when Isildur died.\n\n\n== Development ==\nIn the short work The Fall of N\u00famenor, written before 1937, Tolkien wrote of two brothers named Elendil and Valandil, who escaped the destruction of N\u00famenor and founded two kingdoms in Middle-earth, Elendil in the north and Valandil in the south. Valandil was thus a precursor to the later Isildur, although in this work he was not Elendil's son but his brother.Soon afterwards Tolkien started a time-travel story, The Lost Road, in which a father and a son were to reappear time and again in human families throughout history. Only two chapters were written, one set in or near the present day, with the father named Oswin and the son Alboin, and one set in N\u00famenor just before its fall, with the father named Elendil and the son Herendil. Here Valandil is the name of Elendil's father. It seems that Herendil (later Isildur) and his father were going to escape the destruction of N\u00famenor as in The Fall of N\u00famenor, but the story did not progress that far before it was abandoned.In one of the earliest manuscripts of The Lord of the Rings, written in 1938, in the chapter which came to be called The Shadow of the Past, Gandalf tells Frodo (then called Bingo) that his ring \"fell from the hand of an elf as he swam across a river\".  Although Isildur was not an elf, this was the earliest germ of the story of Isildur's death. In the next version of this part of the story Isildur himself appears, first named Ithildor, then changed to Isildor. He is described as a man who cut the One Ring from Sauron's finger after his father (here named Orendil) defeated Sauron in single combat, then lost it while swimming across a river to escape Orcs.\n\n\n== House of Elendil ==\n\n\n== Reception ==\nPaul H. Kocher writes that whereas Isildur claimed the Ring as his own, Aragorn, on hearing Frodo's exclamation that since he is Isildur's direct descendant the Ring must be his, at once renounces all claim to it. Aragorn explains that he searched for it to help Gandalf as \"it seemed fit that Isildur's heir should labour to repair Isildur's fault\", an inherited wrong. \nVedran Dodig writes that just as Jesus, in his role as king, is a descendant of King David, Aragorn is a descendant of Isildur. Nicholas Birns notes Isildur's survival, along with his father Elendil, of N\u00famenor's catastrophic fall, an event that recalls to him Plato's Atlantis, the Biblical fall of man, and Noah's flood; he notes that Tolkien called Elendil a \"Noachian figure\", an echo of the biblical Noah.Tom Shippey writes that Gandalf's account to the Council of Elrond of Isildur's description of the Ring combines hints of the ancient time in which Isildur lived, with old words like \"glede\" (a hot coal) and obsolete endings as in \"fadeth\", and \"loseth\", but with a sudden reminder of Gollum's name for the Ring, with \"It is precious to me, though I buy it with great pain.\" His use of the \"ominous word 'precious'\" is, Shippey writes, quite enough for readers to guess that Isildur was already becoming addicted to the Ring.\n\n\n== Adaptations ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\nIn Ralph Bakshi's animated film version of The Lord of the Rings, released in 1978, Isildur is called Prince Isildur of the mighty Kings from across the Sea and appears as the events of the Last Alliance are portrayed in silhouette. He is called \"the heroic shadow who slipped in\" to chop off the One Ring from Sauron's finger. Later, as he sat at the base of a tree by the River Anduin examining the One Ring. he senses a disturbance, draws his sword, and is shot by Orc arrows a moment later.\n\nIn Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy Isildur is played by Harry Sinclair. He briefly appears in the first scenes of The Fellowship of the Ring, and in an extended flashback scene later on. Isildur and Elrond go to Mount Doom where he refuses to destroy the Ring. The subsequent Disaster of the Gladden Fields is depicted; Isildur's column of mounted troops is ambushed on a dark forest road, he loses the Ring in the river Anduin, and is killed. In The Return of the King Legolas calls Isildur \"the last king of Gondor\", but in the extended edition both Arnor and the House of An\u00e1rion are mentioned, and it is clear that Isildur was not the last king. \nShippey writes that Jackson uses the voice-over to say of Isildur that he had \"this one chance to destroy evil for ever\", commenting that when Tolkien says \"for ever\", he at once indicates that that optimistic hope is wrong: Elrond says he recalls \"when Thangorodrim was broken, and the Elves deemed that evil was ended for ever, and it was not so.\" Shippey writes that there is a glimpse here of a sharp difference between Jackson's and Tolkien's concept of evil, and their respective media: Tolkien believed that even the best of men were fallen, victory always temporary, and portrayed that in his writings, whereas a dramatic medium like film required good on one side and bad on the other.\n\n\n=== Video games ===\nIn the video game Middle-earth: Shadow of War, Isildur's fate differs from the traditional accounts. After he was attacked by the orcs, they transported his lifeless body to Mordor at Sauron\u2018s behest, who then adorned Isildur with one of the nine rings. Isildur was then kept prisoner and tortured for an extended period of time and eventually became a Nazg\u00fbl after his spirit was broken. The specific power of his ring allowed him to raise the dead and have them fight by his side as mindless minions. Eventually, he was defeated by the game\u2018s protagonist, Talion, after several encounters. Instead of subduing him with his own ring of power, he chose to spare Isildur and release his spirit, finally allowing him to proceed into the afterlife after millennia of service to Sauron. Talion also obtained Isildur's ring and eventually took his place as a Nazg\u00fbl.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Primary ===\nThis list identifies each item's location in Tolkien's writings.\n\n\n=== Secondary ===\n\n\n== Sources ==\nCarpenter, Humphrey, ed.

Tolkien's legendarium, described as an evil spirit in the form of a spider. She is mentioned briefly in The Lord of the Rings, and plays a supporting role in The Silmarillion. Her origins are unclear, as Tolkien's writings do not explicitly reveal her nature, other than that she is from \"before the world\". She is one of a few instances, along with Tom Bombadil and the Cats of Queen Ber\u00fathiel, where Tolkien does not provide a clear background for an element of his fiction.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nUngoliant /\u028a\u014b.g\u0254l.jant/ means \"dark spider\" in Tolkien's invented language of Sindarin. It is a loan word from Quenya: Ungw\u00eb liant\u00eb /u\u014b.w\u025b li.an.t\u025b/. She is also known as Gloomweaver (Sindarin: Gwerlum /gw\u025br.l\u028am/, Quenya: Wirilom\u00eb /wi.ri.l\u0254.m\u025b/).\n\n\n== Internal history ==\n\nTolkien's original writings say that Ungoliant was a primeval spirit of night, named M\u00f3ru, who aided Melkor in his attack upon the Two Trees of Valinor, draining them of their sap after Melkor had injured them. She also consumed the reserves of light from the wells of Varda. Afterward the light of the trees persisted only within the Silmarils of F\u00ebanor. Ungoliant helped Melkor evade the Valar by shrouding them both in the impenetrable darkness she produced.Melkor had promised Ungoliant to yield anything she wished in return for her aid, but betrayed this promise by withholding the Silmarils, and summoned the Balrogs to repel her. Ungoliant fled to the Ered Gorgoroth in Beleriand. At some point she gave birth to the Giant Spiders, including the character Shelob in The Lord of the Rings. In The Silmarillion, it is stated that when she went into hiding her hunger was such that she would mate with other spiders only to devour them later, with her offspring used as food once fully grown. The Silmarillion hints that Ungoliant's unremitting hunger drove her to devour herself.\n\n\n== Literary origins ==\nAccording to Tolkien scholar John Wm. Houghton, the story of Ungoliant and Morgoth is comparable to the account in Milton's Paradise Lost in which Sin conceives a child, Death, by Satan. Both Sin and Death are always hungry; Satan says he will feed them, and leads them to the world.\n\n\n== In science ==\n\nUngoliant is the namesake of two species of spider: Nemesia ungoliant, a species of Nemesiidae which was described in 2007, and Ochyrocera ungoliant, an Ochyroceratidae species that was described in 2018.\n\n\n== In popular media ==\nUngoliant has been the subject of several heavy metal music songs. Her conflict with Morgoth over the Silmaril was the subject of Blind Guardian's song \"Into the Storm\", from their 1998 album Nightfall in Middle-Earth. Austrian black metal band Summoning had a song called \"Ungolianth\" on their 1995 album Minas Morgul. On their 2006 album The Morrigan's Call, the Irish Celtic metal band Cruachan featured a song \"Ungoliant\" as well as one named after Shelob.Ungoliant is mentioned in the 2012 film The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, the first film of Peter Jackson's film trilogy of The Hobbit, when the wizard Radagast the Brown conjectures on the origin of malevolent giant spiders endemic to Mirkwood.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Primary ===\nThis list identifies each item's location in Tolkien's writings.\n\n\n=== Secondary ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nTolkien, J.

romanized: Ainu; Russian: \u0410\u0439\u043d\u044b, romanized: Ayny), also known as the Ezo (\u8766\u5937) in historical Japanese texts, are an East Asian ethnic group indigenous to northern Japan, the original inhabitants of Hokkaido (and formerly North-Eastern Honsh\u016b) and some of its nearby Russian territories (Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands, Khabarovsk Krai and the Kamchatka Peninsula).Official estimates place the total Ainu population of Japan at 25,000. Unofficial estimates place the total population at 200,000 or higher, as the near-total assimilation of the Ainu into Japanese society has resulted in many individuals of Ainu descent having no knowledge of their ancestry.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-modern ===\n\nThe Ainu are the native people of Hokkaido, Sakhalin, and the Kurils. Early Ainu-speaking groups (mostly hunters and fishermen) migrated also into the Kamchatka Peninsula and into Honshu, where their descendants are today known as the Matagi hunters, which still use a large amount of Ainu vocabulary in their dialect. Other evidence for Ainu-speaking hunters and fishermen migrating down from northern Hokkaido into Honshu is through the Ainu toponyms which are found in several places of northern Honshu, mostly among the western coast and the T\u014dhoku region. Evidence for Ainu-speakers in the Amur region is found through Ainu loanwords in the Uilta and Ulch people.Recent research suggests that Ainu culture originated from a merger of the Okhotsk and Satsumon cultures. According to Lee and Hasegawa, the Ainu-speakers descend from the Okhotsk people which rapidly expanded from northern Hokkaido into the Kurils and Honshu. These early inhabitants did not speak the Japanese language; some were conquered by the Japanese early in the 9th century. In 1264, the Ainu invaded the land of the Nivkh people. The Ainu also started an expedition into the Amur region, which was then controlled by the Yuan Dynasty, resulting in reprisals by the Mongols who invaded Sakhalin. Active contact between the Wa-jin (the ethnically Japanese, also known as Yamato-jin) and the Ainu of Ezogashima (now known as Hokkaid\u014d) began in the 13th century. The Ainu formed a society of hunter-gatherers, surviving mainly by hunting and fishing. They followed a religion which was based on natural phenomena.During the Muromachi period (1336\u20131573), many Ainu were subject to Japanese rule. Disputes between the Japanese and Ainu developed into large-scale violence, Koshamain's Revolt, in 1456. Takeda Nobuhiro killed the Ainu leader, Koshamain.\n\nDuring the Edo period (1601\u20131868) the Ainu, who controlled the northern island which is now named Hokkaid\u014d, became increasingly involved in trade with the Japanese who controlled the southern portion of the island. The Tokugawa bakufu (feudal government) granted the Matsumae clan exclusive rights to trade with the Ainu in the northern part of the island. Later, the Matsumae began to lease out trading rights to Japanese merchants, and contact between Japanese and Ainu became more extensive. Throughout this period Ainu groups competed with each other to import goods from the Japanese, and epidemic diseases such as smallpox reduced the population. Although the increased contact created by the trade between the Japanese and the Ainu contributed to increased mutual understanding, it also led to conflict which occasionally intensified into violent Ainu revolts. The most important was Shakushain's Revolt (1669\u20131672), an Ainu rebellion against Japanese authority. Another large-scale revolt by Ainu against Japanese rule was the Menashi-Kunashir Battle in 1789.\nFrom 1799 to 1806, the shogunate took direct control of southern Hokkaid\u014d. Ainu men were deported to merchant subcontractors for five and ten-year terms of service, and were enticed with rewards of food and clothing if they agreed to drop their native language and culture and become Japanese. Ainu women were separated from their husbands and forcibly married to Japanese merchants and fishermen, who were told that a taboo forbade them from bringing their wives to Hokkaid\u014d. Women were often tortured if they resisted rape by their new Japanese husbands, and frequently ran away into the mountains. These policies of family separation and forcible assimilation, combined with the impact of smallpox, caused the Ainu population to drop significantly in the early 19th century.\n\n\n=== Meiji Restoration and later ===\nIn the 18th century, there were 80,000 Ainu. In 1868, there were about 15,000 Ainu in Hokkaid\u014d, 2000 in Sakhalin and around 100 in the Kuril islands.The beginning of the Meiji Restoration in 1868 proved a turning point for Ainu culture. The Japanese government introduced a variety of social, political, and economic reforms in hope of modernizing the country in the Western style. One innovation involved the annexation of Hokkaid\u014d. Sj\u00f6berg quotes Baba's (1890) account of the Japanese government's reasoning:\n... The development of Japan's large northern island had several objectives: First, it was seen as a means to defend Japan from a rapidly developing and expansionist Russia. Second ... it offered a solution to the unemployment for the former samurai class ... Finally, development promised to yield the needed natural resources for a growing capitalist economy.\nIn 1899, the Japanese government passed an act labelling the Ainu as \"former aborigines\", with the idea they would assimilate\u2014this resulted in the Japanese government taking the land where the Ainu people lived and placing it from then on under Japanese control. Also at this time, the Ainu were granted automatic Japanese citizenship, effectively denying them the status of an indigenous group.\n\nThe Ainu were becoming increasingly marginalized on their own land\u2014over a period of only 36 years, the Ainu went from being a relatively isolated group of people to having their land, language, religion and customs assimilated into those of the Japanese. In addition to this, the land the Ainu lived on was distributed to the Wa-Jin who had decided to move to Hokkaid\u014d, encouraged by the Japanese government of the Meiji era to take advantage of the island's abundant natural resources, and to create and maintain farms in the model of Western industrial agriculture. While at the time, the process was openly referred to as colonization (\u62d3\u6b96, takushoku), the notion was later reframed by Japanese elites to the currently common usage \u958b\u62d3 (kaitaku), which instead conveys a sense of opening up or reclamation of the Ainu lands. As well as this, factories such as flour mills, beer breweries and mining practices resulted in the creation of infrastructure such as roads and railway lines, during a development period that lasted until 1904. During this time, the Ainu were forced to learn Japanese, required to adopt Japanese names, and ordered to cease religious practices such as animal sacrifice and the custom of tattooing.The same act applied to the native Ainu on Sakhalin after the Japanese annexion and incorporation of the Karafuto Prefecture. Some historians noted that the Ainu language was still an important lingua franca in Sakhalin. Asahi (2005) reported that the status of the Ainu language was rather high and was also used by early Russian and Japanese administrative officials to communicate with each other and with the indigenous people.\n\nThe 1899 act was replaced in 1997\u2014until then the government had stated there were no ethnic minority groups. It was not until June 6, 2008, that Japan formally recognised the Ainu as an indigenous group (see \u00a7 Official recognition in Japan).The vast majority of these Wa-Jin men are believed to have compelled Ainu women to partner with them as local wives. Intermarriage between Japanese and Ainu was actively promoted by the Ainu to lessen the chances of discrimination against their offspring. As a result, many Ainu are indistinguishable from their Japanese neighbors, but some Ainu-Japanese are interested in traditional Ainu culture. For example, Oki, born as a child of an Ainu father and a Japanese mother, became a musician who plays the traditional Ainu instrument tonkori. There are also many small towns in the southeastern or Hidaka region where ethnic Ainu live such as in Nibutani (Niputay). Many live in Sambutsu especially, on the eastern coast. In 1966 the number of \"pure\" Ainu was about 300.Their most widely known ethnonym is derived from the word \"ainu\", which means 'human' (particularly as opposed to kamui, divine beings). Ainu also identify themselves as \"Utari\" ('comrade' or 'people' in the Ainu language). Official documents use both names.\n\n\n=== Official recognition in Japan ===\n\nOn June 6, 2008, the government of Japan passed a bipartisan, non-binding resolution calling upon the government to recognize the Ainu people as indigenous to Hokkaido, and urging an end to discrimination against the group. The resolution recognized the Ainu people as \"an indigenous people with a distinct language, religion and culture\". The government immediately followed with a statement acknowledging its recognition, stating, \"The government would like to solemnly accept the historical fact that many Ainu were discriminated against and forced into poverty with the advancement of modernization, despite being legally equal to (Japanese) people.\"  In February 2019, the Japanese government consolidated the legal status of the Ainu people by passing a bill which officially recognizes the Ainu as an indigenous people, based on Article 14 of the Constitution, \"all of the people are equal under the law\" and bans discrimination by race. Furthermore, the bill aims at simplifying procedures for getting various permissions from authorities in regards to the traditional lifestyle of the Ainu and nurture the identity and cultures of the Ainu without defining the ethnic group by blood lineage. A bill passed in April 2019 officially recognizes the Ainu of Hokkaid\u014d as the indigenous people of Japan.According to the Asahi Shimbun, the Ainu were due to participate in the opening ceremony of the Olympic games 2020 in Japan, but due to logistical constraints this was dropped in February 2020.Upopoy National Ainu Museum and Park opened on July 12, 2020. The space was scheduled to open on April 24, 2020, prior to the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games scheduled in the same year, in Shiraoi, Hokkaid\u014d. The park will serve as base for the protection and promotion of Ainu people, culture and language. The museum promotes the culture and habits of the Ainu people who are the original inhabitants of Hokkaid\u014d. Upopoy in Ainu language means \"singing in a large group\". The National Ainu Museum building has images and videos exhibiting the history and daily life of the Ainu.\n\n\n=== Official recognition in Russia ===\n\nAs a result of the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875), the Kuril Islands \u2013 along with their Ainu inhabitants \u2013 came under Japanese administration. A total of 83 North Kuril Ainu arrived in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky on September 18, 1877, after they decided to remain under Russian rule. They refused the offer by Russian officials to move to new reservations in the Commander Islands. Finally a deal was reached in 1881 and the Ainu decided to settle in the village of Yavin. In March 1881, the group left Petropavlovsk and started the journey towards Yavin on foot. Four months later they arrived at their new homes. Another village, Golygino, was founded later. Under Soviet rule, both the villages were forced to disband and residents were moved to the Russian-dominated Zaporozhye rural settlement in Ust-Bolsheretsky Raion. As a result of intermarriage, the three ethnic groups assimilated to form the Kamchadal community. In 1953, K. Omelchenko, the minister for the protection of military and state secrets in the USSR, banned the press from publishing any more information on the Ainu living in the USSR. This order was revoked after two decades.\n\nAs of 2015, the North Kuril Ainu of Zaporozhye form the largest Ainu subgroup in Russia. The Nakamura clan (South Kuril Ainu on their paternal side), the smallest group, numbers just six people residing in Petropavlovsk. On Sakhalin island, a few dozen people identify themselves as Sakhalin Ainu, but many more with partial Ainu ancestry do not acknowledge it. Most of the 888 Japanese people living in Russia (2010 Census) are of mixed Japanese\u2013Ainu ancestry, although they do not acknowledge it (full Japanese ancestry gives them the right of visa-free entry to Japan.) Similarly, no one identifies themselves as Amur Valley Ainu, although people with partial descent live in Khabarovsk. There is no evidence of living descendants of the Kamchatka Ainu.\nIn the 2010 Census of Russia, close to 100 people tried to register themselves as ethnic Ainu in the village, but the governing council of Kamchatka Krai rejected their claim and enrolled them as ethnic Kamchadal. In 2011, the leader of the Ainu community in Kamchatka, Alexei Vladimirovich Nakamura, requested that Vladimir Ilyukhin (Governor of Kamchatka) and Boris Nevzorov (Chairman of the State Duma) include the Ainu in the central list of the Indigenous small-numbered peoples of the North, Siberia and the Far East. This request was also turned down.Ethnic Ainu living in Sakhalin Oblast and Khabarovsk Krai are not organized politically. According to Alexei Nakamura, as of 2012 only 205 Ainu live in Russia (up from just 12 people who self-identified as Ainu in 2008) and they along with the Kurile Kamchadals (Itelmen of Kuril islands) are fighting for official recognition. Since the Ainu are not recognized in the official list of the peoples living in Russia, they are counted as people without nationality or as ethnic Russians or Kamchadal.The Ainu have emphasized that they were the natives of the Kuril islands and that the Japanese and Russians were both invaders. In 2004, the small Ainu community living in Russia in Kamchatka Krai wrote a letter to Vladimir Putin, urging him to reconsider any move to award the Southern Kuril Islands to Japan. In the letter they blamed the Japanese, the Tsarist Russians and the Soviets for crimes against the Ainu such as killings and assimilation, and also urged him to recognize the Japanese genocide against the Ainu people\u2014which was turned down by Putin.\n\nAs of 2012 both the Kuril Ainu and Kuril Kamchadal ethnic groups lack the fishing and hunting rights which the Russian government grants to the indigenous tribal communities of the far north.In March 2017, Alexei Nakamura revealed that plans for an Ainu village to be created in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, and plans for an Ainu dictionary are underway.\n\n\n== Origins ==\n\nThe Ainu have often been considered to descend from the diverse J\u014dmon people, who lived in northern Japan from the J\u014dmon period (c. 14,000 to 300 BCE). One of their Yukar Upopo, or legends, tells that \"[t]he Ainu lived in this place a hundred thousand years before the Children of the Sun came\".Recent research suggests that the historical Ainu culture originated from a merger of the Okhotsk culture with the Satsumon culture, cultures thought to have derived from the diverse J\u014dmon-period cultures of the Japanese archipelago.The Ainu economy was based on farming, as well as on hunting, fishing and gathering.According to Lee and Hasegawa of the Waseda University, the direct ancestors of the later Ainu people formed during the late J\u014dmon period from the combination of a distinctive Paleolithic population (likely from Central Asia) and a Northeast Asian population (Okhotsk) in northern Hokkaido, long before the arrival of contemporary Japanese people. Lee and Hasegawa suggest that the Ainu language expanded from northern Hokkaido and may have originated from the Northeast Asian/Okhotsk population, which established themselves in northern Hokkaido and had significant impact on the formation of Hokkaido's J\u014dmon culture.\n\nThe linguist and historian Joran Smale similarly found that the Ainu language likely originated from the ancient Okhotsk people, which had strong cultural influence on the \"Epi-J\u014dmon\" of southern Hokkaido and northern Honshu, but that the Ainu people themselves formed from the combination of both ancient groups. Additionally he notes that the historical distribution of Ainu dialects and its specific vocabulary correspond to the distribution of the maritime Okhotsk culture.\n\n\n=== Genetics ===\n\n\n==== Paternal lineages ====\n\nGenetic testing has shown that the Ainu belong mainly to Y-DNA haplogroup D-M55 (D1a2) and C-M217. Y DNA haplogroup D M55 is found throughout the Japanese Archipelago, but with very high frequencies among the Ainu of Hokkaid\u014d in the far north, and to a lesser extent among the Ryukyuans in the Ryukyu Islands of the far south. Recently it was confirmed that the Japanese branch of haplogroup D M55 is distinct and isolated from other D branches for more than 53,000 years.Several studies (Hammer et al. 2006, Shinoda 2008, Matsumoto 2009, Cabrera et al. 2018) suggest that haplogroup D originated somewhere in Central Asia. According to Hammer et al., the ancestral haplogroup D originated between Tibet and the Altai mountains. He suggests that there were multiple waves into Eastern Eurasia.\n\nA study by Tajima et al. (2004) found two out of a sample of sixteen Ainu men (or 12.5%) belong to Haplogroup C M217, which is the most common Y chromosome haplogroup among the indigenous populations of Siberia and Mongolia. Hammer et al. (2006) found that one in a sample of four Ainu men belonged to haplogroup C M217.\n\n\n==== Maternal lineages ====\nBased on analysis of one sample of 51 modern Ainu, their mtDNA lineages consist mainly of haplogroup Y [11\u204451 = 21.6% according to Tanaka et al. 2004, or 10\u204451 = 19.6% according to Adachi et al. 2009, who have cited Tajima et al. 2004], haplogroup D [9\u204451 = 17.6%, particularly D4 (xD1)], haplogroup M7a (8\u204451 = 15.7%), and haplogroup G1 (8\u204451 = 15.7%). Other mtDNA haplogroups detected in this sample include A (2\u204451), M7b2 (2\u204451), N9b (1\u204451), B4f (1\u204451), F1b (1\u204451), and M9a (1\u204451). Most of the remaining individuals in this sample have been classified definitively only as belonging to macro-haplogroup M.According to Sato et al. (2009), who have studied the mtDNA of the same sample of modern Ainus (N=51), the major haplogroups of the Ainu are N9 [14\u204451 = 27.5%, including 10\u204451 Y and 4\u204451 N9 (xY)], D [12\u204451 = 23.5%, including 8\u204451 D (xD5) and 4\u204451 D5], M7 (10\u204451 = 19.6%), and G (10\u204451 = 19.6%, including 8\u204451 G1 and 2\u204451 G2); the minor haplogroups are A (2\u204451), B (1\u204451), F (1\u204451), and M (xM7, M8, CZ, D, G) (1\u204451).Studies published in 2004 and 2007 show the combined frequency of M7a and N9b were observed in J\u014dmons and which are believed by some to be J\u014dmon maternal contribution at 28% in Okinawans [7\u204450 M7a1, 6\u204450 M7a (xM7a1), 1\u204450 N9b], 17.6% in Ainus [8\u204451 M7a (xM7a1), 1\u204451 N9b], and from 10% [97\u20441312 M7a (xM7a1), 1\u20441312 M7a1, 28\u20441312 N9b] to 17% [15\u2044100 M7a1, 2\u2044100 M7a (xM7a1)] in mainstream Japanese.In addition, haplogroups D4, D5, M7b, M9a, M10, G, A, B, and F have been found in J\u014dmon people as well. These mtDNA haplogroups were found in various J\u014dmon samples and in some modern Japanese people.\n\n\n==== Autosomal DNA ====\nA 2004 reevaluation of cranial traits suggests that the Ainu resemble the Okhotsk more than they do the J\u014dmon. This agrees with the references to the Ainu as a merger of Okhotsk and Satsumon referenced above. Similarly more recent studies link the Ainu to the local Hokkaido J\u014dmon period samples, such as the 3,800 year old Rebun sample.Genetic analyses of HLA I and HLA II genes as well as HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1 gene frequencies links the Ainu to some Indigenous peoples of the Americas. The scientists suggest that the main ancestor of the Ainu and of Native Americans can be traced back to Paleolithic groups in Siberia.Hideo Matsumoto (2009) suggested, based on immunoglobulin analyses, that the Ainu (and J\u014dmon) have a Siberian origin. Compared with other East Asian populations, the Ainu have the highest amount of Siberian (immunoglobulin) components, higher than mainland Japanese people.A 2012 genetic study has revealed that the closest genetic relatives of the Ainu are the Ryukyuan people, followed by the Yamato people and Nivkh.A genetic study by Kanazawa-Kiriyama in 2013 found that the Ainu people (including samples from Hokkaido and T\u014dhoku) are closer to ancient and modern Northeast Asians (especially Udege people of eastern Siberia) than opposed to the geographically close Kant\u014d J\u014dmon period samples. According to the authors, these results add to the internal-diversity observed among the J\u014dmon period population and that a significant percentage of the J\u014dmon period people had ancestry from a Northeast Asian source population, suggested to be the source of the proto-Ainu language and culture, which is not detected in samples from Kant\u014d.A genetic analysis in 2016 showed that although the Ainu have some genetic relations to the Japanese people and Eastern Siberians (especially Itelmens and Chukchis), they are not closely related to any modern ethnic group. Further, the study detected genetic contribution from the Ainu to populations around the Sea of Okhotsk but no genetic influence on the Ainu themselves. According to the study, the Ainu-like genetic contribution in the Ulch people is about 17.8% or 13.5% and about 27.2% in the Nivkhs. The study also disproved the idea about a relation to Andamanese or Tibetans; instead, it presented evidence of gene flow between the Ainu and \"lowland East Asian farmer populations\" (represented in the study by the Ami and Atayal in Taiwan, and the Dai and Lahu in Mainland East Asia).A genetic study in 2016 about historical Ainu samples from southern Sakhalin (8) and northern Hokkaido (4), found that these samples were closely related to ancient Okhotsk people and various other Northeast Asians, such as indigenous populations in Kamchatka (Itelmens) and North America. The authors conclude that this points to heterogeneity among Ainu, as other studies reported a rather isolated position of analyzed Ainu samples of southern Hokkaido.Recent autosomal evidence suggests that the Ainu derive a majority of their ancestry from the Jomon people. A 2019 study by Gakuhari et al., analyzing ancient Jomon remains, finds about 79.3% Hokkaido Jomon ancestry in the Ainu. Another 2019 study (by Kanazawa-Kiriyama et al.) finds about 66%.\n\n\n=== Physical Description ===\nAinu men have abundant wavy hair and often have long beards.The book of Ainu Life and Legends by author Ky\u014dsuke Kindaichi (published by the Japanese Tourist Board in 1942) contains a physical description of Ainu: \"Many have wavy hair, but some straight black hair. Very few of them have wavy brownish hair. Their skins are generally reported to be light brown. But this is due to the fact that they labor on the sea and in briny winds all day. Old people who have long desisted from their outdoor work are often found to be as white as western men. The Ainu have broad faces, beetling eyebrows, and large sunken eyes, which are generally horizontal and of the so-called European type. Eyes of the Mongolian type are hardly found among them.\"A study by Kura et al. 2014 based on cranial and genetic characteristics suggests a predominantly Northeastern Asian (\"Arctic\") origin for the majority of Ainu people. Thus, despite some Ainu having morphological similarities to Caucasoid populations, the Ainu are essentially of North Asiatic origin. Genetic evidence support a relation with Arctic populations, such as the Chukchi people.A study by Omoto has shown that the Ainu are more related to other East Asian groups (previously mentioned as 'Mongoloid') than to Western Eurasian groups (formerly termed as \"Caucasian\"), on the basis of fingerprints and dental morphology.A study published in the scientific journal \"Nature\" by Jinam et al. 2015, using genome-wide SNP data comparison, found that the some Ainu have gene alleles associated with facial features which are commonly found among Europeans but absent from Japanese people and other East Asians, but these alleles are not found in all tested Ainu samples.\n\n\n== Military service ==\n\n\n=== Russo-Japanese War ===\nAinu men were first recruited into the Japanese military in 1898. Sixty-four Ainu served in the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u20131905), eight of whom died in battle or from illness contracted during military service. Two received the Order of the Golden Kite, granted for bravery, leadership or command in battle.\n\n\n=== Second World War ===\nDuring World War II, Australian troops engaged in the hard-fought Kokoda Track campaign (July\u2013November 1942) in New Guinea, were surprised by the physique and fighting prowess of the first Japanese troops they encountered.\n\nDuring that day's fighting [30 August 1942] we saw many Japanese of large physique, powerfully built men of six feet and over. These tough assault troops came from Hokkaid\u014d, a northern Japanese island of freezing winters, where the bears roamed freely. They were known in their own country as \"Dosanko\" a name for horses from Hokkaid\u014d, and they withstood splendidly the harsh climate of the Owen Stanley Range. A 2/14th Battalion officer said to me: \"I couldn't believe it when I saw these big bastards bearing down on us. I thought they must be Germans in disguise.\"\n\n\n== Language ==\n\nIn 2008 Hohmann gave an estimate of fewer than 100 remaining speakers of the language; other research (Vovin 1993) placed the number at fewer than 15 speakers. Vovin has characterised the language as \"almost extinct\". As a result of this, the study of the Ainu language is limited and is based largely on historical research.\nDespite the small number of native speakers of Ainu, there is an active movement to revitalize the language, mainly in Hokkaid\u014d, but also elsewhere such as Kanto. Ainu oral literature has been documented both in hopes of safeguarding it for future generations, as well as using it as a teaching tool for language learners. \nAs of 2011 there has been an increasing number of second-language learners, especially in Hokkaid\u014d, in large part due to the pioneering efforts of the late Ainu folklorist, activist and former Diet member Shigeru Kayano, himself a native speaker, who first opened an Ainu language school in 1987 funded by Ainu Kyokai.Although some researchers have attempted to show that the Ainu language and the Japanese language are related, modern scholars have rejected the idea that the relationship goes beyond contact (such as the mutual borrowing of words between Japanese and Ainu). No attempt to show a relationship with Ainu to any other language has gained wide acceptance, and linguists currently classify Ainu as a language isolate. Most Ainu people speak either the Japanese language or the Russian language.\nConcepts expressed with prepositions (such as to, from, by, in, and at) in English appear as postpositional forms in Ainu (postpositions come after the word that they modify). A single sentence in Ainu can comprise many added or agglutinated sounds or affixes that represent nouns or ideas.\nThe Ainu language has had no indigenous system of writing, and has historically been transliterated using the Japanese kana or Russian Cyrillic. As of 2019 it is typically written either in katakana or in the Latin alphabet.\nMany of the Ainu dialects, even those from different extremities of Hokkaid\u014d, were not mutually intelligible; however, all Ainu speakers understood the classic Ainu language of the Yukar, or epic stories. Without a writing system, the Ainu were masters of narration, with the Yukar and other forms of narration such as the Uepeker (Uwepeker) tales being committed to memory and related at gatherings which often lasted many hours or even days.\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\nTraditional Ainu culture was quite different from Japanese culture. According to Tanaka Sakurako from the University of British Columbia, the Ainu culture can be included into a wider \"northern circumpacific region\", referring to various indigenous cultures of Northeast Asia and \"beyond the Bering Strait\" in North America.Never shaving after a certain age, the men had full beards and moustaches. Men and women alike cut their hair level with the shoulders at the sides of the head, trimmed semicircularly behind. The women tattooed their mouths, and sometimes the forearms. The mouth tattoos were started at a young age with a small spot on the upper lip, gradually increasing with size. The soot deposited on a pot hung over a fire of birch bark was used for colour. Their traditional dress was a robe spun from the inner bark of the elm tree, called attusi or attush. Various styles were made, and consisted generally of a simple short robe with straight sleeves, which was folded around the body, and tied with a band about the waist. The sleeves ended at the wrist or forearm and the length generally was to the calves. Women also wore an undergarment of Japanese cloth.\n\nModern craftswomen weave and embroider traditional garments that command very high prices. In winter the skins of animals were worn, with leggings of deerskin and in Sakhalin, boots were made from the skin of dogs or salmon. Ainu culture considers earrings, traditionally made from grapevines, to be gender neutral. Women also wear a beaded necklace called a tamasay.Their traditional cuisine consists of the flesh of bear, fox, wolf, badger, ox, or horse, as well as fish, fowl, millet, vegetables, herbs, and roots. They never ate raw fish or flesh; it was always boiled or roasted.Their traditional habitations were reed-thatched huts, the largest 20 ft (6 m) square, without partitions and having a fireplace in the center. There was no chimney, only a hole at the angle of the roof; there was one window on the eastern side and there were two doors. The house of the village head was used as a public meeting place when one was needed. Another kind of traditional Ainu house was called chise.Instead of using furniture, they sat on the floor, which was covered with two layers of mats, one of rush, the other of a water plant with long sword shaped leaves (Iris pseudacorus); and for beds they spread planks, hanging mats around them on poles, and employing skins for coverlets. The men used chopsticks when eating; the women had wooden spoons. Ainu cuisine is not commonly eaten outside Ainu communities; only a few restaurants in Japan serve traditional Ainu dishes, mainly in Tokyo and Hokkaid\u014d.The functions of judgeship were not entrusted to chiefs; an indefinite number of a community's members sat in judgment upon its criminals. Capital punishment did not exist, nor did the community resort to imprisonment. Beating was considered a sufficient and final penalty. However, in the case of murder, the nose and ears of the culprit were cut off or the tendons of his feet severed.\n\n\n=== Hunting ===\n\nThe Ainu hunted from late autumn to early summer. The reasons for this were, among others, that in late autumn, plant gathering, salmon fishing and other activities of securing food came to an end, and hunters readily found game in fields and mountains in which plants had withered.\nA village possessed a hunting ground of its own or several villages used a joint hunting territory (iwor). Heavy penalties were imposed on any outsiders trespassing on such hunting grounds or joint hunting territory.\nThe Ainu hunted bear, Ezo deer (a subspecies of sika deer), rabbit, fox, raccoon dog, and other animals. Ezo deer were a particularly important food resource for the Ainu, as were salmon. They also hunted sea eagles such as white-tailed sea eagles, raven and other birds. The Ainu hunted eagles to obtain their tail feathers, which they used in trade with the Japanese.\n\nThe Ainu hunted with arrows and spears with poison-coated points. They obtained the poison, called surku, from the roots and stalks of aconites. The recipe for this poison was a household secret that differed from family to family. They enhanced the poison with mixtures of roots and stalks of dog's bane, boiled juice of Mekuragumo (a type of harvestman), Matsumomushi (Notonecta triguttata, a species of backswimmer), tobacco and other ingredients. They also used stingray stingers or skin covering stingers.They hunted in groups with dogs. Before the Ainu went hunting, particularly for bear and similar animals, they prayed to the god of fire, the house guardian god, to convey their wishes for a large catch, and to the god of mountains for safe hunting.The Ainu usually hunted bear during the spring thaw. At that time, bears were weak because they had not fed at all during their long hibernation. Ainu hunters caught hibernating bears or bears that had just left hibernation dens. When they hunted bear in summer, they used a spring trap loaded with an arrow, called an amappo. The Ainu usually used arrows to hunt deer. Also, they drove deer into a river or sea and shot them with arrows. For a large catch, a whole village would drive a herd of deer off a cliff and club them to death.\n\n\n==== Fishing ====\n\nFishing was important for the Ainu. They largely caught trout, primarily in summer, and salmon in autumn, as well as \"ito\" (Japanese huchen), dace and other fish. Spears called \"marek\" were often used. Other methods were \"tesh\" fishing, \"uray\" fishing and \"rawomap\" fishing. Many villages were built near rivers or along the coast. Each village or individual had a definite river fishing territory. Outsiders could not freely fish there and needed to ask the owner.\n\n\n=== Ornaments ===\nMen wore a crown called sapanpe for important ceremonies. Sapanpe was made from wood fibre with bundles of partially shaved wood. This crown had wooden figures of animal gods and other ornaments on its centre. Men carried an emush (ceremonial sword) secured by an emush at strap to their shoulders.Women wore matanpushi, embroidered headbands, and ninkari, earrings. Ninkari was a metal ring with a ball. Matanpushi and ninkari were originally worn by men. Furthermore, aprons called maidari now are a part of women's formal clothes. However, some old documents say that men wore maidari. Women sometimes wore a bracelet called tekunkani.Women wore a necklace called rektunpe, a long, narrow strip of cloth with metal plaques. They wore a necklace that reached the breast called a tamasay or shitoki, usually made from glass balls. Some glass balls came from trade with the Asian continent. The Ainu also obtained glass balls secretly made by the Matsumae clan.\n\n\n=== Housing ===\n\nA village is called a kotan in the Ainu language. Kotan were located in river basins and seashores where food was readily available, particularly in the basins of rivers through which salmon went upstream. In the early modern times, the Ainu people were forced to labor at the fishing grounds of the Japanese. Ainu kotan were also forced to move near fishing grounds so that the Japanese could secure a labor force. When the Japanese moved to other fishing grounds, Ainu kotan were also forced to accompany them. As a result, the traditional kotan disappeared and large villages of several dozen families were formed around the fishing grounds.Cise or cisey (houses) in a kotan were made of cogon grass, bamboo grass, bark, etc. The length lay east to west or parallel to a river. A house was about seven meters by five with an entrance at the west end that also served as a storeroom. The house had three windows, including the \"rorun-puyar,\" a window located on the side facing the entrance (at the east side), through which gods entered and left and ceremonial tools were taken in and out. The Ainu have regarded this window as sacred and have been told never to look in through it. A house had a fireplace near the entrance. The husband and wife sat on the fireplace's left side (called shiso) . Children and guests sat facing them on the fireplace's right side (called harkiso). The house had a platform for valuables called iyoykir behind the shiso. The Ainu placed sintoko (hokai) and ikayop (quivers) there.\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n=== Traditions ===\nThe Ainu people had various types of marriage. A child was promised in marriage by arrangement between his or her parents and the parents of his or her betrothed or by a go-between. When the betrothed reached a marriageable age, they were told who their spouse was to be. There were also marriages based on mutual consent of both sexes. In some areas, when a daughter reached a marriageable age, her parents let her live in a small room called tunpu annexed to the southern wall of her house. The parents chose her spouse from men who visited her.\nThe age of marriage was 17 to 18 years of age for men and 15 to 16 years of age for women, who were tattooed. At these ages, both sexes were regarded as adults.When a man proposed to a woman, he visited her house, ate half a full bowl of rice handed to him by her, and returned the rest to her. If the woman ate the rest, she accepted his proposal. If she did not and put it beside her, she rejected his proposal. When a man became engaged to a woman or they learned that their engagement had been arranged, they exchanged gifts. He sent her a small engraved knife, a workbox, a spool, and other gifts. She sent him embroidered clothes, coverings for the back of the hand, leggings and other handmade clothes.\n\nThe worn-out fabric of old clothing was used for baby clothes because soft cloth was good for the skin of babies and worn-out material protected babies from gods of illness and demons due to these gods' abhorrence of dirty things. Before a baby was breast-fed, they were given a decoction of the endodermis of alder and the roots of butterburs to discharge impurities. Children were raised almost naked until about the ages of four to five. Even when they wore clothes, they did not wear belts and left the front of their clothes open. Subsequently, they wore bark clothes without patterns, such as attush, until coming of age.\nNewborn babies were named ayay (a baby's crying), shipo, poyshi (small excrement), and shion (old excrement). Children were called by these \"temporary\" names until the ages of two to three. They were not given permanent names when they were born. Their tentative names had a portion meaning \"excrement\" or \"old things\" to ward off the demon of ill-health. Some children were named based on their behaviour or habits. Other children were named after impressive events or after parents' wishes for the future of the children. When children were named, they were never given the same names as others.Men wore loincloths and had their hair dressed properly for the first time at age 15\u201316. Women were also considered adults at the age of 15\u201316. They wore underclothes called mour and had their hair dressed properly and wound waistcloths called raunkut and ponkut around their bodies. When women reached age 12\u201313, the lips, hands and arms were tattooed. When they reached age 15\u201316, their tattoos were completed. Thus were they qualified for marriage.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\nThe Ainu are traditionally animists, believing that everything in nature has a kamuy (spirit or god) on the inside. The most important include Kamuy-huci, goddess of the hearth, Kim-un-kamuy, god of bears and mountains, and Repun Kamuy, god of the sea, fishing, and marine animals. Kotan-kar-kamuy is regarded as the creator of the world in the Ainu religion.The Ainu have no priests by profession; instead the village chief performs whatever religious ceremonies are necessary. Ceremonies are confined to making libations of sake, saying prayers, and offering willow sticks with wooden shavings attached to them. These sticks are called inaw (singular) and nusa (plural).\nThey are placed on an altar used to \"send back\" the spirits of killed animals. Ainu ceremonies for sending back bears are called Iyomante. The Ainu people give thanks to the gods before eating and pray to the deity of fire in time of sickness. They believe that their spirits are immortal, and that their spirits will be rewarded hereafter by ascending to kamuy mosir (Land of the Gods).The Ainu are part of a larger collective of indigenous people who practice \"arctolatry\" or bear worship. The Ainu believe that the bear holds particular importance as Kim-un Kamuy's chosen method of delivering the gift of the bear's hide and meat to humans.\nJohn Batchelor reported that the Ainu view the world as being a spherical ocean on which float many islands, a view based on the fact that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west. He wrote that they believe the world rests on the back of a large fish, which when it moves causes earthquakes.Ainu assimilated into mainstream Japanese society have adopted Buddhism and Shint\u014d, while some northern Ainu were converted as members of the Russian Orthodox Church. Regarding Ainu communities in Shikotanto (\u8272\u4e39) and other areas that fall within the Russian sphere of cultural influence, there have been cases of church construction as well as reports that some Ainu have decided to profess their Christian faith. There have also been reports that the Russian Orthodox Church has performed some missionary projects in the Sakhalin Ainu community. However, not many people have converted and there are only reports of several persons who have converted. Converts have been scorned as \"Nutsa Ainu\" (Russian Ainu) by other members of the Ainu community. Even so, the reports indicate that many Ainu have kept their faith in the deities of ancient times.According to a 2012 survey conducted by Hokkaid\u014d University, a high percentage of Ainu are members of their household family religion which is Buddhism (especially Nichiren Sh\u014dsh\u016b Buddhism). However, it is pointed out that similar to the Japanese religious consciousness, there is not a strong feeling of identification with a particular religion.\n\n\n== Institutions ==\n\nMost Hokkaid\u014d Ainu and some other Ainu are members of an umbrella group called the Hokkaid\u014d Utari Association. It was originally controlled by the government to speed Ainu assimilation and integration into the Japanese nation-state. It now is run exclusively by Ainu and operates mostly independently of the government.\nOther key institutions include The Foundation for Research and Promotion of Ainu Culture (FRPAC), set up by the Japanese government after enactment of the Ainu Culture Law in 1997, the Hokkaid\u014d University Center for Ainu and Indigenous Studies established in 2007, as well as museums and cultural centers. Ainu people living in Tokyo have also developed a vibrant political and cultural community.Since late 2011, the Ainu have cultural exchange and cultural cooperation with the S\u00e1mi people of northern Europe. Both the S\u00e1mi and the Ainu participate in the organization for Arctic indigenous peoples and the S\u00e1mi research office in Lapland (Finland).Currently, there are several Ainu museums and cultural parks. The most famous are:\nNational Ainu Museum\nKawamura Kaneto Ainu museum\nAinu Kotan\nAinu folklore museum\nHokkaido Museum of Northern Peoples\n\n\n== Status ==\n\n\n=== Litigation ===\nOn March 27, 1997, the Sapporo District Court decided a landmark case that, for the first time in Japanese history, recognized the right of the Ainu people to enjoy their distinct culture and traditions. The case arose because of a 1978 government plan to build two dams in the Saru River watershed in southern Hokkaid\u014d. The dams were part of a series of development projects under the Second National Development Plan that were intended to industrialize the north of Japan. The planned location for one of the dams was across the valley floor close to Nibutani village, the home of a large community of Ainu people and an important center of Ainu culture and history. In the early 1980s when the government commenced construction on the dam, two Ainu landowners refused to agree to the expropriation of their land. These landowners were Kaizawa Tadashi and Kayano Shigeru\u2014well-known and important leaders in the Ainu community. After Kaizawa and Kayano declined to sell their land, the Hokkaid\u014d Development Bureau applied for and was subsequently granted a Project Authorization, which required the men to vacate their land. When their appeal of the Authorization was denied, Kayano and Kaizawa's son Koichii (Kaizawa died in 1992), filed suit against the Hokkaid\u014d Development Bureau.\nThe final decision denied the relief sought by the plaintiffs for pragmatic reasons\u2014the dam was already standing\u2014but the decision was nonetheless heralded as a landmark victory for the Ainu people. In short, nearly all of the plaintiffs' claims were recognized. Moreover, the decision marked the first time Japanese case law acknowledged the Ainu as an indigenous people and contemplated the responsibility of the Japanese nation to the indigenous people within its borders. The decision included broad fact-finding that underscored the long history of the oppression of the Ainu people by Japan's majority, referred to as Wa-Jin in the case and discussions about the case. The legal roots of the decision can be found in Article 13 of Japan's Constitution, which protects the rights of the individual, and in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The decision was issued on March 27, 1997, and because of the broad implications for Ainu rights, the plaintiffs decided not to appeal the decision, which became final two weeks later. After the decision was issued, on May 8, 1997, the Diet passed the Ainu Culture Law and repealed the Ainu Protection Act\u2014the 1899 law that had been the vehicle of Ainu oppression for almost one hundred years. While the Ainu Culture Law has been widely criticized for its shortcomings, the shift that it represents in Japan's view of the Ainu people is a testament to the importance of the Nibutani decision. In 2007 the 'Cultural Landscape along the Sarugawa River resulting from Ainu Tradition and Modern Settlement' was designated an Important Cultural Landscape. A later action seeking restoration of Ainu assets held in trust by the Japanese Government was dismissed in 2008.\n\n\n=== Governmental advisory boards ===\nMuch national policy in Japan has been developed out of the action of governmental advisory boards, known as shingikai (\u5be9\u8b70\u4f1a) in Japanese. One such committee operated in the late 1990s, and its work resulted in the 1997 Ainu Culture Law. This panel's circumstances were criticized for including not even a single Ainu person among its members.More recently, a panel was established in 2006, which notably was the first time an Ainu person was included. It completed its work in 2008 issuing a major report that included an extensive historical record and called for substantial government policy changes towards the Ainu.\n\n\n=== Formation of Ainu political party ===\nThe Ainu Party (\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc\u6c11\u65cf\u515a, Ainu minzoku t\u014d) was founded on January 21, 2012, after a group of Ainu activists in Hokkaid\u014d announced the formation of a political party for the Ainu on October 30, 2011. The Ainu Association of Hokkaid\u014d reported that Kayano Shiro, the son of the former Ainu leader Kayano Shigeru, will head the party. Their aim is to contribute to the realization of a multicultural and multiethnic society in Japan, along with rights for the Ainu.\n\n\n=== Standard of living ===\nThe Ainu have historically suffered from economic and social discrimination throughout Japan that continues to this day. The Japanese Government as well as people in contact with the Ainu, have in large part regarded them as a dirty, backwards and a primitive people. The majority of Ainu were forced to be petty laborers during the Meiji Restoration, which saw the introduction of Hokkaid\u014d into the Japanese Empire and the privatization of traditional Ainu lands. The Japanese government during the 19th and 20th centuries denied the rights of the Ainu to their traditional cultural practices, most notably the right to speak their language, as well as their right to hunt and gather. These policies were designed to fully integrate the Ainu into Japanese society with the cost of erasing Ainu culture and identity. The Ainu's position as manual laborers and their forced integration into larger Japanese society have led to discriminatory practices by the Japanese government that can still be felt today. This discrimination and negative stereotypes assigned to the Ainu have manifested in the Ainu's lower levels of education, income levels and participation in the economy as compared to their ethnically Japanese counterparts. The Ainu community in Hokkaid\u014d in 1993 received welfare payments at a 2.3 times higher rate, had an 8.9% lower enrollment rate from junior high school to high school and a 15.7% lower enrollment into college from high school than that of Hokkaid\u014d as a whole. The Japanese government has been lobbied by activists to research the Ainu's standard of living nationwide due to this noticeable and growing gap. The Japanese government will provide \u00a57 million (US$63,000) beginning in 2015, to conduct surveys nationwide on this matter.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\nThe traditional locations of the Ainu are Hokkaido, Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands, Kamchatka, and the northern Tohoku region. Many of the place names that remain in Hokkaido and the Kuril Islands have a phonetic equivalent of the Ainu place names.In 1756 CE, Mitsugu Nyui was a kanj\u014d-bugy\u014d (a high-ranking Edo period official responsible for finance) of the Hirosaki Domain in the Tsugaru Peninsula. He implemented an assimilation policy for Ainu who were engaged in fishing in the Tsugaru Peninsula. Since then, Ainu culture was rapidly lost from Honshu.After the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875), most of the Ainu from the Kuril islands were moved to the island Shikotan by persuading the pioneers for difficult life supplies and for defense purposes (Kurishima Cruise Diary).In 1945, the Soviet Union invaded Japan and occupied Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands. The Ainu who lived there were repatriated to their home country, Japan, except for those who indicated their willingness to remain.\n\n\n== Population ==\n\nThe population of the Ainu during the Edo period was a maximum of 26,800, but it has declined due to the epidemic of infectious diseases since it was regarded as a Tenry\u014d territory.\nAccording to the 1897 Russian census, 1,446 Ainu native speakers lived in Russian territory.Currently, there are no Ainu items in the Japanese national census, and no fact-finding has been conducted at national institutions. Therefore, the exact number of Ainu people is unknown. However, multiple surveys were conducted that provide an indication of the total population.\nAccording to a 2006 Hokkaido Agency survey, there were 23,782 Ainu people in Hokkaido.  When viewed by the branch office (currently the Promotion Bureau), there are many in the Iburi / Hidaka branch office. In addition, the definition of \"Ainu\" by the Hokkaido Agency in this survey is \"a person who seems to have inherited the blood of Ainu\" or \"the same livelihood as those with marriage or adoption.\" Additionally, if it is denied that the other person is an Ainu then it is not subject to investigation.\nAccording to a 1971 survey, there were 77,000 survey results. There is also a survey that the total number of Ainu living in Japan is 200,000. However, there's no other survey that supports this estimate.\nMany Ainu live outside Hokkaido. A 1988 survey estimated that the population of Ainu living in Tokyo was 2,700. According to a 1989 survey report on Utari living in Tokyo, it is estimated that the area around Tokyo alone exceeds 10% of Ainu living in Hokkaido, and there are more than 10,000 Ainu living in the Tokyo metropolitan area.\nIn addition to Japan and Russia, it was reported in 1992 that there was a descendant of Kuril Ainu in Poland, but there are also indications that it is a descendant of the Aleut. On the other hand, the descendant of the children born in Poland by the Polish anthropologist Bronis\u0142aw Pi\u0142sudski, who was the leading Ainu researcher and left a vast amount of research material such as photographs and wax tubes, was born in Japan.\nAccording to a 2017 survey, the Ainu population in Hokkaido is about 13,000. This has dropped sharply from 24,000 in 2006, but this is because the number of members of the Ainu Association of Hokkaido, which is cooperating with the survey, has decreased, and interest in protecting personal information has increased. It is thought that the number of people who cooperated is decreasing, and that it does not match the actual number of people.\n\n\n=== Subgroups ===\nThese are unofficial sub groups of the Ainu people with location and population estimates. According to historical records and census only a small population of pure-blooded Ainu still exist. That amount continues to decrease. Many who claim Ainu heritage are multiracial.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe characters Nakoruru, Rimururu, and Rera from the SNK game series Samurai Shodown are Ainu.\nThe manga and anime series Golden Kamuy has an Ainu girl, Asirpa, as one of the protagonists, and features many aspects of Ainu culture.\nThe character Fredzilla from Big Hero 6 is of Ainu descent.\nThe character Okuru from the anime series Samurai Champloo is the sole survivor of an Ainu village wiped out by disease.\nUsui Horokeu, also known as Horohoro, from the manga series Shaman King is a member of an Ainu tribe.\n\"Ainu\" is a playable nation in the game Europa Universalis IV.\nThe history of the island of Hokkaido, and of the Ainu people, are part of the plot of a chapter in the manga Silver Spoon.\nA coming-of-age film, Ainu Mosir (2020), was released in Japan on 17 October 2020. The film portrays Kanto, a sensitive 14 year-old Ainu boy, who struggled to come to terms with his father's death and his identity. The film also focuses on the dilemma of controversial bear sacrifice under the shadow of the modern Japanese society and the Ainu's heavy reliance on tourists for their livelihood. Along with other restless teenagers, Kanto is under pressure to retain their Ainu identity and participate in the cultural rituals.\nIn the James Bond novel You Only Live Twice and film, Bond's character spends some time living in an Ainu village and (in the film) is supposedly disguised as one of the local people, 'marrying' a local pearl fisher (ama) as part of his cover.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nJapan Times.

The literal meaning of perestroika is \"restructuring\", referring to the restructuring of the Soviet political and economic system, in an attempt to end the Brezhnev Stagnation.\nPerestroika allowed more independent actions from various ministries and introduced many market-like reforms. The alleged goal of perestroika, however, was not to end the command economy but rather to make socialism work more efficiently to better meet the needs of Soviet citizens by adopting elements of liberal economics. The process of implementing perestroika created shortages, political, social, and economic tensions within the Soviet Union and is often blamed for the political ascent of nationalism and nationalist political parties in the constituent republics. Perestroika and its associated structural ailments have been cited as major catalysts leading to the dissolution of the Soviet Union.Perestroika is sometimes argued to be a significant cause of the collapse of the Eastern Bloc and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which marked the end of the Cold War.\n\n\n== Origin and time ==\nMikhail Gorbachev first used the term Perestroika in a speech during his visit to the City of Togliatti in 1986. \nPerestroika lasted from 1985 until 1991.\n\n\n== Economic reforms ==\nIn May 1985, Gorbachev gave a speech in Leningrad in which he admitted the slowing of economic development, and inadequate living standards.The program was furthered at the 27th Congress of the Communist Party in Gorbachev's report to the congress, in which he spoke about \"perestroika\", \"uskoreniye\", \"human factor\", \"glasnost\", and \"expansion of the khozraschyot\" (commercialization).\nDuring the initial period (1985\u201387) of Mikhail Gorbachev's time in power, he talked about modifying central planning but did not make any truly fundamental changes (uskoreniye; \"acceleration\"). Gorbachev and his team of economic advisors then introduced more fundamental reforms, which became known as perestroika (restructuring).\nAt the June 1987 plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), Gorbachev presented his \"basic theses\", which laid the political foundation of economic reform for the remainder of the existence of the Soviet Union.\nIn July 1987, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union passed the Law on State Enterprise. The law stipulated that state enterprises were free to determine output levels based on demand from consumers and other enterprises. Enterprises had to fulfill state orders, but they could dispose of the remaining output as they saw fit. However, at the same time the state still held control over the means of production for these enterprises, thus limiting their ability to enact full-cost accountability. Enterprises bought input from suppliers at negotiated contract prices. Under the law, enterprises became self-financing; that is, they had to cover expenses (wages, taxes, supplies, and debt service) through revenues. No longer was the government to rescue unprofitable enterprises that could face bankruptcy. Finally, the law shifted control over the enterprise operations from ministries to elected workers' collectives. Gosplan's (Russian: \u0413\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0301\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0301\u0442 \u043f\u043e \u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0301\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044e; Gosudarstvenniy komitet po planirovaniyu; \"State Committee for Planning\") responsibilities were to supply general guidelines and national investment priorities, not to formulate detailed production plans.\nThe Law on Cooperatives, enacted in May 1988, was perhaps the most radical of the economic reforms during the early part of the Gorbachev era. For the first time since Vladimir Lenin's New Economic Policy was abolished in 1928, the law permitted collective ownership of businesses in the services, manufacturing, and foreign-trade sectors. The law initially imposed high taxes and employment restrictions, but it later revised these to avoid discouraging private-sector activity. Under this provision, cooperative restaurants, shops, and manufacturers became part of the Soviet scene.\nGorbachev brought perestroika to the Soviet Union's foreign economic sector with measures that Soviet economists considered bold at that time. His programme virtually eliminated the monopoly that the Ministry of Foreign Trade had once held on most trade operations. It permitted the ministries of the various industrial and agricultural branches to conduct foreign trade in sectors under their responsibility, rather than having to operate indirectly through the bureaucracy of trade ministry organizations. In addition, regional and local organizations and individual state enterprises were permitted to conduct foreign trade. This change was an attempt to redress a major imperfection in the Soviet foreign trade regime: the lack of contact between Soviet end users and suppliers and their foreign partners.\nThe most significant of Gorbachev's reforms in the foreign economic sector allowed foreigners to invest in the Soviet Union in the form of joint ventures with Soviet ministries, state enterprises, and cooperatives. The original version of the Soviet Joint Venture Law, which went into effect in June 1987, limited foreign shares of a Soviet venture to 49 percent and required that Soviet citizens occupy the positions of chairman and general manager. After potential Western partners complained, the government revised the regulations to allow majority foreign ownership and control. Under the terms of the Joint Venture Law, the Soviet partner supplied labor, infrastructure, and a potentially large domestic market. The foreign partner supplied capital, technology, entrepreneurial expertise, and in many cases, products and services of world competitive quality.\nGorbachev's economic changes did not do much to restart the country's sluggish economy in the late 1980s. The reforms decentralised things to some extent, although price controls remained, as did the rouble's inconvertibility and most government controls over the means of production.\n\n\n== Comparison with China ==\nPerestroika and Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms have similar origins but very different effects on their respective countries' economies. Both efforts occurred in large socialist countries attempting to liberalise their economies, but while China's GDP has grown consistently since the late 1980s (albeit from a much lower level), national GDP in the USSR and in many of its successor states fell precipitously throughout the 1990s. Gorbachev's reforms were gradualist and maintained many of the macroeconomic aspects of the command economy (including price controls, inconvertibility of the rouble, exclusion of private property ownership, and the government monopoly over most means of production).Reform was largely focused on industry and on cooperatives, and a limited role was given to the development of foreign investment and international trade. Factory managers were expected to meet state demands for goods, but to find their own funding. Perestroika reforms went far enough to create new bottlenecks in the Soviet economy but arguably did not go far enough to effectively streamline it.Chinese economic reform was, by contrast, a bottom-up attempt at reform, focusing on light industry and agriculture (namely allowing peasants to sell produce grown on private holdings at market prices). Economic reforms were fostered through the development of \"Special Economic Zones\", designed for export and to attract foreign investment, municipally managed Township and Village Enterprises and a \"dual pricing\" system leading to the steady phasing out of state-dictated prices. Greater latitude was given to managers of state-owned factories, while capital was made available to them through a reformed banking system and through fiscal policies (in contrast to the fiscal anarchy and fall in revenue experienced by the Soviet government during perestroika). Perestroika was expected to lead to results such as market pricing and privately sold produce, but the Union dissolved before advanced stages were reached.Another fundamental difference is that where perestroika was accompanied by greater political freedoms under Gorbachev's glasnost policies, Chinese economic reform has been accompanied by continued authoritarian rule and a suppression of political dissidents, most notably at Tiananmen Square. Gorbachev acknowledges this difference but has always maintained that it was unavoidable and that perestroika would have been doomed to defeat and revanchism by the nomenklatura without glasnost, because conditions in the Soviet Union were not identical to those in China. Gorbachev had lived through the era in which the attempted reforms by Khrushchev, limited as they were, were rolled back under Brezhnev and other pro-totalitarian conservatives, and he could clearly see that the same could happen again without glasnost to allow broad oppositional pressure against the nomenklatura. Gorbachev cited a line from a 1986 newspaper article that he felt encapsulated this reality: \"The apparatus broke Khrushchev's neck and the same thing will happen now.\"Another difference is that Soviet Union faced strong secession threats from its ethnic regions and a primacy challenge by the RSFSR. Gorbachev's extension of regional autonomy removed the suppression from existing ethnic-regional tension, while Deng's reforms did not alter the tight grip of the central government on any of their autonomous regions. The Soviet Union's dual nature, part supranational union of republics and part unitary state, played a part in the difficulty of controlling the pace of restructuring, especially once the new Russian Communist Party was formed and posed a challenge to the primacy of the CPSU. Gorbachev described this process as a \"parade of sovereignties\" and identified it as the factor that most undermined the gradualism of restructuring and the preservation of the Soviet Union.\n\n\n== Perestroika and glasnost ==\n\nOne of the final important measures taken on the continuation of the movement was a report from the central committee meeting of the CPSU titled \"On Reorganization and the Party's Personnel Policy\". This report was in such high demand in Prague and Berlin that many people could not get a copy. One effect was the abrupt demand for Russian dictionaries in order to understand the content of Gorbachev's report.The biggest weapon used during Perestroika was Glasnost as a Political Weapon. For the last fifty years, the USSR was a bureaucracy that needed restructuring and Gorbachev saw it needed to shift towards conservative. It was said that the theory of glasnost is perceived as being Leninist, in reference to Leninist socialism. In an interview with Miezeslaw Rakowski he states the success of perestroika was impossible without glasnost.\n\n\n== The role of the West in Perestroika ==\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s the United States President George H. W. Bush pledged solidarity with Gorbachev, but never brought his administration into supporting Gorbachev's reform. In fact, \"no bailout for Gorbachev\" was a consistent policy line of the Bush Administration, further demonstrating the lack of true support from the West. President Bush had a financial policy to aid perestroika that was shaped by a minimalist approach, foreign-policy convictions that set Bush up against other U.S. internal affairs, and a frugal attitude, all influencing his unwillingness to aid Gorbachev. Other factors influenced the West's lack of aid as well like \"the in-house Gorbi-skeptics\" advocacy, the expert community's consensus about the undesirability of rushing U.S. aid to Gorbachev, and strong opposition to any bailout at many levels, including foreign-policy conservatives, the U.S. Congress, and the American public at large. The West seemed to miss an opportunity to gain significant influence over the Soviet regime. The Soviets aided in the expansion of Western capitalism to allow for an inflow of Western investments, but the perestroika managers failed. President Bush had the opportunity to aid the Soviet Union in a way to bring closer ties between the governments, like Harry S. Truman did for many nations in Western Europe. Early on, as perestroika was getting under way, I felt like the West might come along and find it a sensible thing to do\u2014easing Russia's difficult transition from totalitarianism to democracy. What I had in mind in the first place, was the participation [of the West] in conversion of defense industries, the modernization of light and food industries, and Russia's inclusion on an equal-member footing in the frameworks of the international economic relations... [U]nlike some democrats, I did not expect \"manna from Heaven,\" but counted on the Western statesmen to use their common sense.President George H.W. Bush continued to dodge helping the Russians and the President of Czechoslovakia, Vaclav Havel, laid bare the linkage for the Americans in his address to a joint session of Congress on February 21, 1990: ... I often hear the question: How can the United States of America help us today? My reply is as paradoxical as the whole of my life has been: You can help us most of all if you help the Soviet Union on its irreversible, but immensely complicated road to democracy....[T]he sooner, the more quickly, and the more peacefully the Soviet Union begins to move along the road toward genuine political pluralism, respect for the rights of nations to their own integrity and to a working\u2014that is a market\u2014economy, the better it will be, not just for Czechs and Slovaks, but for the whole world.\nWhen the United States needed help with Germany's reunification, Gorbachev proved to be instrumental in bringing solutions to the \"German problem\" and Bush acknowledged that \"Gorbachev was moving the USSR in the right direction\". Bush, in his own words, even gave praise to Gorbachev \"to salute the man\" in acknowledgment of the Soviet leader's role as \"the architect of perestroika... [who had] conducted the affairs of the Soviet Union with great restraint as Poland and Czechoslovakia and GDR... and other countries [that had] achieved their independence\", and who was \"under extraordinary pressure at home, particularly on the economy.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nMikhail Gorbachev on perestroika\nChris Harman & Andy Zebrowski.

Perestroika and its associated structural ailments have been cited as major catalysts leading to the dissolution of the Soviet Union.Perestroika is sometimes argued to be a significant cause of the collapse of the Eastern Bloc and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which marked the end of the Cold War."}, "Rastokhez": {"links": ["Boris Yeltsin", "Social Democratic Party ", "Economic liberalization", "Milo\u0161 Jake\u0161", "History of Kazakhstan", "History of Tajikistan", "Pan-European Picnic", "Yemeni unification", "Communist Party of Tajikistan", "Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia", "History of Russia ", "Democratic Party of Albania", "Fall of the inner German border", "Isaias Afwerki", "Tajikistani Civil War", "Afghan Civil War ", "Tochikistoni Ozod", "Reagan Doctrine", "Mongolian Revolution of one thousand, nine hundred and ninety", "Colour revolution", "Holy See\u2013Soviet Union relations", "Transnistria War", "Agrarian Party ", "Helsinki Summit ", "Wang Dan ", "Union of Democratic Forces ", "Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan", "Erich Honecker", "Neo-Stalinism", "Political party", "Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu", "Denis Sassou Nguesso", "Party of National Unity of Tajikistan", "one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one Ukrainian independence referendum", "Vytautas Landsbergis", "Meles Zenawi", "People's Republic of Benin", "Solidarity ", "Alexanderplatz demonstration", "Ethiopian Civil War", "People's Democratic Party of Tajikistan", "People's Movement of Ukraine", "The Barricades", "Terrorism and the Soviet Union", "Civil resistance", "Socialist Party of Tajikistan", "one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt", "Warsaw Pact", "one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one Armenian independence referendum", "Totalitarianism", "January Events ", "Liu Gang", "Congress of Constructive Forces of Tajikistan", "Post-communism", "Mengistu Haile Mariam", "Active measures", "Democratic Russia", "Magnitizdat", "Wojciech Jaruzelski", "five hundred Days", "Deng Xiaoping", "National Salvation Front ", "Eastern Bloc media and propaganda", "Yugoslav Wars", "April nine tragedy", "eight thousand, eight hundred and eighty-eight Uprising", "Monday demonstrations in East Germany", "Lustration", "Pope John Paul II", "National League for Democracy", "Popular Front of Estonia", "United Tajik Opposition", "Belarusian Popular Front", "Post-Soviet conflicts", "Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa", "Romanian Revolution", "Anti-communism", "Emigration from the Eastern Bloc", "Human chain ", "Feng Congde", "Zianon Pazniak", "Nationalism", "Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation", "Samizdat", "George H.

Zhelev was one of the most prominent figures of the 1989 Bulgarian Revolution, which ended the 35 year rule of President Todor Zhivkov. A member of the Union of Democratic Forces, he was elected as President by the 7th Grand National Assembly. Two years later, he won Bulgaria's first direct presidential elections. He lost his party's nomination for his 1996 reelection campaign after losing a tough primary race to Petar Stoyanov.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nZhelyu Zhelev was born on 3 March 1935 in Veselinovo village, Shumen. He graduated with a degree in philosophy from the Sofia University \"St. Kliment Ohridski\" in 1958, and later earned a Ph.D. in 1974.\n\n\n=== Dissident ===\nZhelev was a member of the Bulgarian Communist Party, but was expelled from it for political reasons in 1965. He was unemployed for six years since all employment in Bulgaria was state-regulated.In 1982, he published his controversial work, \"The Fascism\" (\u0424\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0437\u043c\u044a\u0442). Three weeks after the volume's publication in 1982, the book was removed from bookstores and libraries throughout the nation, as its description of the fascist states of Italy, Germany and Spain before, during, and after World War II made these regimes comparable to the Communist regimes in the Eastern block.\n\n\n=== SDS ===\nIn 1988, just before the Fall of Communism, Zhelev founded the Ruse Committee, and in 1989 he became a founding member and chairman of the Club for Support of Openness and the Reform (a time when many such democratic clubs were formed), which helped him to achieve the position of Chairman of the Coordinating Council of the Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgarian: \u0421\u0414\u0421, SDS) party.\n\n\n=== MP and President ===\nZhelev was elected MP in June 1990 for the 7th Grand National Assembly; the Assembly's main goal was to create a new democratic Constitution of Bulgaria. After the resignation of President Petar Mladenov, the assembly elected Zhelev his successor on 1 August 1990. He thus became the first head of state in 44 years who was not either a Communist or fellow traveler.\n\n\n=== 1992 presidential election ===\nUnder the new constitution adopted in July 1991, the president was to be elected directly by voters, for a maximum of two terms. The first such election was held in January 1992. Zhelev led the field in the first round, held on 12 January. He then won in the runoff a week later against Velko Valkanov (who was endorsed by the Socialists) with 52.8% of the votes to become Bulgaria's first directly elected head of state. He immediately suspended his membership in the UDF; the new constitution did not allow the president to be a formal member of a political party during his term.\n\n\n=== 1996 presidential election ===\nZhelev sought a second term in 1996, but lost the UDF nomination to eventual winner Petar Stoyanov.\n\n\n=== Later political career ===\nAfter his defeat in the 1996 UDF primaries and after the end of his presidency in 1997, Zhelev remained in politics, but on a much smaller scale. He became Honorary Chair of the Liberal Democratic Union and Honorary Chair of the Liberal International and in 1997 went on to establish and preside over a foundation named after him. Zhelev was the initiator and president of the Balkan Political Club, a union of former political leaders from Southeast Europe. As part of the club he voiced his support for Turkey's accession to the European Union.In 2009, Zhelev also voiced his opinion that Bulgaria should adopt a presidential system based upon the French model: \"The country should have both prime minister and president, but the latter should be vested in far-reaching powers so that he may control the executive power\".Zhelev died in Sofia at the age of 79 on 30 January 2015.\n\n\n=== World Justice Project ===\nZhelyu Zhelev served as an Honorary Co-Chair for the World Justice Project (ABA).\n\n\n=== Awards and accolades ===\nOn 15 January 2010, Zhelev received the Macedonian state Order 8-September for his contribution to the recognition of the independence of the Republic of Macedonia from the former Yugoslavia.Zhelev Peak on Loubet Coast, Antarctica is named after Zhelyu Zhelev \"for his support for the Bulgarian Antarctic programme.\"\n\n\n== Family ==\nHe was married to Maria Zheleva (3 April 1942 \u2013 8 December 2013) and has two daughters Yordanka (1963\u20131993) and Stanka (born 1966).\nZhelev has two grandchildren from his daughter Stanka.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Zhelyu Zhelev \u2014 The dissident president\" at the Sofia Echo, by Ivan Vatahov, April 17, 2003 (retrieved January 27, 2010).\nThomas, Richard (15 February 2015). \"Zhelyu Zhelev: Dissident who fought the dictatorship in Bulgaria before becoming its first democratically elected head of state\".

In his 1924 PhD thesis, he postulated the wave nature of electrons and suggested that all matter has wave properties. This concept is known as the de Broglie hypothesis, an example of wave\u2013particle duality, and forms a central part of the theory of quantum mechanics.\nDe Broglie won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1929, after the wave-like behaviour of matter was first experimentally demonstrated in 1927.\nThe 1925 pilot-wave model, and the wave-like behaviour of particles discovered by de Broglie was used by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger in his formulation of wave mechanics. The pilot-wave model and interpretation was then abandoned, in favor of the quantum formalism, until 1952 when it was rediscovered and enhanced by David Bohm.Louis de Broglie was the sixteenth member elected to occupy seat 1 of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1944, and served as Perpetual Secretary of the French Academy of Sciences. De Broglie became the first high-level scientist to call for establishment of a multi-national laboratory, a proposal that led to the establishment of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN).\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Origin and education ===\n\nLouis de Broglie belonged to the famous aristocratic family of Broglie, whose representatives for several centuries occupied important military and political posts in France. The father of the future physicist, Louis-Alphonse-Victor, 5th duc de Broglie, was married to Pauline d\u2019Armaille, the granddaughter of the Napoleonic General Philippe Paul, comte de S\u00e9gur. They had five children; in addition to Louis, these are: Albertina (1872\u20131946), subsequently the Marquise de Lupp\u00e9; Maurice (1875\u20131960), subsequently a famous experimental physicist; Philip (1881\u20131890), who died two years before the birth of Louis, and Pauline, Comtesse de Pange (1888\u20131972), subsequently a famous writer. Louis was born in Dieppe, Seine-Maritime. As the youngest child in the family, Louis grew up in relative loneliness, read a lot, was fond of history, especially political. From early childhood, he had a good memory and could accurately read an excerpt from a theatrical production or give a complete list of ministers of the Third Republic of France. For him was predicted a great future as a statesman.De Broglie had intended a career in humanities, and received his first degree in history. Afterwards he turned his attention toward mathematics and physics and received a degree in physics.  With the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, he offered his services to the army in the development of radio communications.\n\n\n=== Military service ===\nAfter graduation, Louis de Broglie as a simple sapper joined the engineering forces to undergo compulsory service. It began at Fort Mont Val\u00e9rien, but soon, on the initiative of his brother, he was seconded to the Wireless Communications Service and worked on the Eiffel Tower, where the radio transmitter was located. Louis de Broglie remained in military service throughout the First World War, dealing with purely technical issues. In particular, together with L\u00e9on Brillouin and brother Maurice, he participated in establishing wireless communications with submarines. Prince Louis was demobilized in August 1919 with the rank of adjudant. Later, the scientist regretted that he had to spend about six years away from the fundamental problems of science that interested him.\n\n\n=== Scientific and pedagogical career ===\nHis 1924 thesis Recherches sur la th\u00e9orie des quanta (Research on the Theory of the Quanta) introduced his theory of electron waves. This included the wave\u2013particle duality theory of matter, based on the work of Max Planck and Albert Einstein on light. This research culminated in the de Broglie hypothesis stating that any moving particle or object had an associated wave. De Broglie thus created a new field in physics, the m\u00e9canique ondulatoire, or wave mechanics, uniting the physics of energy (wave) and matter (particle). For this he won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1929.\nIn his later career, de Broglie worked to develop a causal explanation of wave mechanics, in opposition to the wholly probabilistic models which dominate quantum mechanical theory; it was refined by David Bohm in the 1950s. The theory has since been known as the De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory.\nIn addition to strictly scientific work, de Broglie thought and wrote about the philosophy of science, including the value of modern scientific discoveries.\nDe Broglie became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences in 1933, and was the academy's perpetual secretary from 1942. He was asked to join Le Conseil de l'Union Catholique des Scientifiques Francais, but declined because he was non-religious.\nOn 12 October 1944, he was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, replacing mathematician \u00c9mile Picard. Because of the deaths and imprisonments of Acad\u00e9mie members during the occupation and other effects of the war, the Acad\u00e9mie was unable to meet the quorum of twenty members for his election; due to the exceptional circumstances, however, his unanimous election by the seventeen members present was accepted. In an event unique in the history of the Acad\u00e9mie, he was received as a member by his own brother Maurice, who had been elected in 1934. UNESCO awarded him the first Kalinga Prize in 1952 for his work in popularizing scientific knowledge, and he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society on 23 April 1953.\nLouis became the 7th duc de Broglie in 1960 upon the death without heir of his elder brother, Maurice, 6th duc de Broglie, also a physicist.\nIn 1961, he received the title of Knight of the Grand Cross in the L\u00e9gion d'honneur. De Broglie was awarded a post as counselor to the French High Commission of Atomic Energy in 1945 for his efforts to bring industry and science closer together. He established a center for applied mechanics at the Henri Poincar\u00e9 Institute, where research into optics, cybernetics, and atomic energy were carried out. He inspired the formation of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science and was an early member. His funeral was held 23 March 1987 at the Church of Saint-Pierre-de-Neuilly.Louis never married. When he died in Louveciennes, he was succeeded as duke by a distant cousin, Victor-Fran\u00e7ois, 8th duc de Broglie.\n\n\n== Scientific activity ==\n\n\n=== Physics of X-ray and photoelectric effect ===\nThe first works of Louis de Broglie (early 1920s) were performed in the laboratory of his older brother Maurice and dealt with the features of the photoelectric effect and the properties of x-rays. These publications examined the absorption of X-rays and described this phenomenon using the Bohr theory, applied quantum principles to the interpretation of photoelectron spectra, and gave a systematic classification of X-ray spectra. The studies of X-ray spectra were important for elucidating the structure of the internal electron shells of atoms (optical spectra are determined by the outer shells). Thus, the results of experiments conducted together with Alexandre Dauvillier, revealed the shortcomings of the existing schemes for the distribution of electrons in atoms; these difficulties were eliminated by Edmund Stoner. Another result was the elucidation of the insufficiency of the Sommerfeld formula for determining the position of lines in X-ray spectra; this discrepancy was eliminated after the discovery of the electron spin. In 1925 and 1926, Leningrad physicist Orest Khvolson nominated the de Broglie brothers for the Nobel Prize for their work in the field of X-rays.\n\n\n=== Matter and wave\u2013particle duality ===\n\nStudying the nature of X-ray radiation and discussing its properties with his brother Maurice, who considered these rays to be some kind of combination of waves and particles, contributed to Louis de Broglie's awareness of the need to build a theory linking particle and wave representations. In addition, he was familiar with the works (1919\u20131922) of Marcel Brillouin, which proposed a hydrodynamic model of an atom and attempted to relate it to the results of Bohr's theory. The starting point in the work of Louis de Broglie was the idea of A. Einstein about the quanta of light. In his first article on this subject, published in 1922, the French scientist considered blackbody radiation as a gas of light quanta and, using classical statistical mechanics, derived the Wien radiation law in the framework of such a representation. In his next publication, he tried to reconcile the concept of light quanta with the phenomena of interference and diffraction and came to the conclusion that it was necessary to associate a certain periodicity with quanta. In this case, light quanta were interpreted by him as relativistic particles of very small mass.It remained to extend the wave considerations to any massive particles, and in the summer of 1923 a decisive breakthrough occurred. De Broglie outlined his ideas in a short note \"Waves and quanta\" (French: Ondes et quanta, presented at a meeting of the Paris Academy of Sciences on September 10, 1923), which marked the beginning of the creation of wave mechanics. In this paper, the scientist suggested that a moving particle with energy E and velocity v is characterized by some internal periodic process with a frequency \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n        \n          /\n        \n        h\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E/h}\n  , where \n  \n    \n      \n        h\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h}\n   is Planck's constant. To reconcile these considerations, based on the quantum principle, with the ideas of special relativity, de Broglie was forced to associate a \"fictitious wave\" with a moving body, which propagates with the velocity \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          c\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          /\n        \n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle c^{2}/v}\n  . Such a wave, which later received the name phase, or de Broglie wave, in the process of body movement remains in phase with the internal periodic process. Having then examined the motion of an electron in a closed orbit, the scientist showed that the requirement for phase matching directly leads to the quantum Bohr-Sommerfeld condition, that is, to quantize the angular momentum. In the next two notes (reported at the meetings on September 24 and October 8, respectively), de Broglie came to the conclusion that the particle velocity is equal to the group velocity of phase waves, and the particle moves along the normal to surfaces of equal phase. In the general case, the trajectory of a particle can be determined using Fermat's principle (for waves) or the principle of least action (for particles), which indicates a connection between geometric optics and classical mechanics.This theory set the basis of wave mechanics. It was supported by Einstein, confirmed by the electron diffraction experiments of G P Thomson and Davisson and Germer, and generalized by the work of Schr\u00f6dinger.\nHowever, this generalization was statistical and was not approved of by de Broglie, who said \"that the particle must be the seat of an internal periodic movement and that it must move in a wave in order to remain in phase with it was ignored by the actual physicists [who are] wrong to consider a wave propagation without localization of the particle, which was quite contrary to my original ideas.\"\nFrom a philosophical viewpoint, this theory of matter-waves has contributed greatly to the ruin of the atomism of the past. Originally, de Broglie thought that real wave (i.e., having a direct physical interpretation) was associated with particles. In fact, the wave aspect of matter was formalized by a wavefunction defined by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which is a pure mathematical entity having a probabilistic interpretation, without the support of real physical elements. This wavefunction gives an appearance of wave behavior to matter, without making real physical waves appear. However, until the end of his life de Broglie returned to a direct and real physical interpretation of matter-waves, following the work of David Bohm. The de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory is today the only interpretation giving real status to matter-waves and representing the predictions of quantum theory.\n\n\n=== Conjecture of an internal clock of the electron ===\nIn his 1924 thesis, de Broglie conjectured that the electron has an internal clock that constitutes part of the mechanism by which a pilot wave guides a particle. Subsequently, David Hestenes has proposed a link to the zitterbewegung that was suggested by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger.While attempts at verifying the internal clock hypothesis and measuring clock frequency are so far not conclusive, recent experimental data is at least compatible with de Broglie's conjecture.\n\n\n=== Non-nullity and variability of mass ===\nAccording to de Broglie, the neutrino and the photon have rest masses that are non-zero, though very low. That a photon is not quite massless is imposed by the coherence of his theory. Incidentally, this rejection of the hypothesis of a massless photon enabled him to doubt the hypothesis of the expansion of the universe.\nIn addition, he believed that the true mass of particles is not constant, but variable, and that each particle can be represented as a thermodynamic machine equivalent to a cyclic integral of action.\n\n\n=== Generalization of the principle of least action ===\nIn the second part of his 1924 thesis, de Broglie used the equivalence of the mechanical principle of least action with Fermat's optical principle: \"Fermat's principle applied to phase waves is identical to Maupertuis' principle applied to the moving body; the possible dynamic trajectories of the moving body are identical to the possible rays of the wave.\" This equivalence had been pointed out by Hamilton a century earlier, and published by him around 1830, in an era where no experience gave proof of the fundamental principles of physics being involved in the description of atomic phenomena.\nUp to his final work, he appeared to be the physicist who most sought that dimension of action which Max Planck, at the beginning of the 20th century, had shown to be the only universal unity (with his dimension of entropy).\n\n\n=== Duality of the laws of nature ===\nFar from claiming to make \"the contradiction disappear\" which Max Born thought could be achieved with a statistical approach, de Broglie extended wave\u2013particle duality to all particles (and to crystals which revealed the effects of diffraction) and extended the principle of duality to the laws of nature.\nHis last work made a single system of laws from the two large systems of thermodynamics and of mechanics:\n\nWhen Boltzmann and his continuators developed their statistical interpretation of Thermodynamics, one could have considered Thermodynamics to be a complicated branch of Dynamics. But, with my actual ideas, it's Dynamics that appear to be a simplified branch of Thermodynamics. I think that, of all the ideas that I've introduced in quantum theory in these past years, it's that idea that is, by far, the most important and the most profound.\nThat idea seems to match the continuous\u2013discontinuous duality, since its dynamics could be the limit of its thermodynamics when transitions to continuous limits are postulated. It is also close to that of Leibniz, who posited the necessity of \"architectonic principles\" to complete the system of mechanical laws.\nHowever, according to him, there is less duality, in the sense of opposition, than synthesis (one is the limit of the other) and the effort of synthesis is constant according to him, like in his first formula, in which the first member pertains to mechanics and the second to optics:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        m\n        \n          c\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        h\n        \u03bd\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle mc^{2}=h\\nu }\n  \n\n\n=== Neutrino theory of light ===\n\nThis theory, which dates from 1934, introduces the idea that the photon is equivalent to the fusion of two Dirac neutrinos.\nIt shows that the movement of the center of gravity of these two particles obeys the Maxwell equations\u2014that implies that the neutrino and the photon both have rest masses that are non-zero, though very low.\n\n\n=== Hidden thermodynamics ===\nDe Broglie's final idea was the hidden thermodynamics of isolated particles. It is an attempt to bring together the three furthest principles of physics: the principles of Fermat, Maupertuis, and Carnot.\nIn this work, action becomes a sort of opposite to entropy, through an equation that relates the only two universal dimensions of the form:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              action\n            \n            h\n          \n        \n        =\n        \u2212\n        \n          \n            \n              entropy\n            \n            k\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {{\\text{action}} \\over h}=-{{\\text{entropy}} \\over k}}\n  As a consequence of its great impact, this theory brings back the uncertainty principle to distances around extrema of action, distances corresponding to reductions in entropy.\n\n\n== Honors and awards ==\n1929 Nobel Prize in Physics\n1929 Henri Poincar\u00e9 Medal\n1932 Albert I of Monaco Prize\n1938 Max Planck Medal\n1938 Fellow, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences\n1944 Fellow, Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise\n1952 Kalinga Prize\n1953 Fellow, Royal Society\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\nRecherches sur la th\u00e9orie des quanta (Researches on the quantum theory), Thesis, Paris, 1924, Ann. de Physique (10) 3, 22 (1925).\nIntroduction \u00e0 la physique des rayons X et gamma (Introduction to physics of X-rays and Gamma-rays), with Maurice de Broglie, Gauthier-Villars, 1928.\nOndes et mouvements (in French).

In his 1924 PhD thesis, he postulated the wave nature of electrons and suggested that all matter has wave properties. This concept is known as the de Broglie hypothesis, an example of wave\u2013particle duality, and forms a central part of the theory of quantum mechanics.\nDe Broglie won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1929, after the wave-like behaviour of matter was first experimentally demonstrated in 1927.\nThe 1925 pilot-wave model, and the wave-like behaviour of particles discovered by de Broglie was used by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger in his formulation of wave mechanics. The pilot-wave model and interpretation was then abandoned, in favor of the quantum formalism, until 1952 when it was rediscovered and enhanced by David Bohm.Louis de Broglie was the sixteenth member elected to occupy seat 1 of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1944, and served as Perpetual Secretary of the French Academy of Sciences. De Broglie became the first high-level scientist to call for establishment of a multi-national laboratory, a proposal that led to the establishment of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)."}, "Ivar_Giaever": {"links": ["John Bardeen", "Philipp Lenard", "Martinus J.

Giaever's share of the prize was specifically for his \"experimental discoveries regarding tunnelling phenomena in superconductors\".In 1975, he was elected as a member into the National Academy of Engineering for contributions in the discovery and elaboration of electron tunneling into superconductors.\nGiaever is a professor emeritus at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the president of the company Applied Biophysics.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nGiaever earned a degree in mechanical engineering from the Norwegian Institute of Technology in Trondheim in 1952. In 1954, he emigrated from Norway to Canada, where he was employed by the Canadian division of General Electric. He moved to the United States four years later, joining General Electric's Corporate Research and Development Center in Schenectady, New York, in 1958.  He has lived in Niskayuna, New York, since then, taking up US citizenship in 1964.  While working for General Electric, Giaever earned a Ph.D. degree at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1964.\n\n\n== The Nobel Prize ==\nThe work that led to Giaever's Nobel Prize was performed at General Electric in 1960. Following on Esaki's discovery of electron tunnelling in semiconductors in 1958, Giaever showed that tunnelling also took place in superconductors, demonstrating tunnelling through a very thin layer of oxide surrounded on both sides by metal in a superconducting or normal state. Giaever's experiments demonstrated the existence of an energy gap in superconductors, one of the most important predictions of the BCS theory of superconductivity, which had been developed in 1957.  Giaever's experimental demonstration of tunnelling in superconductors stimulated the theoretical physicist Brian Josephson to work on the phenomenon, leading to his prediction of the Josephson effect in 1962.  Esaki and Giaever shared half of the 1973 Nobel Prize, and Josephson received the other half.Giaever's research later in his career was mainly in the field of biophysics.  In 1969, he researched biophysics for a year as a fellow at Clare Hall, University of Cambridge, through a Guggenheim Fellowship, and he continued to work in this area after he returned to the US.He has co-signed a letter from over 70 Nobel laureate scientists to the Louisiana Legislature supporting the repeal of Louisiana\u2019s Louisiana Science Education Act.\n\n\n== Other prizes ==\nIn addition to the Nobel Prize, he has also been awarded the Oliver E. Buckley Prize by the American Physical Society in 1965, the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1966, and the Zworykin Award by the National Academy of Engineering in 1975.In 1985, he was awarded an honorary degree, doctor honoris causa, at the Norwegian Institute of Technology, later part of Norwegian University of Science and Technology.He is a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.\n\n\n== Global warming ==\nGiaever has repeatedly professed skepticism of global warming, calling it a \"new religion.\"On 13 September 2011, Giaever resigned from the American Physical Society over its official position. The APS Fellow noted: \"In the APS it is ok to discuss whether the mass of the proton changes over time and how a multi-universe behaves, but the evidence of global warming is incontrovertible?\"Giaever is currently a science advisor with American conservative and libertarian think tank The Heartland Institute.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nGiaever married his childhood sweetheart Inger Skramstad in 1952. They have four children: John, Anne, Guri and Trine. Giaever is an atheist.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\nGiaever, Ivar (1960). \"Energy Gap in Superconductors Measured by Electron Tunneling\".
