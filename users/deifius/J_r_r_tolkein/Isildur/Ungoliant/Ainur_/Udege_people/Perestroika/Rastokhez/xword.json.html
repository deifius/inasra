Zhelev was one of the most prominent figures of the 1989 Bulgarian Revolution, which ended the 35 year rule of President Todor Zhivkov. A member of the Union of Democratic Forces, he was elected as President by the 7th Grand National Assembly. Two years later, he won Bulgaria's first direct presidential elections. He lost his party's nomination for his 1996 reelection campaign after losing a tough primary race to Petar Stoyanov.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Early life ===\nZhelyu Zhelev was born on 3 March 1935 in Veselinovo village, Shumen. He graduated with a degree in philosophy from the Sofia University \"St. Kliment Ohridski\" in 1958, and later earned a Ph.D. in 1974.\n\n\n=== Dissident ===\nZhelev was a member of the Bulgarian Communist Party, but was expelled from it for political reasons in 1965. He was unemployed for six years since all employment in Bulgaria was state-regulated.In 1982, he published his controversial work, \"The Fascism\" (\u0424\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0437\u043c\u044a\u0442). Three weeks after the volume's publication in 1982, the book was removed from bookstores and libraries throughout the nation, as its description of the fascist states of Italy, Germany and Spain before, during, and after World War II made these regimes comparable to the Communist regimes in the Eastern block.\n\n\n=== SDS ===\nIn 1988, just before the Fall of Communism, Zhelev founded the Ruse Committee, and in 1989 he became a founding member and chairman of the Club for Support of Openness and the Reform (a time when many such democratic clubs were formed), which helped him to achieve the position of Chairman of the Coordinating Council of the Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgarian: \u0421\u0414\u0421, SDS) party.\n\n\n=== MP and President ===\nZhelev was elected MP in June 1990 for the 7th Grand National Assembly; the Assembly's main goal was to create a new democratic Constitution of Bulgaria. After the resignation of President Petar Mladenov, the assembly elected Zhelev his successor on 1 August 1990. He thus became the first head of state in 44 years who was not either a Communist or fellow traveler.\n\n\n=== 1992 presidential election ===\nUnder the new constitution adopted in July 1991, the president was to be elected directly by voters, for a maximum of two terms. The first such election was held in January 1992. Zhelev led the field in the first round, held on 12 January. He then won in the runoff a week later against Velko Valkanov (who was endorsed by the Socialists) with 52.8% of the votes to become Bulgaria's first directly elected head of state. He immediately suspended his membership in the UDF; the new constitution did not allow the president to be a formal member of a political party during his term.\n\n\n=== 1996 presidential election ===\nZhelev sought a second term in 1996, but lost the UDF nomination to eventual winner Petar Stoyanov.\n\n\n=== Later political career ===\nAfter his defeat in the 1996 UDF primaries and after the end of his presidency in 1997, Zhelev remained in politics, but on a much smaller scale. He became Honorary Chair of the Liberal Democratic Union and Honorary Chair of the Liberal International and in 1997 went on to establish and preside over a foundation named after him. Zhelev was the initiator and president of the Balkan Political Club, a union of former political leaders from Southeast Europe. As part of the club he voiced his support for Turkey's accession to the European Union.In 2009, Zhelev also voiced his opinion that Bulgaria should adopt a presidential system based upon the French model: \"The country should have both prime minister and president, but the latter should be vested in far-reaching powers so that he may control the executive power\".Zhelev died in Sofia at the age of 79 on 30 January 2015.\n\n\n=== World Justice Project ===\nZhelyu Zhelev served as an Honorary Co-Chair for the World Justice Project (ABA).\n\n\n=== Awards and accolades ===\nOn 15 January 2010, Zhelev received the Macedonian state Order 8-September for his contribution to the recognition of the independence of the Republic of Macedonia from the former Yugoslavia.Zhelev Peak on Loubet Coast, Antarctica is named after Zhelyu Zhelev \"for his support for the Bulgarian Antarctic programme.\"\n\n\n== Family ==\nHe was married to Maria Zheleva (3 April 1942 \u2013 8 December 2013) and has two daughters Yordanka (1963\u20131993) and Stanka (born 1966).\nZhelev has two grandchildren from his daughter Stanka.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Zhelyu Zhelev \u2014 The dissident president\" at the Sofia Echo, by Ivan Vatahov, April 17, 2003 (retrieved January 27, 2010).\nThomas, Richard (15 February 2015). \"Zhelyu Zhelev: Dissident who fought the dictatorship in Bulgaria before becoming its first democratically elected head of state\".

In his 1924 PhD thesis, he postulated the wave nature of electrons and suggested that all matter has wave properties. This concept is known as the de Broglie hypothesis, an example of wave\u2013particle duality, and forms a central part of the theory of quantum mechanics.\nDe Broglie won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1929, after the wave-like behaviour of matter was first experimentally demonstrated in 1927.\nThe 1925 pilot-wave model, and the wave-like behaviour of particles discovered by de Broglie was used by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger in his formulation of wave mechanics. The pilot-wave model and interpretation was then abandoned, in favor of the quantum formalism, until 1952 when it was rediscovered and enhanced by David Bohm.Louis de Broglie was the sixteenth member elected to occupy seat 1 of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1944, and served as Perpetual Secretary of the French Academy of Sciences. De Broglie became the first high-level scientist to call for establishment of a multi-national laboratory, a proposal that led to the establishment of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN).\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Origin and education ===\n\nLouis de Broglie belonged to the famous aristocratic family of Broglie, whose representatives for several centuries occupied important military and political posts in France. The father of the future physicist, Louis-Alphonse-Victor, 5th duc de Broglie, was married to Pauline d\u2019Armaille, the granddaughter of the Napoleonic General Philippe Paul, comte de S\u00e9gur. They had five children; in addition to Louis, these are: Albertina (1872\u20131946), subsequently the Marquise de Lupp\u00e9; Maurice (1875\u20131960), subsequently a famous experimental physicist; Philip (1881\u20131890), who died two years before the birth of Louis, and Pauline, Comtesse de Pange (1888\u20131972), subsequently a famous writer. Louis was born in Dieppe, Seine-Maritime. As the youngest child in the family, Louis grew up in relative loneliness, read a lot, was fond of history, especially political. From early childhood, he had a good memory and could accurately read an excerpt from a theatrical production or give a complete list of ministers of the Third Republic of France. For him was predicted a great future as a statesman.De Broglie had intended a career in humanities, and received his first degree in history. Afterwards he turned his attention toward mathematics and physics and received a degree in physics.  With the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, he offered his services to the army in the development of radio communications.\n\n\n=== Military service ===\nAfter graduation, Louis de Broglie as a simple sapper joined the engineering forces to undergo compulsory service. It began at Fort Mont Val\u00e9rien, but soon, on the initiative of his brother, he was seconded to the Wireless Communications Service and worked on the Eiffel Tower, where the radio transmitter was located. Louis de Broglie remained in military service throughout the First World War, dealing with purely technical issues. In particular, together with L\u00e9on Brillouin and brother Maurice, he participated in establishing wireless communications with submarines. Prince Louis was demobilized in August 1919 with the rank of adjudant. Later, the scientist regretted that he had to spend about six years away from the fundamental problems of science that interested him.\n\n\n=== Scientific and pedagogical career ===\nHis 1924 thesis Recherches sur la th\u00e9orie des quanta (Research on the Theory of the Quanta) introduced his theory of electron waves. This included the wave\u2013particle duality theory of matter, based on the work of Max Planck and Albert Einstein on light. This research culminated in the de Broglie hypothesis stating that any moving particle or object had an associated wave. De Broglie thus created a new field in physics, the m\u00e9canique ondulatoire, or wave mechanics, uniting the physics of energy (wave) and matter (particle). For this he won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1929.\nIn his later career, de Broglie worked to develop a causal explanation of wave mechanics, in opposition to the wholly probabilistic models which dominate quantum mechanical theory; it was refined by David Bohm in the 1950s. The theory has since been known as the De Broglie\u2013Bohm theory.\nIn addition to strictly scientific work, de Broglie thought and wrote about the philosophy of science, including the value of modern scientific discoveries.\nDe Broglie became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences in 1933, and was the academy's perpetual secretary from 1942. He was asked to join Le Conseil de l'Union Catholique des Scientifiques Francais, but declined because he was non-religious.\nOn 12 October 1944, he was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise, replacing mathematician \u00c9mile Picard. Because of the deaths and imprisonments of Acad\u00e9mie members during the occupation and other effects of the war, the Acad\u00e9mie was unable to meet the quorum of twenty members for his election; due to the exceptional circumstances, however, his unanimous election by the seventeen members present was accepted. In an event unique in the history of the Acad\u00e9mie, he was received as a member by his own brother Maurice, who had been elected in 1934. UNESCO awarded him the first Kalinga Prize in 1952 for his work in popularizing scientific knowledge, and he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society on 23 April 1953.\nLouis became the 7th duc de Broglie in 1960 upon the death without heir of his elder brother, Maurice, 6th duc de Broglie, also a physicist.\nIn 1961, he received the title of Knight of the Grand Cross in the L\u00e9gion d'honneur. De Broglie was awarded a post as counselor to the French High Commission of Atomic Energy in 1945 for his efforts to bring industry and science closer together. He established a center for applied mechanics at the Henri Poincar\u00e9 Institute, where research into optics, cybernetics, and atomic energy were carried out. He inspired the formation of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science and was an early member. His funeral was held 23 March 1987 at the Church of Saint-Pierre-de-Neuilly.Louis never married. When he died in Louveciennes, he was succeeded as duke by a distant cousin, Victor-Fran\u00e7ois, 8th duc de Broglie.\n\n\n== Scientific activity ==\n\n\n=== Physics of X-ray and photoelectric effect ===\nThe first works of Louis de Broglie (early 1920s) were performed in the laboratory of his older brother Maurice and dealt with the features of the photoelectric effect and the properties of x-rays. These publications examined the absorption of X-rays and described this phenomenon using the Bohr theory, applied quantum principles to the interpretation of photoelectron spectra, and gave a systematic classification of X-ray spectra. The studies of X-ray spectra were important for elucidating the structure of the internal electron shells of atoms (optical spectra are determined by the outer shells). Thus, the results of experiments conducted together with Alexandre Dauvillier, revealed the shortcomings of the existing schemes for the distribution of electrons in atoms; these difficulties were eliminated by Edmund Stoner. Another result was the elucidation of the insufficiency of the Sommerfeld formula for determining the position of lines in X-ray spectra; this discrepancy was eliminated after the discovery of the electron spin. In 1925 and 1926, Leningrad physicist Orest Khvolson nominated the de Broglie brothers for the Nobel Prize for their work in the field of X-rays.\n\n\n=== Matter and wave\u2013particle duality ===\n\nStudying the nature of X-ray radiation and discussing its properties with his brother Maurice, who considered these rays to be some kind of combination of waves and particles, contributed to Louis de Broglie's awareness of the need to build a theory linking particle and wave representations. In addition, he was familiar with the works (1919\u20131922) of Marcel Brillouin, which proposed a hydrodynamic model of an atom and attempted to relate it to the results of Bohr's theory. The starting point in the work of Louis de Broglie was the idea of A. Einstein about the quanta of light. In his first article on this subject, published in 1922, the French scientist considered blackbody radiation as a gas of light quanta and, using classical statistical mechanics, derived the Wien radiation law in the framework of such a representation. In his next publication, he tried to reconcile the concept of light quanta with the phenomena of interference and diffraction and came to the conclusion that it was necessary to associate a certain periodicity with quanta. In this case, light quanta were interpreted by him as relativistic particles of very small mass.It remained to extend the wave considerations to any massive particles, and in the summer of 1923 a decisive breakthrough occurred. De Broglie outlined his ideas in a short note \"Waves and quanta\" (French: Ondes et quanta, presented at a meeting of the Paris Academy of Sciences on September 10, 1923), which marked the beginning of the creation of wave mechanics. In this paper, the scientist suggested that a moving particle with energy E and velocity v is characterized by some internal periodic process with a frequency \n  \n    \n      \n        E\n        \n          /\n        \n        h\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E/h}\n  , where \n  \n    \n      \n        h\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h}\n   is Planck's constant. To reconcile these considerations, based on the quantum principle, with the ideas of special relativity, de Broglie was forced to associate a \"fictitious wave\" with a moving body, which propagates with the velocity \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          c\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          /\n        \n        v\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle c^{2}/v}\n  . Such a wave, which later received the name phase, or de Broglie wave, in the process of body movement remains in phase with the internal periodic process. Having then examined the motion of an electron in a closed orbit, the scientist showed that the requirement for phase matching directly leads to the quantum Bohr-Sommerfeld condition, that is, to quantize the angular momentum. In the next two notes (reported at the meetings on September 24 and October 8, respectively), de Broglie came to the conclusion that the particle velocity is equal to the group velocity of phase waves, and the particle moves along the normal to surfaces of equal phase. In the general case, the trajectory of a particle can be determined using Fermat's principle (for waves) or the principle of least action (for particles), which indicates a connection between geometric optics and classical mechanics.This theory set the basis of wave mechanics. It was supported by Einstein, confirmed by the electron diffraction experiments of G P Thomson and Davisson and Germer, and generalized by the work of Schr\u00f6dinger.\nHowever, this generalization was statistical and was not approved of by de Broglie, who said \"that the particle must be the seat of an internal periodic movement and that it must move in a wave in order to remain in phase with it was ignored by the actual physicists [who are] wrong to consider a wave propagation without localization of the particle, which was quite contrary to my original ideas.\"\nFrom a philosophical viewpoint, this theory of matter-waves has contributed greatly to the ruin of the atomism of the past. Originally, de Broglie thought that real wave (i.e., having a direct physical interpretation) was associated with particles. In fact, the wave aspect of matter was formalized by a wavefunction defined by the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which is a pure mathematical entity having a probabilistic interpretation, without the support of real physical elements. This wavefunction gives an appearance of wave behavior to matter, without making real physical waves appear. However, until the end of his life de Broglie returned to a direct and real physical interpretation of matter-waves, following the work of David Bohm. The de Broglie\u2013Bohm theory is today the only interpretation giving real status to matter-waves and representing the predictions of quantum theory.\n\n\n=== Conjecture of an internal clock of the electron ===\nIn his 1924 thesis, de Broglie conjectured that the electron has an internal clock that constitutes part of the mechanism by which a pilot wave guides a particle. Subsequently, David Hestenes has proposed a link to the zitterbewegung that was suggested by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger.While attempts at verifying the internal clock hypothesis and measuring clock frequency are so far not conclusive, recent experimental data is at least compatible with de Broglie's conjecture.\n\n\n=== Non-nullity and variability of mass ===\nAccording to de Broglie, the neutrino and the photon have rest masses that are non-zero, though very low. That a photon is not quite massless is imposed by the coherence of his theory. Incidentally, this rejection of the hypothesis of a massless photon enabled him to doubt the hypothesis of the expansion of the universe.\nIn addition, he believed that the true mass of particles is not constant, but variable, and that each particle can be represented as a thermodynamic machine equivalent to a cyclic integral of action.\n\n\n=== Generalization of the principle of least action ===\nIn the second part of his 1924 thesis, de Broglie used the equivalence of the mechanical principle of least action with Fermat's optical principle: \"Fermat's principle applied to phase waves is identical to Maupertuis' principle applied to the moving body; the possible dynamic trajectories of the moving body are identical to the possible rays of the wave.\" This equivalence had been pointed out by Hamilton a century earlier, and published by him around 1830, in an era where no experience gave proof of the fundamental principles of physics being involved in the description of atomic phenomena.\nUp to his final work, he appeared to be the physicist who most sought that dimension of action which Max Planck, at the beginning of the 20th century, had shown to be the only universal unity (with his dimension of entropy).\n\n\n=== Duality of the laws of nature ===\nFar from claiming to make \"the contradiction disappear\" which Max Born thought could be achieved with a statistical approach, de Broglie extended wave\u2013particle duality to all particles (and to crystals which revealed the effects of diffraction) and extended the principle of duality to the laws of nature.\nHis last work made a single system of laws from the two large systems of thermodynamics and of mechanics:\n\nWhen Boltzmann and his continuators developed their statistical interpretation of Thermodynamics, one could have considered Thermodynamics to be a complicated branch of Dynamics. But, with my actual ideas, it's Dynamics that appear to be a simplified branch of Thermodynamics. I think that, of all the ideas that I've introduced in quantum theory in these past years, it's that idea that is, by far, the most important and the most profound.\nThat idea seems to match the continuous\u2013discontinuous duality, since its dynamics could be the limit of its thermodynamics when transitions to continuous limits are postulated. It is also close to that of Leibniz, who posited the necessity of \"architectonic principles\" to complete the system of mechanical laws.\nHowever, according to him, there is less duality, in the sense of opposition, than synthesis (one is the limit of the other) and the effort of synthesis is constant according to him, like in his first formula, in which the first member pertains to mechanics and the second to optics:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        m\n        \n          c\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        h\n        \u03bd\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle mc^{2}=h\\nu }\n  \n\n\n=== Neutrino theory of light ===\n\nThis theory, which dates from 1934, introduces the idea that the photon is equivalent to the fusion of two Dirac neutrinos.\nIt shows that the movement of the center of gravity of these two particles obeys the Maxwell equations\u2014that implies that the neutrino and the photon both have rest masses that are non-zero, though very low.\n\n\n=== Hidden thermodynamics ===\nDe Broglie's final idea was the hidden thermodynamics of isolated particles. It is an attempt to bring together the three furthest principles of physics: the principles of Fermat, Maupertuis, and Carnot.\nIn this work, action becomes a sort of opposite to entropy, through an equation that relates the only two universal dimensions of the form:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              action\n            \n            h\n          \n        \n        =\n        \u2212\n        \n          \n            \n              entropy\n            \n            k\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {{\\text{action}} \\over h}=-{{\\text{entropy}} \\over k}}\n  As a consequence of its great impact, this theory brings back the uncertainty principle to distances around extrema of action, distances corresponding to reductions in entropy.\n\n\n== Honors and awards ==\n1929 Nobel Prize in Physics\n1929 Henri Poincar\u00e9 Medal\n1932 Albert I of Monaco Prize\n1938 Max Planck Medal\n1938 Fellow, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences\n1944 Fellow, Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise\n1952 Kalinga Prize\n1953 Fellow, Royal Society\n\n\n== Publications ==\n\nRecherches sur la th\u00e9orie des quanta (Researches on the quantum theory), Thesis, Paris, 1924, Ann. de Physique (10) 3, 22 (1925).\nIntroduction \u00e0 la physique des rayons X et gamma (Introduction to physics of X-rays and Gamma-rays), with Maurice de Broglie, Gauthier-Villars, 1928.\nOndes et mouvements (in French).

In his 1924 PhD thesis, he postulated the wave nature of electrons and suggested that all matter has wave properties. This concept is known as the de Broglie hypothesis, an example of wave\u2013particle duality, and forms a central part of the theory of quantum mechanics.\nDe Broglie won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1929, after the wave-like behaviour of matter was first experimentally demonstrated in 1927.\nThe 1925 pilot-wave model, and the wave-like behaviour of particles discovered by de Broglie was used by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger in his formulation of wave mechanics. The pilot-wave model and interpretation was then abandoned, in favor of the quantum formalism, until 1952 when it was rediscovered and enhanced by David Bohm.Louis de Broglie was the sixteenth member elected to occupy seat 1 of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1944, and served as Perpetual Secretary of the French Academy of Sciences. De Broglie became the first high-level scientist to call for establishment of a multi-national laboratory, a proposal that led to the establishment of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)."}, "Ivar_Giaever": {"links": ["John Bardeen", "Philipp Lenard", "Martinus J.

Giaever's share of the prize was specifically for his \"experimental discoveries regarding tunnelling phenomena in superconductors\".In 1975, he was elected as a member into the National Academy of Engineering for contributions in the discovery and elaboration of electron tunneling into superconductors.\nGiaever is a professor emeritus at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the president of the company Applied Biophysics.\n\n\n== Early life ==\nGiaever earned a degree in mechanical engineering from the Norwegian Institute of Technology in Trondheim in 1952. In 1954, he emigrated from Norway to Canada, where he was employed by the Canadian division of General Electric. He moved to the United States four years later, joining General Electric's Corporate Research and Development Center in Schenectady, New York, in 1958.  He has lived in Niskayuna, New York, since then, taking up US citizenship in 1964.  While working for General Electric, Giaever earned a Ph.D. degree at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1964.\n\n\n== The Nobel Prize ==\nThe work that led to Giaever's Nobel Prize was performed at General Electric in 1960. Following on Esaki's discovery of electron tunnelling in semiconductors in 1958, Giaever showed that tunnelling also took place in superconductors, demonstrating tunnelling through a very thin layer of oxide surrounded on both sides by metal in a superconducting or normal state. Giaever's experiments demonstrated the existence of an energy gap in superconductors, one of the most important predictions of the BCS theory of superconductivity, which had been developed in 1957.  Giaever's experimental demonstration of tunnelling in superconductors stimulated the theoretical physicist Brian Josephson to work on the phenomenon, leading to his prediction of the Josephson effect in 1962.  Esaki and Giaever shared half of the 1973 Nobel Prize, and Josephson received the other half.Giaever's research later in his career was mainly in the field of biophysics.  In 1969, he researched biophysics for a year as a fellow at Clare Hall, University of Cambridge, through a Guggenheim Fellowship, and he continued to work in this area after he returned to the US.He has co-signed a letter from over 70 Nobel laureate scientists to the Louisiana Legislature supporting the repeal of Louisiana\u2019s Louisiana Science Education Act.\n\n\n== Other prizes ==\nIn addition to the Nobel Prize, he has also been awarded the Oliver E. Buckley Prize by the American Physical Society in 1965, the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1966, and the Zworykin Award by the National Academy of Engineering in 1975.In 1985, he was awarded an honorary degree, doctor honoris causa, at the Norwegian Institute of Technology, later part of Norwegian University of Science and Technology.He is a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters.\n\n\n== Global warming ==\nGiaever has repeatedly professed skepticism of global warming, calling it a \"new religion.\"On 13 September 2011, Giaever resigned from the American Physical Society over its official position. The APS Fellow noted: \"In the APS it is ok to discuss whether the mass of the proton changes over time and how a multi-universe behaves, but the evidence of global warming is incontrovertible?\"Giaever is currently a science advisor with American conservative and libertarian think tank The Heartland Institute.\n\n\n== Personal life ==\nGiaever married his childhood sweetheart Inger Skramstad in 1952.
