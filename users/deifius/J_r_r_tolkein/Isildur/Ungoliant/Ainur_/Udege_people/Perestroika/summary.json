"Perestroika (; Russian: \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0301\u0439\u043a\u0430; Ukrainian: \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430, romanized: Perebudova) was a political movement for reformation within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union during the 1980s widely associated with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and his glasnost (meaning \"openness\") policy reform. The literal meaning of perestroika is \"restructuring\", referring to the restructuring of the Soviet political and economic system, in an attempt to end the Brezhnev Stagnation.\nPerestroika allowed more independent actions from various ministries and introduced many market-like reforms. The alleged goal of perestroika, however, was not to end the command economy but rather to make socialism work more efficiently to better meet the needs of Soviet citizens by adopting elements of liberal economics. The process of implementing perestroika created shortages, political, social, and economic tensions within the Soviet Union and is often blamed for the political ascent of nationalism and nationalist political parties in the constituent republics. Perestroika and its associated structural ailments have been cited as major catalysts leading to the dissolution of the Soviet Union.Perestroika is sometimes argued to be a significant cause of the collapse of the Eastern Bloc and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, which marked the end of the Cold War."
