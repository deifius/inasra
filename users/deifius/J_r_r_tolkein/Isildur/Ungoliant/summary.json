"Ungoliant (Sindarin pronunciation: /\u028a\u014b.g\u0254l.jant/) is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium, described as an evil spirit in the form of a spider. She is mentioned briefly in The Lord of the Rings, and plays a supporting role in The Silmarillion. Her origins are unclear, as Tolkien's writings do not explicitly reveal her nature, other than that she is from \"before the world\". She is one of a few instances, along with Tom Bombadil and the Cats of Queen Ber\u00fathiel, where Tolkien does not provide a clear background for an element of his fiction."
