"Onomatopoeia (also onomatopeia in American English), is the process of creating a word that phonetically imitates, resembles, or suggests the sound that it describes. Such a word itself is also called an onomatopoeia. Common onomatopoeias include animal noises such as oink, meow (or miaow), roar and chirp. Onomatopoeia can differ between languages: it conforms to some extent to the broader linguistic system; hence the sound of a clock may be expressed as tick tock in English, tic tac in Spanish and Italian (shown in the picture), d\u012b d\u0101 in Mandarin, katchin katchin in Japanese, or tik-tik in Hindi.\nAlthough in the English language the term onomatopoeia means 'the imitation of a sound', the compound word onomatopoeia (\u1f40\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03af\u03b1) in the Greek language means 'making or creating names'. For words that imitate sounds, the term \u1f74\u03c7\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc (\u0113chomim\u0113tico) or echomimetic) is used. The word \u1f74\u03c7\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc (\u0113chomim\u0113tico) derives from \u1f74\u03c7\u03ce, meaning 'echo' or 'sound', and \u03bc\u03b9\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc, meaning 'mimetic' or 'imitating'."
