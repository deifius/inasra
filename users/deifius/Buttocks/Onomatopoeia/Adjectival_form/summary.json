"In linguistics, an adjective (abbreviated adj) is a word that modifies a noun or noun phrase or describes its referent. Its semantic role is to change information given by the noun.\nTraditionally, adjectives have been considered one of the main parts of speech of the English language, although historically they were classed together with nouns. Certain words that usually had been classified as be adjectives, including the, this, my, etc., are today typically classed separately, as determiners."
