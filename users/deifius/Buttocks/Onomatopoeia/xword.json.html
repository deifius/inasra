Such a word itself is also called an onomatopoeia. Common onomatopoeias include animal noises such as oink, meow (or miaow), roar and chirp. Onomatopoeia can differ between languages: it conforms to some extent to the broader linguistic system; hence the sound of a clock may be expressed as tick tock in English, tic tac in Spanish and Italian (shown in the picture), d\u012b d\u0101 in Mandarin, katchin katchin in Japanese, or tik-tik in Hindi.\nAlthough in the English language the term onomatopoeia means 'the imitation of a sound', the compound word onomatopoeia (\u1f40\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03af\u03b1) in the Greek language means 'making or creating names'. For words that imitate sounds, the term \u1f74\u03c7\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc (\u0113chomim\u0113tico) or echomimetic) is used. The word \u1f74\u03c7\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc (\u0113chomim\u0113tico) derives from \u1f74\u03c7\u03ce, meaning 'echo' or 'sound', and \u03bc\u03b9\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc, meaning 'mimetic' or 'imitating'.\n\n\n== Uses ==\n\nIn the case of a frog croaking, the spelling may vary because different frog species around the world make different sounds: Ancient Greek brekekekex koax koax (only in Aristophanes' comic play The Frogs) probably for marsh frogs; English ribbit for species of frog found in North America; English verb croak for the common frog.Some other very common English-language examples are hiccup, zoom, bang, beep, moo, and splash. Machines and their sounds are also often described with onomatopoeia: honk or beep-beep for the horn of an automobile, and vroom or brum for the engine. In speaking of a mishap involving an audible arcing of electricity, the word zap is often used (and its use has been extended to describe non-auditory effects generally connoting the same sort of localized but thorough interference or destruction similar to that produced in short-circuit sparking).\nHuman sounds sometimes provide instances of onomatopoeia, as when mwah is used to represent a kiss.For animal sounds, words like quack (duck), moo (cow), bark or woof (dog), roar (lion), meow/miaow or purr (cat), cluck (chicken) and baa (sheep) are typically used in English (both as nouns and as verbs).\nSome languages flexibly integrate onomatopoeic words into their structure. This may evolve into a new word, up to the point that the process is no longer recognized as onomatopoeia. One example is the English word bleat for sheep noise: in medieval times it was pronounced approximately as blairt (but without an R-component), or blet with the vowel drawled, which more closely resembles a sheep noise than the modern pronunciation.\nAn example of the opposite case is cuckoo, which, due to continuous familiarity with the bird noise down the centuries, has kept approximately the same pronunciation as in Anglo-Saxon times and its vowels have not changed as they have in the word furrow.\nVerba dicendi ('words of saying') are a method of integrating onomatopoeic words and ideophones into grammar.\nSometimes, things are named from the sounds they make. In English, for example, there is the universal fastener which is named for the sound it makes: the zip (in the UK) or zipper (in the U.S.) Many birds are named after their calls, such as the bobwhite quail, the weero, the morepork, the killdeer, chickadees and jays, the cuckoo, the chiffchaff, the whooping crane, the whip-poor-will, and the kookaburra. In Tamil and Malayalam, the word for crow is kaakaa. This practice is especially common in certain languages such as M\u0101ori, and so in names of animals borrowed from these languages.\n\n\n=== Cross-cultural differences ===\nAlthough a particular sound is heard similarly by people of different cultures, it is often expressed through the use of different consonant strings in different languages. For example, the snip of a pair of scissors is cri-cri in Italian, riqui-riqui in Spanish, terre-terre or treque-treque in Portuguese, krits-krits in modern Greek, c\u00ebk-c\u00ebk in Albanian, and katr-katr in Hindi. Similarly, the \"honk\" of a car's horn is ba-ba (Han: \u53ed\u53ed) in Mandarin, tut-tut in French, pu-pu in Japanese, bbang-bbang in Korean, b\u00e6rt-b\u00e6rt in Norwegian, fom-fom in Portuguese and bim-bim in Vietnamese.\n\n\n=== Onomatopoeic effect without onomatopoeic words ===\nAn onomatopoeic effect can also be produced in a phrase or word string with the help of alliteration and consonance alone, without using any onomatopoeic words. The most famous example is the phrase \"furrow followed free\" in Samuel Taylor Coleridge's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. The words \"followed\" and \"free\" are not onomatopoeic in themselves, but in conjunction with \"furrow\" they reproduce the sound of ripples following in the wake of a speeding ship. Similarly, alliteration has been used in the line \"as the surf surged up the sun swept shore ...\" to recreate the sound of breaking waves in the poem \"I, She and the Sea\".\n\n\n== Comics and advertising ==\n\nComic strips and comic books make extensive use of onomatopoeia. Popular culture historian Tim DeForest noted the impact of writer-artist Roy Crane (1901\u20131977), the creator of Captain Easy and Buz Sawyer:\n\nIt was Crane who pioneered the use of onomatopoeic sound effects in comics, adding \"bam,\" \"pow\" and \"wham\" to what had previously been an almost entirely visual vocabulary. Crane had fun with this, tossing in an occasional \"ker-splash\" or \"lickety-wop\" along with what would become the more standard effects. Words as well as images became vehicles for carrying along his increasingly fast-paced storylines.In 2002, DC Comics introduced a villain named Onomatopoeia, an athlete, martial artist, and weapons expert, who often speaks pure sounds.\nAdvertising uses onomatopoeia for mnemonic purposes, so that consumers will remember their products, as in Alka-Seltzer's \"Plop, plop, fizz, fizz. Oh, what a relief it is!\" jingle, recorded in two different versions (big band and rock) by Sammy Davis, Jr.\nRice Krispies (US and UK) and Rice Bubbles (AU) make a \"snap, crackle, pop\" when one pours on milk. During the 1930s, the illustrator Vernon Grant developed Snap, Crackle and Pop as gnome-like mascots for the Kellogg Company.\nSounds appear in road safety advertisements: \"clunk click, every trip\" (click the seatbelt on after clunking the car door closed; UK campaign) or \"click, clack, front and back\" (click, clack of connecting the seat belts; AU campaign) or \"click it or ticket\" (click of the connecting seat belt, with the implied penalty of a traffic ticket for not using a seat belt; US DOT (Department of Transportation) campaign).\nThe sound of the container opening and closing gives Tic Tac its name.\n\n\n=== Manner imitation ===\n\nIn many of the world's languages, onomatopoeic-like words are used to describe phenomena beyond the purely auditive. Japanese often uses such words to describe feelings or figurative expressions about objects or concepts. For instance, Japanese barabara is used to reflect an object's state of disarray or separation, and shiiin is the onomatopoetic form of absolute silence (used at the time an English speaker might expect to hear the sound of crickets chirping or a pin dropping in a silent room, or someone coughing). In Albanian, tartarec is used to describe someone who is hasty. It is used in English as well with terms like bling, which describes the glinting of light on things like gold, chrome or precious stones. In Japanese, kirakira is used for glittery things.\n\n\n== Examples in media ==\nJames Joyce in Ulysses (1922) coined the onomatopoeic tattarrattat for a knock on the door. It is listed as the longest palindromic word in The Oxford English Dictionary.\nWhaam! (1963) by Roy Lichtenstein is an early example of pop art, featuring a reproduction of comic book art that depicts a fighter aircraft striking another with rockets with dazzling red and yellow explosions.\nIn the 1960s TV series Batman, comic book style onomatopoeic words such as wham!, pow!, biff!, crunch! and zounds! appear onscreen during fight scenes.\nUbisoft's XIII employed the use of comic book onomatopoeic words such as bam!, boom! and noooo! during gameplay for gunshots, explosions and kills, respectively. The comic-book style is apparent throughout the game and is a core theme, and the game is an adaptation of a comic book of the same name.\nThe chorus of American popular songwriter John Prine's song \"Onomatopoeia\" cleverly incorporates onomatopoeic words: \"Bang! went the pistol. | Crash! went the window. | Ouch! went the son of a gun. | Onomatopoeia | I don't wanna see ya | Speaking in a foreign tongue.\"\nThe marble game KerPlunk has an onomatopoeic word for a title, from the sound of marbles dropping when one too many sticks has been removed.\nThe Nickelodeon cartoon's title KaBlam! is implied to be onomatopoeic to a crash.\nEach episode of the TV series Harper's Island is given an onomatopoeic name which imitates the sound made in that episode when a character dies. For example, in the episode titled \"Bang\" a character is shot and fatally wounded, with the \"Bang\" mimicking the sound of the gunshot.\nMad Magazine cartoonist Don Martin, already popular for his exaggerated artwork, often employed comic-book style onomatopoeic sound effects in his drawings (for example, thwizzit is the sound of a sheet of paper being yanked from a typewriter). Fans have compiled The Don Martin Dictionary, cataloguing each sound and its meaning.\n\n\n== Cross-linguistic examples ==\n\n\n== In linguistics ==\nA key component of language is its arbitrariness and what a word can represent, as a word is a sound created by humans with attached meaning to said sound. No one can determine the meaning of a word purely by how it sounds. However, in onomatopoeic words, these sounds are much less arbitrary; they are connected in their imitation of other objects or sounds in nature. Vocal sounds in the imitation of natural sounds doesn't necessarily gain meaning, but can gain symbolic meaning. An example of this sound symbolism in the English language is the use of words starting with sn-. Some of these words symbolize concepts related to the nose (sneeze, snot, snore). This does not mean that all words with that sound relate to the nose, but at some level we recognize a sort of symbolism associated with the sound itself. Onomatopoeia, while a facet of language, is also in a sense outside of the confines of language.In linguistics, onomatopoeia is described as the connection, or symbolism, of a sound that is interpreted and reproduced within the context of a language, usually out of mimicry of a sound. It is a figure of speech, in a sense. Considered a vague term on its own, there are a few varying defining factors in classifying onomatopoeia. In one manner, it is defined simply as the imitation of some kind of non-vocal sound using the vocal sounds of a language, like the hum of a bee being imitated with a \"buzz\" sound. In another sense, it is described as the phenomena of making a new word entirely.\nOnomatopoeia works in the sense of symbolizing an idea in a phonological context, not necessarily constituting a direct meaningful word in the process. The symbolic properties of a sound in a word, or a phoneme, is related to a sound in an environment, and are restricted in part by a language's own phonetic inventory, hence why many languages can have distinct onomatopoeia for the same natural sound. Depending on a language's connection to a sound's meaning, that language's onomatopoeia inventory can differ proportionally. For example, a language like English generally holds little symbolic representation when it comes to sounds, which is the reason English tends to have a smaller representation of sound mimicry then a language like Japanese that overall has a much higher amount of symbolism related to the sounds of the language.\n\n\n== The evolution of language ==\nIn ancient Greek philosophy, onomatopoeia was used as evidence for how natural a language was: it was theorized that language itself was derived from natural sounds in the world around us. Symbolism in sounds was seen as deriving from this. Some linguists hold that onomatopoeia may have been the first form of human language.\n\n\n== Role in early language acquisition ==\nWhen first exposed to sound and communication, humans are biologically inclined to mimic the sounds they hear, whether they are actual pieces of language or other natural sounds. Early on in development, an infant will vary his/her utterances between sounds that are well established within the phonetic range of the language(s) most heavily spoken in their environment, which may be called \"tame\" onomatopoeia, and the full range of sounds that the vocal tract can produce, or \"wild\" onomatopoeia. As one begins to acquire one's first language, the proportion of \"wild\" onomatopoeia reduces in favor of sounds which are congruent with those of the language they are acquiring.\nDuring the native language acquisition period, it has been documented that infants may react strongly to the more wild-speech features to which they are exposed, compared to more tame and familiar speech features. But the results of such tests are inconclusive.\nIn the context of language acquisition, sound symbolism has been shown to play an important role. The association of foreign words to subjects and how they relate to general objects, such as the association of the words takete and baluma with either a round or angular shape, has been tested to see how languages symbolize sounds.\n\n\n== In other languages ==\n\n\n=== Japanese ===\n\nThe Japanese language has a large inventory of ideophone words that are symbolic sounds. These are used in contexts ranging from day to day conversation to serious news. These words fall into four categories:\n\nGiseigo: mimics humans and animals. (e.g. wanwan for a dog's bark)\nGiongo: mimics general noises in nature or inanimate objects. (e.g. zaazaa for rain on a roof)\nGitaigo: describes states of the external world\nGij\u014dgo: describes psychological states or bodily feelings.The two former correspond directly to the concept of onomatopoeia, while the two latter are similar to onomatopoeia in that they are intended to represent a concept mimetically and performatively rather than referentially, but different from onomatopoeia in that they aren't just imitative of sounds. For example, shiinto represents something being silent, just as how an anglophone might say \"clatter, crash, bang!\" to represent something being noisy. That \"representative\" or \"performative\" aspect is the similarity to onomatopoeia.\nSometimes Japanese onomatopoeia produces reduplicated words.\n\n\n=== Hebrew ===\nAs in Japanese, onomatopoeia in Hebrew sometimes produces reduplicated verbs:\n\u05e9\u05e7\u05e9\u05e7 shiksh\u00e9k \"to make noise, rustle\".\n\u05e8\u05e9\u05e8\u05e9 rishr\u00e9sh \"to make noise, rustle\".\n\n\n=== Malay ===\nThere is a documented correlation within the Malay language of onomatopoeia that begin with the sound bu- and the implication of something that is rounded, as well as with the sound of -lok within a word conveying curvature in such words like lok, kelok and telok ('locomotive', 'cove', and 'curve' respectively).\n\n\n=== Arabic ===\nThe Qur'an, written in Arabic, documents instances of onomatopoeia. Of about 77,701 words, there are nine words that are onomatopoeic: three are animal sounds (e.g., \"mooing\"), two are sounds of nature (e.g.; \"thunder\"), and four that are human sounds (e.g., \"whisper\" or \"groan\").\n\n\n=== Albanian ===\nThere is wide array of objects and animals in the Albanian language that have been named after the sound they produce. Such onomatopoeic words are shkrepse (matches), named after the distinct sound of friction and ignition of the match head; take-tuke (ashtray) mimicking the sound it makes when placed on a table; shi (rain) resembling the continuous sound of pouring rain; kukumja\u00e7k\u00eb (Little owl) after its \"cuckoo\" hoot; fur\u00e7\u00eb (brush) for its rustling sound; shapka (slippers and flip-flops); pordh\u00eb (loud flatulence) and f\u00ebnd\u00eb (silent flatulence).\n\n\n=== Urdu ===\nIn Urdu, onomatopoeic words like bak-bak, churh-churh are used to indicate silly talk. Other examples of onomatopoeic words being used to represent actions are fatafat (to do something fast), dhak-dhak (to represent fear with the sound of fast beating heart), tip-tip (to signify a leaky tap) etc. Movement of animals or objects is also sometimes represented with onomatopoeic words like bhin-bhin (for a housefly) and sar-sarahat (the sound of a cloth being dragged on or off a piece of furniture).\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== General references ===\nCrystal, David (1997).

Its semantic role is to change information given by the noun.\nTraditionally, adjectives have been considered one of the main parts of speech of the English language, although historically they were classed together with nouns. Certain words that usually had been classified as be adjectives, including the, this, my, etc., are today typically classed separately, as determiners.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nAdjective comes from Latin n\u014dmen adject\u012bvum, a calque of Ancient Greek: \u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03b8\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u1f44\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1, romanized: ep\u00edtheton \u00f3noma, lit.\u2009'additional noun'. In the grammatical tradition of Latin and Greek, because adjectives were inflected for gender, number, and case like nouns (a process called declension), they were considered a type of noun. The words that are today typically called nouns were then called substantive nouns (n\u014dmen substant\u012bvum). The terms noun substantive and noun adjective were formerly used in English but are now obsolete.\n\n\n== Types of use ==\nDepending on the language, an adjective can precede a corresponding noun on a prepositive basis or it can follow a corresponding noun on a postpositive basis. Structural, contextual, and style considerations can impinge on the pre-or post-position of an adjective in a given instance of its occurrence. In English, occurrences of adjectives generally can be classified into one of three categories:\n\nPrepositive adjectives, which are also known as \"attributive adjectives,\" occur on an antecedent basis within a noun phrase. For example: \"I put my  happy kids into the car,\" wherein happy occurs on an antecedent basis within the my happy kids noun phrase, and therefore functions in a prepositive adjective.\nPostpositive adjectives can occur: (a) immediately subsequent to a noun within a noun phrase, e.g. \"I took a short drive around with my happy kids;\" (b) as linked via a copula or other linking mechanism subsequent to a corresponding noun or pronoun; for example: \"My kids are happy,\" wherein happy is a predicate adjective  (see also: Predicative expression, Subject complement); or (c) as an appositive adjective within a noun phrase, e.g. \"My kids, [who are] happy to go cruising, are in the back seat.\"\nNominalized adjectives, which function as nouns. One way this happens is by eliding a noun from an adjective-noun noun phrase, whose remnant thus is a nominalization. In the sentence, \"I read two books to them; he preferred the sad book, but she preferred the happy\", happy is a nominalized adjective, short for \"happy one\" or \"happy book\". Another way this happens is in phrases like \"out with the old, in with the new\", where \"the old\" means \"that which is old\" or \"all that is old\", and similarly with \"the new\". In such cases, the adjective may function as a mass noun (as in the preceding example). In English, it may also function as a plural count noun denoting a collective group, as in \"The meek shall inherit the Earth\", where \"the meek\" means \"those who are meek\" or \"all who are meek\".\n\n\n== Distribution ==\nAdjectives feature as a part of speech (word class) in most languages. In some languages, the words that serve the semantic function of adjectives are categorized together with some other class, such as nouns or verbs. In the phrase \"a Ford car\", \"Ford\" is unquestionably a noun but its function is adjectival: to modify \"car\". In some languages adjectives can function as nouns: for example, the Spanish phrase \"uno rojo\" means \"a red [one]\".\nAs for \"confusion\" with verbs, rather than an adjective meaning \"big\", a language might have a verb that means \"to be big\" and could then use an attributive verb construction analogous to \"big-being house\" to express what in English is called a \"big house\". Such an analysis is possible for the grammar of Standard Chinese, for example.\nDifferent languages do not use adjectives in exactly the same situations. For example, where English uses \"to be hungry\" (hungry being an adjective), Dutch, French, and Spanish use \"honger hebben\", \"avoir faim\", and \"tener hambre\" respectively (literally \"to have hunger\", the words for \"hunger\" being nouns). Similarly, where Hebrew uses the adjective \u05d6\u05e7\u05d5\u05e7\u200e (zaq\u016bq, roughly \"in need of\"), English uses the verb \"to need\".\nIn languages that have adjectives as a word class, it is usually an open class; that is, it is relatively common for new adjectives to be formed via such processes as derivation. However, Bantu languages are well known for having only a small closed class of adjectives, and new adjectives are not easily derived. Similarly, native Japanese adjectives (i-adjectives) are considered a closed class (as are native verbs), although nouns (an open class) may be used in the genitive to convey some adjectival meanings, and there is also the separate open class of adjectival nouns (na-adjectives).\n\n\n== Adverbs ==\nMany languages (including English) distinguish between adjectives, which qualify nouns and pronouns, and adverbs, which mainly modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Not all languages make this exact distinction; many (including English) have words that can function as either. For example, in English, fast is an adjective in \"a fast car\" (where it qualifies the noun car) but an adverb in \"he drove fast\" (where it modifies the verb drove).\nIn Dutch and German, adjectives and adverbs are usually identical in form and many grammarians do not make the distinction, but patterns of inflection can suggest a difference:\n\nEine kluge neue Idee.\nA clever new idea.\nEine klug ausgereifte Idee.\nA cleverly developed idea.A German word like klug (\"clever(ly)\") takes endings when used as an attributive adjective but not when used adverbially. (It also takes no endings when used as a predicative adjective: er ist klug, \"he is clever\".) Whether these are distinct parts of speech or distinct usages of the same part of speech is a question of analysis. It can be noted that, while German linguistic terminology distinguishes adverbiale from adjektivische Formen, German refers to both as Eigenschaftsw\u00f6rter (\"property words\").\n\n\n== Determiners ==\n\nLinguists today distinguish determiners from adjectives, considering them to be two separate parts of speech (or lexical categories). But formerly determiners were considered to be adjectives in some of their uses. Determiners are words that are neither nouns nor pronouns, yet reference a thing already in context. They generally do this by indicating definiteness (a vs. the), quantity (one vs. some vs. many), or another such property.\n\n\n== Adjective phrases ==\n\nAn adjective acts as the head of an adjective phrase or adjectival phrase (AP). In the simplest case, an adjective phrase consists solely of the adjective; more complex adjective phrases may contain one or more adverbs modifying the adjective (\"very strong\"), or one or more complements (such as \"worth several dollars\", \"full of toys\", or \"eager to please\"). In English, attributive adjective phrases that include complements typically follow the noun that they qualify (\"an evildoer devoid of redeeming qualities\").\n\n\n== Other modifiers of nouns ==\nIn many languages (including English) it is possible for nouns to modify other nouns. Unlike adjectives, nouns acting as modifiers (called attributive nouns or noun adjuncts) usually are not predicative; a beautiful park is beautiful, but a car park is not \"car\". The modifier often indicates origin (\"Virginia reel\"), purpose (\"work clothes\"), semantic patient (\"man eater\") or semantic subject (\"child actor\"); however, it may generally indicate almost any semantic relationship. It is also common for adjectives to be derived from nouns, as in boyish, birdlike, behavioral (behavioural), famous, manly, angelic, and so on.\nIn Australian Aboriginal languages, the distinction between adjectives and nouns is typically thought weak, and many of the languages only use nouns--or nouns with a limited set of adjective-deriving affixes--to modify other nouns. In languages that have a subtle adjective-noun distinction, one way to tell them apart is that a modifying adjective can come to stand in for an entire elided noun phrase, while a modifying noun cannot. For example, in Bardi, the adjective moorrooloo 'little' in the phrase moorrooloo baawa \u2018little child\u2019 can stand on its own to mean 'the little one,' while the attributive noun aamba 'man' in the phrase aamba baawa 'male child' cannot stand for the whole phrase to mean 'the male one.' In other languages, like Warlpiri, nouns and adjectives are lumped together beneath the nominal umbrella because of their shared syntactic distribution as arguments of predicates. The only thing distinguishing them is that some nominals seem to semantically denote entities (typically nouns in English) and some nominals seem to denote attributes (typically adjectives in English).Many languages have special verbal forms called participles that can act as noun modifiers (alone or as the head of a phrase). Sometimes participles develop into pure adjectives. Examples in English include relieved (the past participle of the verb relieve, used as an adjective in sentences such as \"I am so relieved to see you\"), spoken (as in \"the spoken word\"), and going (the present participle of the verb go, used as an adjective in such phrases as \"the going rate\").\nOther constructs that often modify nouns include prepositional phrases (as in \"a rebel without a cause\"), relative clauses (as in \"the man who wasn't there\"), and infinitive phrases (as in \"a cake to die for\"). Some nouns can also take complements such as content clauses (as in \"the idea that I would do that\"), but these are not commonly considered modifiers. For more information about possible modifiers and dependents of nouns, see Components of noun phrases.\n\n\n== Order ==\nIn many languages, attributive adjectives usually occur in a specific order. In general, the adjective order in English can be summarised as: opinion, size, age or shape, colour, origin, material, purpose.  Other language authorities, like the Cambridge Dictionary, state that shape precedes rather than follows age.Determiners\u2014articles, numerals and other limiters (e.g. three blind mice)\u2014come before attributive adjectives in English. Although certain combinations of determiners can appear before a noun, they are far more circumscribed than adjectives in their use\u2014typically, only a single determiner would appear before a noun or noun phrase (including any attributive adjectives).\n\nQuantity - adjectives of number (e.g. two, ten)\nOpinion \u2013 limiter adjectives (e.g. a real hero, a perfect idiot) and adjectives of subjective measure (e.g. beautiful, interesting) or value (e.g. good, bad, costly)\nSize \u2013 adjectives denoting physical size (e.g. tiny, big, extensive)\nWeight - adjectives denoting weight (e.g. slim, fat, thin)\nAge \u2013 adjectives denoting age (e.g. young, old, new, ancient, six-year-old)\nTemperature - Adjectives denoting temperature (e.g. cold, warm, hot)\nHumidity - adjectives denoting humidity (e.g. dry, wet)\nShape \u2013 adjectives describing more detailed physical attributes than overall size (e.g. round, sharp, swollen)\nColour \u2013 adjectives denoting colour (e.g. white, black, pale)\nPattern - adjectives denoting pattern of colour (e.g. spotted, crackled)\nOrigin \u2013 denominal adjectives denoting source (e.g. French, volcanic, extraterrestrial)\nMaterial \u2013 denominal adjectives denoting what something is made of (e.g., woollen, metallic, wooden)\nQualifier/purpose \u2013 final limiter, which sometimes forms part of the (compound) noun (e.g., rocking chair, hunting cabin, passenger car, book cover)\nThis means that, in English, adjectives pertaining to size precede adjectives pertaining to age (\"little old\", not \"old little\"), which in turn generally precede adjectives pertaining to colour (\"old white\", not \"white old\"). So, one would say \"One (quantity) nice (opinion) little (size) old (age) round (shape) [or round old] white (colour) brick (material) house.\" When several adjectives of the same type are used together, they are ordered from general to specific, like \"lovely intelligent person\" or \"old medieval castle\".This order may be more rigid in some languages than others; in some, like Spanish, it may only be a default (unmarked) word order, with other orders being permissible. Other languages, such as Tagalog, follow their adjectival orders as rigidly as English.\nThe normal adjectival order of English may be overridden in certain circumstances, especially when one adjective is being fronted. For example, the usual order of adjectives in English would result in the phrase \"the bad big wolf\" (opinion before size), but instead, the usual phrase is \"the big bad wolf\".\nOwing partially to borrowings from French, English has some adjectives that follow the noun as postmodifiers, called postpositive adjectives, as in time immemorial and attorney general. Adjectives may even change meaning depending on whether they precede or follow, as in proper: They live in a proper town (a real town, not a village) vs. They live in the town proper (in the town itself, not in the suburbs). All adjectives can follow nouns in certain constructions, such as tell me something new.\n\n\n== Comparison (degrees) ==\n\nIn many languages, some adjectives are comparable and the measure of comparison is called degree. For example, a person may be \"polite\", but another person may be \"more polite\", and a third person may be the \"most polite\" of the three. The word \"more\" here modifies the adjective \"polite\" to indicate a comparison is being made, and \"most\" modifies the adjective to indicate an absolute comparison (a superlative).\nAmong languages that allow adjectives to be compared, different means are used to indicate comparison. Some languages do not distinguish between comparative and superlative forms. Other languages allow adjectives to be compared but do not have a special comparative form of the adjective. In such cases, as in some Australian Aboriginal languages, case-marking, such as the ablative case may be used to indicate one entity has more of an adjectival quality than  (i.e. from\u2014hence ABL) another. Take the following example in Bardi:\n\nIn English, many adjectives can be inflected to comparative and superlative forms by taking the suffixes \"-er\" and \"-est\" (sometimes requiring additional letters before the suffix; see forms for far below), respectively:\n\n\"great\", \"greater\", \"greatest\"\n\"deep\", \"deeper\", \"deepest\"Some adjectives are irregular in this sense:\n\n\"good\", \"better\", \"best\"\n\"bad\", \"worse\", \"worst\"\n\"many\", \"more\", \"most\" (sometimes regarded as an adverb or determiner)\n\"little\", \"less\", \"least\"Some adjectives can have both regular and irregular variations:\n\n\"old\", \"older\", \"oldest\"\n\"far\", \"farther\", \"farthest\"also\n\n\"old\", \"elder\", \"eldest\"\n\"far\", \"further\", \"furthest\"Another way to convey comparison is by incorporating the words \"more\" and \"most\". There is no simple rule to decide which means is correct for any given adjective, however. The general tendency is for simpler adjectives and those from Anglo-Saxon to take the suffixes, while longer adjectives and those from French, Latin, or Greek do not\u2014but sometimes sound of the word is the deciding factor.\nMany adjectives do not naturally lend themselves to comparison. For example, some English speakers would argue that it does not make sense to say that one thing is \"more ultimate\" than another, or that something is \"most ultimate\", since the word \"ultimate\" is already absolute in its semantics. Such adjectives are called non-comparable or absolute. Nevertheless, native speakers will frequently play with the raised forms of adjectives of this sort. Although \"pregnant\" is logically non-comparable (either one is pregnant or not), one may hear a sentence like \"She looks more and more pregnant each day\". Likewise \"extinct\" and \"equal\" appear to be non-comparable, but one might say that a language about which nothing is known is \"more extinct\" than a well-documented language with surviving literature but no speakers, while George Orwell wrote, \"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others\". These cases may be viewed as evidence that the base forms of these adjectives are not as absolute in their semantics as is usually thought.\nComparative and superlative forms are also occasionally used for other purposes than comparison. In English comparatives can be used to suggest that a statement is only tentative or tendential: one might say \"John is more the shy-and-retiring type,\" where the comparative \"more\" is not really comparing him with other people or with other impressions of him, but rather, could be substituting for \"on the whole\" or \"more so than not\". In Italian, superlatives are frequently used to put strong emphasis on an adjective: bellissimo means \"most beautiful\", but is in fact more commonly heard in the sense \"extremely beautiful\".\n\n\n== Restrictiveness ==\n\nAttributive adjectives and other noun modifiers may be used either restrictively (helping to identify the noun's referent, hence \"restricting\" its reference) or non-restrictively (helping to describe a noun). For example:\n\nHe was a lazy sort, who would avoid a difficult task and fill his working hours with easy ones.\n\"difficult\" is restrictive \u2013 it tells us which tasks he avoids, distinguishing these from the easy ones: \"Only those tasks that are difficult\".\nShe had the job of sorting out the mess left by her predecessor, and she performed this difficult task with great acumen.\n\"difficult\" is non-restrictive \u2013 we already know which task it was, but the adjective describes it more fully: \"The aforementioned task, which (by the way) is difficult\"In some languages, such as Spanish, restrictiveness is consistently marked; for example, in Spanish la tarea dif\u00edcil means \"the difficult task\" in the sense of \"the task that is difficult\" (restrictive), whereas la dif\u00edcil tarea means \"the difficult task\" in the sense of \"the task, which is difficult\" (non-restrictive). In English, restrictiveness is not marked on adjectives but is marked on relative clauses (the difference between \"the man who recognized me was there\" and \"the man, who recognized me, was there\" being one of restrictiveness).\n\n\n== Agreement ==\nIn some languages, adjectives alter their form to reflect the gender, case and number of the noun that they describe. This is called agreement or concord. Usually it takes the form of inflections at the end of the word, as in Latin:\n\nIn Celtic languages, however, initial consonant lenition marks the adjective with a feminine singular noun, as in Irish:\n\nOften, distinction is made here between attributive and predicative usage. In English, adjectives never agree, whereas in French, they always agree. In German, they agree only when they are used attributively, and in Hungarian, they agree only when they are used predicatively:\n\n\n== See also ==\nAttributive verb\nFlat adverb\nGrammatical modifier\nIntersective modifier\nList of eponymous adjectives in English\nNoun adjunct\nPostpositive adjective\nPredication (philosophy)\nPrivative adjective\nProper adjective\nSubsective modifier\n\n\n== Notes and references ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== References ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nDixon, R.M.W.

The power set of an infinite set is infinite. Any superset of an infinite set is infinite. If an infinite set is partitioned into finitely many subsets, then at least one of them must be infinite. Any set which can be mapped onto an infinite set is infinite. The Cartesian product of an infinite set and a nonempty set is infinite. The Cartesian product of an infinite number of sets, each containing at least two elements, is either empty or infinite; if the axiom of choice holds, then it is infinite.\nIf an infinite set is a well-ordered set, then it must have a nonempty, nontrivial subset that has no greatest element.\nIn ZF, a set is infinite if and only if the power set of its power set is a Dedekind-infinite set, having a proper subset equinumerous to itself.
