  "content": "Zbigniew Preisner (Polish: [\u02c8zbi\u0261\u0272\u025bf \u02c8prajsn\u025br]; born 20 May 1955 as Zbigniew Antoni Kowalski) is a Polish film score composer, best known for his work with film director Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski.\n\n\n== Life ==\nZbigniew Preisner was born in Bielsko-Bia\u0142a, southern Poland, and studied history and philosophy in Krak\u00f3w. Never having received formal music lessons, he taught himself music by listening and transcribing parts from records. His compositional style represents a distinctively sparse form of tonal neo-Romanticism. Paganini and Jean Sibelius are acknowledged influences.\n\n\n== Career ==\nPreisner is best known for the music composed for the films directed by fellow Pole Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski. His Song for the Unification of Europe, based on the Greek text of 1 Corinthians 13, is attributed to a character in Kie\u015blowski's Three Colors: Blue and plays a dominating role in the story. His music for Three Colors: Red includes a setting of Polish and French versions of a poem by Wis\u0142awa Szymborska, a Polish Nobel Prize-winning poet.After working with Kie\u015blowski on Three Colors: Blue, Preisner was hired by the producer Francis Ford Coppola to write the score for The Secret Garden, directed by Polish director Agnieszka Holland. Although Preisner is most closely associated with Kie\u015blowski, he has collaborated with several other directors, winning a C\u00e9sar in 1996 for his work on Jean Becker's \u00c9lisa. He has won a number of other awards, including another C\u00e9sar in 1994 for Three Colors: Red, and the Silver Bear from the 47th Berlin International Film Festival 1997 for The Island on Bird Street. He was nominated for Golden Globe awards for his scores for Three Colors: Blue (1993) and At Play in the Fields of the Lord (1991).\nIn 1998, Requiem for My Friend, Preisner's first large scale work not written for film, premiered. It was originally intended as a narrative work to be written by Krzysztof Piesiewicz and directed by Kie\u015blowski, but it became a memorial to Kie\u015blowski after the director's death. The Lacrimosa from this Requiem appears in Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life. The Dies Irae from this Requiem appears in the film La Grande Bellezza, directed by Paolo Sorrentino and in the second season of the television series The Crown.Preisner composed the theme music for the People's Century, a monumental 26-part documentary made jointly in 1994 by the BBC television network in United Kingdom and the PBS television network in the United States. He has also worked with director Thomas Vinterberg on the 2003 film It's All About Love. He provided orchestration for David Gilmour's 2006 album On An Island as well as additional orchestrations for the show at Gda\u0144sk shipyards at which he also conducted the Baltic Philharmonic Orchestra, this was documented on the album Live in Gda\u0144sk (2008). Silence, Night and Dreams is Zbigniew Preisner's new recording project, a large-scale work for orchestra, choir and soloists, based on texts from the Book of Job. The premier recording, was released in 2007 with the lead singer of Madredeus, Teresa Salgueiro and boy soprano Thomas Cully from Libera.\n\n\n== Van den Budenmayer ==\nVan den Budenmayer is a fictitious 18th-century Dutch composer created by Preisner and director Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski for attributions in screenplays. Preisner said Van den Budenmayer is a pseudonym he and Kie\u015blowski invented \"because we both loved the Netherlands\". Music \"by\" the Dutch composer plays a role in three Kie\u015blowski films. The first is Dekalog (1988). The second is Three Colours: Blue (1993) in which a theme from his musique funebres is quoted in the Song for the Unification of Europe. Its E minor soprano solo is prefigured in the earlier film The Double Life of Veronique (1991), where circumstances in the story prevent the solo from finishing. The third is Three Colours: Red (1994).\n\n\n== Works ==\n\n\n=== Orchestral works ===\nRequiem for my friend (1998)\nLife (1998)\nSilence, Night and Dreams (2007)\nOn an Island (2006) (a David Gilmour album for which Preisner composed orchestrations for many tracks)\nLive in Gda\u0144sk (September 22, 2008) (a David Gilmour live album)\nDiaries Of Hope (2013)\nRattle That Lock (2015) (another David Gilmour album for which Preisner provided orchestrations)\n\n\n=== Music for solo instruments ===\n10 Easy Pieces for Piano (2000)Performed by Leszek Mo\u017cd\u017cer\n10 Pieces for Orchestra (2015) Performed by The Symphonic Orchestra of the Calisia Philharmonic\n\n\n=== Theatre ===\nDas Begr\u00e4bnis (The Funeral) (2010) a play by Thomas Vinterberg and Mogens Rukov\n\n\n=== Film scores ===\nPrognoza pogody (1981)\nBez konca (1985)\nLubie nietoperze (1986)\nPrzez dotyk (1986)\nThe Lullabye (1987)\nUcieczka (1987)\nTo Kill a Priest (1988)\nA Short Film About Killing (1988)\nA Short Film About Love (1988)\nKocham kino (1988)\nDekalog (1988-9)\nOstatni dzwonek (1989)\nEuropa Europa (1990)\nEminent Domain (1991)\nThe Double Life of V\u00e9ronique (1991)\nAt Play in the Fields of the Lord (1991)\nZwolnieni z zycia (1992)\nOlivier, Olivier (1992)\nDamage (1992)\nThree Colors: Blue (1993)\nThe Secret Garden (1993)\nOn the Edge of the Horizon (1993)\nDesire in Motion (Mouvements du d\u00e9sir) (1994)\nKouarteto se 4 kiniseis (1994)\nThree Colors: White (1994)\nWhen a Man Loves a Woman (1994)\nThree Colors: Red (1994)\nFeast of July (1995)\n\u00c9lisa (1995)\nFoolish Heart (1996)\nFairyTale: A True Story (1997)\nThe Island on Bird Street (1997)\nThe Last September (1999)\nDreaming of Joseph Lees (1999)\nAberdeen (2000)\nWeiser (2001)\nBetween Strangers (2002)\nIt's All About Love (2003)\nStrange Gardens (2003)\nKolysanka (2003)\nSuperTex (2003)\nThe Beautiful Country (2004)\nSportsman of the Century (2006)\nAnonyma - Eine Frau in Berlin (2008)\nThe Tree of Life (2011) (1 track)\nAglaja (2012)\nLa grande bellezza (2013) (1 track)\nLost and Love (2015)\nLies We Tell (2017)\nValley of Shadows (2017)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nZbigniew Preisner official site\nRepresentative company of Zbigniew Preisner in Greece and Cyprus\nInterview with Preisner with director Edoardo Ponti.\nZbigniew Preisner discography at MusicBrainz\nZbigniew Preisner at IMDb\nTelevision Interview with Preisner from C Music TV.\nPreisner \u0130nfo from musicolog.com.",
