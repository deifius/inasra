"Malebolgia (also referred to at times as the Malebolgia ) is a fictional supervillain appearing as the original main antagonist in comic books featuring the superhero Spawn and later reprise the role in the later issues. Created by writer/artist Todd McFarlane, the character first appeared in Spawn #1 (May 1992). The name Malebolgia is derived from the term in Dante's Inferno used to describe Malebolge, the ditches (bolge) in the eighth circle of Hell, where humans who committed the sin Fraud are punished. He is Spawn's former master who serves as one of the major Lords of Hell."
