Created by writer/artist Todd McFarlane, the character first appeared in Spawn #1 (May 1992). The name Malebolgia is derived from the term in Dante's Inferno used to describe Malebolge, the ditches (bolge) in the eighth circle of Hell, where humans who committed the sin Fraud are punished. He is Spawn's former master who serves as one of the major Lords of Hell.\n\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\nThought to be the equivalent of Satan in the Bible, he is responsible for the creation of Spawn. It is eventually revealed that Malebolgia is one of Hell's many rulers, a being from the \"Eighth Circle of Hell\" who has been around for approximately 70,000 years, forming an army in his war against Heaven and God. It has been noted that Malebolgia is constantly at war with the rulers of the other spheres of Hell, as well as at odds with Mammon.\nMalebolgia was the creation of the previous ruler of the Eighth Sphere of Hell named Leviathan. Whom he created from a substance also of his creation called Necroplasm. Eventually Malebolgia killed his master and took over as ruler of the Eighth Sphere.\nMalebolgia is one of the few characters from the Spawn universe who has made an appearance or a cameo in other Image books outside the core Spawn title and its spin-offs. He is notably absent, but as mentioned, during Chapel's rise to power in Hell when he usurps control of Hell away from Lucifer and becomes Lord Chapel as part of a large Image crossover including Prophet, Supreme, and the groups Youngblood and Brigade. Lucifer also appears in the Angela mini-series, quite different from the Lucifer in the Liefeld-laden crossover. That leaves Malebolgia and Mammon as the highest-ranking devil-like characters in Spawn canon until the actual appearance of Satan in the Spawn Comics.\n\n\n=== Death ===\nMalebolgia is slain by Spawn in issue #100. Spawn is offered the crown of the Eighth Circle, and though he declines, Spawn still receives vastly enhanced powers and command over Hell itself. It has become known that Mammon is a far more commanding presence in Hell than Malebolgia and later on Satan himself being the true ruler of Hell. Though Malebolgia is given self-determination and rule over a level of Hell, he is far from the most powerful being in The Pit.\n\n\n=== Return ===\nAs Spawn issue #199 ends, the now-returned \"Freak\" from early Spawn canon is attacked by Clown, who rips the Freak's arms off.  The Freak laughs it off and lets Clown know that he is not scared of him or any other of the Spawns because they are all \"his.\"  Clown quickly shies away as the Freak begins to transform. After reattaching his arm, the Freak transports Violator to Hell. Upon returning to Hell, Violator regains his full strength, as well as his senses. The Freak reveals his true identity to be Malebolgia. After being defeated by Al Simmons, the Lords of Hell cut off Malebolgia's power and set up \"roadblocks\" to ensure that he never returned. Betrayed, Malebolgia swears to regain his true power and form and kill all those who tried to prevent his return, including the Violator who had sided with Malebolgia's greatest rival, Mammon, after Malebolgia's fall. Malebolgia orders Violator to spread the word of his return in order to spread fear. Malebolgia would be later defeated by Leetha, who took over Downing, destroying the Freak's body, seemingly killing him. Presumably, Malebolgia is still around trying to reform himself in some other way.\n\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\nMalebolgia is respected and feared as one of the rulers of Hell, and thus the de facto grandmaster of Hell. His powers include Necro Energies like raising the dead, matter manipulation, super strength, recuperative abilities, and abilities to morph and induce hallucinations. His standing in Hell's hierarchy gives him vast power while in the 8th Sphere. His mastery of necroplasm gives him the exclusive ability to create Hellspawn and during his rule, he creates an army larger and more powerful than anything Heaven or he himself could handle.\n\n\n== In other media ==\nMalebolgia appears in the 1997 film adaptation of Spawn, voiced by Frank Welker.\nDespite his major role and frequent appearances in the comic during its early run, Malebolgia ironically does not appear in the Spawn television series; his name, however, is mentioned frequently throughout the show, and his presence and influence is greatly apparent, with frequent allusions and mentions of him; notably, in the episode 4, a brief glimpse of Malebolgia's face and his lair was seen.\nMalebolgia appears in Spawn: In the Demon's Hand, voiced by Tony Daniels.\nMalebolgia appears in Spawn: Armageddon, voiced by David Sobolov.\nAppears in the Robot Chicken episode \"Celebutard Mountain\", voiced by Tom Root. He and Spawn compete in a fiddle contest reminiscent of \"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\" by the Charlie Daniels Band.\nHe appears in Soulcalibur II for the Xbox, sending Spawn after Soul Edge. Spawn also mentions Malebolgia in a victory pose by saying, \"Malebolgia, just you wait!\"\nHe is the main subject in the song \"The Last Laugh\" from Iced Earth's The Dark Saga, a concept album based on Spawn.\nMalebolgia is the name of a death metal band from Greensboro, North Carolina.\nMalebolgia is the name of the newest state in the US in the Big Finish production \"Minuet in Hell\".\nMalebolgia appears in Mortal Kombat 11 as part of one of Spawn's victory poses and as a cameo in Spawn's arcade ending. In the game, he is apparently revealed to be Shinnok's & Cetrion's cousin.\n\n\n== References ==", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bc/Malebolgia.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg"], "summary": "Malebolgia (also referred to at times as the Malebolgia ) is a fictional supervillain appearing as the original main antagonist in comic books featuring the superhero Spawn and later reprise the role in the later issues.

The tenant thenceforth owed to the overlord one of a variety of services, usually military service or serjeanty, depending on which form of tenure (i.e. feudal tenancy contract) the estate was held under. The highest overlord of all, or paramount lord,  was the monarch, who due to his ancestor William the Conqueror's personal conquest of the Kingdom of England, owned by inheritance from him all the land in England under allodial title and had no superior overlord, \"holding from God and his sword\", although certain monarchs, notably King John (1199\u20131216) purported to grant the Kingdom of England to Pope Innocent III, who would thus have become overlord to English monarchs.\nA paramount lord may then be seen to occupy the apex of the feudal pyramid, or the root of the feudal tree, and such allodial title is also termed \"radical title\" (from Latin radix, root), \"ultimate title\" and \"final title\". William the Conqueror immediately set about granting tenancies on his newly won lands, in accordance with feudal principles. The monarch's immediate tenants were the tenants-in-chief, usually military magnates, who held the highest status in feudal society below the monarch. The tenants-in-chief usually held multiple manors or other estates from the monarch, often as feudal barons (or \"barons by tenure\") who owed their royal overlord an enhanced and onerous form of military service, and subinfeudated most to tenants, generally their own knights or military followers, keeping only a few in demesne. This created a mesne lord \u2013 tenant relationship. The knights in turn subinfeudated to their own tenants, creating a further subsidiary mesne lord \u2013 tenant relationship. Over the centuries for any single estate the process was in practice repeated numerous times.\nIn early times, following the Norman Conquest of England of 1066 and the establishment of feudalism, land was usually transferred by subinfeudation, rarely by alienation (i.e. sale), which latter in the case of tenants-in-chief required royal licence, and the holder of an estate at any particular time, in order to gain secure tenure, and if challenged by another claimant, needed to prove \"devolution of title\" evidenced by legal deeds or muniments back up the chain of subinfeudations to a holder whose title was beyond doubt, for example one who had received the estate as a grant by royal charter witnessed and sealed by substantial persons. Although feudal land tenure in England was abolished by the Tenures Abolition Act 1660, in modern English conveyancing law the need to prove devolution of title persisted until recent times, due to a \"legal fiction\" (grounded in reality) that all land titles were held by the monarch's subjects as a result of a royal grant. Proving devolution of title is no longer necessary since the creation of the land registry. There is a requirement to compulsorily register all land transactions on this governmental record, which registration provides a virtually unchallengeable and perfectly secure title of ownership.\n\n\n== Process of creation ==\nAn overlordship came into existence by the process of the lord of the manor granting seizin of the fee concerned to his prospective tenant and receiving from him homage and fealty, the main elements of the infeudation and subinfeudation process.\n\n\n== Rights ==\nAn overlord had various rights under the feudal system, including receipt of either feudal relief or heriot on the succession of the tenant's heir. Also the right of escheat, namely to receive back seizin of the estate on the death of the tenant without a legal heir (transfers of estates to third parties by testaments or wills were not part of the early feudal system). The right to the loyalty of his tenant was central to the feudal contract and was enshrined in the infeudation process in which the tenant swore loyalty to the overlord. In the event of disloyalty the feudal contract would be broken and the estate would become forfeit and return to the overlord. This is most commonly encountered in the case of treason where lands became forfeit to the monarch as paramount lord.\n\n\n== Obligations ==\nThe overlord was bound to protect his tenant, a valuable right for the latter in the days before the existence of police forces and universal access to royal justice, and when armed bands of robbers roamed the countryside. This protection extended also to sheltering his tenant from the arbitrary and predatory acts of other powerful local magnates.\n\n\n== Modern vestiges ==\nIn the language of English law of landlord and tenant the concept of the feudal overlord persists. Furthermore, in England today in the case of a land-owner dying intestate and without legal heirs, just as in the feudal age, his estate effectively escheats and reverts to the overlord, but in the form of the paramount lord, The Crown, and is disposed of by the Crown Estate. In Cornwall today land is still in theory held from the Duke of Cornwall as lord paramount. In the case of English land escheating situated within the Duchy of Lancaster or the Duchy of Cornwall, it reverts to the overlords the Duke of Lancaster (the monarch) and the Duke of Cornwall (the monarch's eldest son), possibly the only two surviving quasi-paramount feudal lords surviving in England other than the monarch.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBrennan On The Doctrine Of Tenures, the legacy of feudal overlordship in Australia [3]\n\n\n== References ==", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/Bayeux_Tapestry_scene23_Harold_sacramentum_fecit_Willelmo_duci.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/61/Reeve_and_Serfs.jpg"], "summary": "An overlord in the English feudal system was a lord of a manor who had subinfeudated a particular manor,  estate or fee, to a tenant.

This distinguished it from land sub-enfeoffed by him to others as sub-tenants.\nIn England, Wales and Northern Ireland, royal demesne is the land held by the Crown, and ancient demesne is the legal term for the land held by the king at the time of the Domesday Book.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word derives from Old French demeine, ultimately from Latin dominus, \"lord, master of a household\" \u2013 demesne is a variant of domaine.The word barton, which is an element found in many place-names, can refer to a demesne farm: it derives from Old English bere (barley) and ton (enclosure).\n\n\n== Development ==\nThe system of manorial land tenure, broadly termed feudalism, was conceived in France, but was exported to areas affected by Norman expansion during the Middle Ages, including the Kingdoms of England, Sicily, Jerusalem, Scotland, and Ireland.\nIn this feudal system, the demesne was all the land retained and managed by a lord of the manor for his own use and support. It was not necessarily all contiguous to the manor house. A portion of the demesne lands, called the lord's waste, served as public roads and common pasture land for the lord and his tenants. Most of the remainder of the land in the manor was sub-enfeoffed by the lord to others as sub-tenants.\nInitially, the demesne lands were worked on the lord's behalf by villeins or by serfs, who had no right of tenure on it, in fulfilment of their feudal obligations, but as a money economy developed in the later Middle Ages, the serfs' corv\u00e9e came to be commuted to money payments. With the advent of the early modern period, demesne lands came to be cultivated by paid labourers. Eventually, many of the demesne lands were leased out either on a perpetual (i.e., hereditary) or a temporary renewable basis so that many peasants functioned virtually as free proprietors after having paid their fixed rents. In times of inflation or debasement of coinage, the rent might come to represent a pittance, reducing the feudal aristocrat to poverty among a prosperous gentry.Demesne lands that were leased out for a term of years remained demesne lands, though no longer in the occupation of the lord of the manor. See, for example, Musgrave v Inclosure Commissioners (1874) LR 9 QB 162, a case in which the three judges of the Queen's Bench Divisional Court and everyone else concerned assumed without argument that farms which were let by the lord of the manor were part of the lord's demesne land.\nIn Ireland, demesne lands were often demarcated with high stone walls. Today, 24 townlands in Ireland bear the name of \"Demesne\", and many others contain the word.\n\n\n== Royal demesne ==\nImmediately following the Norman Conquest of 1066, all land in England was claimed by King William the Conqueror as his absolute title by allodial right, being the commencement of the royal demesne, also known as Crown land. The king made grants of very large tracts of land under various forms of feudal tenure from his demesne, generally in the form of feudal baronies. The land not so enfeoffed, for example royal manors administered by royal stewards and royal hunting forests, thus remained within the royal demesne. In the Domesday Book of 1086, this land is referred to as terra regis (literally \"the king's land\"), and in English common law the term ancient demesne refers to the land that was held by the Crown at the time of the Domesday Book.The royal demesne was not a static portfolio: it could be increased, for example, as a result of escheat or forfeiture where a feudal tenure would end and revert to its natural state in the royal demesne, or it could be reduced by later grants of land. During the reign of King George III (1760\u20131820), Parliament appropriated most of the royal demesne, in exchange for a fixed annual sum thenceforth payable to the monarch, called the Civil List. The position of the royal estate of Windsor, still occupied by the monarch and never alienated since 1066, may be a rare remnant of the royal demesne.In the Lordship of Ireland, King Henry II claimed a large area as the royal demesne in 1171: Dublin, its hinterland, the coastline down to Arklow and the towns of Wexford and Waterford. This region around Dublin would evolve into The Pale.\n\n\n== Derivative usage ==\nSince the demesne surrounded the principal seat of the lord, it came to be loosely used of any proprietary territory: \"the works of Shakespeare are this scholar's demesne.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nTownland\nMains (Scotland)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nCor\u00e8don, Christopher; Williams, Ann (2004).

The sense is of a feudal estate in land falling-out of the possession by a tenant into the possession of the lord.\n\n\n== Origins in feudalism ==\nIn feudal England, escheat  referred to the situation where the tenant of a fee (or \"fief\") died without an heir or committed a felony. In the case of such demise of a tenant-in-chief, the fee reverted to the King's demesne permanently, when it became once again a mere tenantless plot of land,  but could be re-created as a fee by enfeoffment to another of the king's followers. Where the deceased had been subinfeudated by a tenant-in-chief, the fee reverted temporarily to the crown  for one year and one day by right of primer seisin after which it escheated to the  over-lord who had granted it to the deceased by enfeoffment. From the time of Henry III, the monarchy took particular interest in escheat as a source of revenue.\n\n\n=== Background ===\nAt the Norman conquest of England, all the land of England was claimed as the personal possession of William the Conqueror under allodial title. The monarch thus became the sole \"owner\" of all the land in the kingdom, a position which persists to the present day. He then granted it out to his favoured followers, who thereby became tenants-in-chief, under various contracts of feudal land tenure. Such tenures, even the highest one of \"feudal barony\", never conferred ownership of land but merely ownership of rights over it, that is to say ownership of an estate in land. Such persons are therefore correctly termed \"land-holders\" or \"tenants\" (from Latin teneo to hold), not owners. If held freely, that is to say by freehold, such holdings were heritable by the holder's legal heir. On the payment  of a premium termed feudal relief to the treasury, such heir was entitled to demand re-enfeoffment by the king with the fee concerned.\nWhere no legal heir existed, the logic of the situation was  that the fief had ceased to exist as a legal entity, since being tenantless no one was living who had been enfeoffed with the land, and the land was thus technically owned by either the crown or the immediate overlord (where the fee had been subinfeudated by the tenant-in-chief to a mesne lord, and perhaps the process of subinfeudation had been continued by a lower series of mesne-lords) as ultimus haeres. Logically therefore it was in the occupation of the crown alone, that is to say in the royal demesne. This was the basic operation of an escheat (excadere), a failure of heirs.\nEscheat could also take place if a tenant was outlawed or convicted of a felony, when the King could exercise the ancient right of wasting the criminal's land for a year and a day, after which the land would revert to the overlord. (However, one guilty of treason (rather than mere felony) forfeited all lands to the King. John and his heirs frequently insisted on seizing as terrae Normannorum (i.e. \"lands of the Normans\") the English lands of those lords with holdings in Normandy who preferred to be Normans rather than Englishmen, when the victories of Philip II of France forced them to make a proclamation of allegiance to France.)  Since disavowal of a feudal bond was a felony, lords could escheat land from those who refused to perform their feudal services.  On the other hand, there were also tenants who were merely sluggish in performing their duties, while not being outright rebellious against the lord.  Remedies in the courts against this sort of thing, even in Bracton's day, were available, but were considered laborious and were frequently ineffectual in compelling the desired performance.  The commonest mechanism was distraint, also known as distress (districtio), whereby the lord would seize chattels or goods belonging to the tenant, to hold until performance was achieved.  This practice had been addressed in the 1267 Statute of Marlborough.  Even so, it remained the most common extrajudicial method applied by overlords at the time of Quia Emptores.Thus, under English common law, there were two main ways an escheat could happen:\n\nA person's lands escheated to the immediate overlord if he was convicted of a felony (but not treason, in that event the land was forfeited to the Crown).  If the person was executed for felony, his heirs were attainted, i.e. were ineligible to inherit. In most common-law jurisdictions, this type of escheat has been abolished outright, for example in the United States under Article 3 \u00a7 3 of the United States Constitution, which states that attainders for treason do not give rise to posthumous forfeiture, or \"corruption of blood\".\nIf a person had no heir to receive his lands under his Will, or under the laws of intestacy, then any land he owned at death would escheat. This rule has been replaced in most common-law jurisdictions by bona vacantia or a similar concept.\n\n\n== Procedure ==\nFrom the 12th century onward, the Crown appointed escheators to manage escheats and report to the Exchequer, with one escheator per county established by the middle of the 14th century. Upon  the death of a tenant-in-chief, the escheator would be instructed by a writ of diem clausit extremum (\"he has closed his last day\", i.e. he is dead) issued by the king's chancery, to empanel a jury to hold an \"inquisition post mortem\" to ascertain who the legal heir was, if any, and what was the extent of the land held. Thus it would be revealed whether the king had any rights to the land. It was also important for the king to know who the heir was, and to assess his personal qualities, since he would thenceforth form a constituent part of the royal army, if he held under military tenure. If there was any doubt, the escheator would seize the land and refer the case to the king's  court where it would be settled, ensuring that not one day's revenue would be lost. This would be a source of concern with land-holders when there were delays from the court.\n\n\n== Current operation ==\n\nMost common-law jurisdictions have abolished the concept of feudal land tenure of property, and so the concept of escheat has lost something of its meaning. In England and Wales, the possibility of escheat of a deceased person's property to the feudal overlord was abolished by the Administration of Estates Act 1925; however, the concept of Bona vacantia means that the crown (or Duchy of Cornwall or Duchy of Lancaster) can still receive such property if no one else can be found who is eligible to inherit it.\nThe term is often now applied to the transfer of the title to a person's property to the state when the person dies intestate without any other person capable of taking the property as heir. For example, a common-law jurisdiction's intestacy statute might provide that when someone dies without a will, and is not survived by a spouse, descendants, parents, grandparents, descendants of parents, children or grandchildren of grandparents, or great-grandchildren of grandparents, then the person's estate will escheat to the state.\nIn some jurisdictions, escheat can also occur when an entity, typically a bank, credit union or other financial institution, holds money or property which appears to be  unclaimed, for instance due to a lack of activity on the account by way of deposits, withdrawals or any other transactions for a lengthy time in a cash account.  In many jurisdictions, if the owner cannot be located, such property can be revocably escheated to the state.\nIn commerce, it is the process of reassigning legal title in unclaimed or abandoned payroll checks, insurance payouts, or stocks and shares whose owners cannot be traced, to a state authority (in the United States). A company is required to file unclaimed property reports with its state annually and, in some jurisdictions, to make a good-faith effort to find the owners of their dormant accounts.  The escheating criteria are set by individual state regulations.\n\n\n=== England and Wales ===\n\n\n==== Bankruptcies and liquidations ====\nEscheat can still occur in England and Wales, if a person is made bankrupt or a corporation is liquidated. Usually this means that all the property held by that person is 'vested in' (transferred to) the Official Receiver or Trustee in Bankruptcy. However, it is open to the Receiver or Trustee to refuse to accept that property by disclaiming it. It is relatively common for a trustee in bankruptcy to disclaim freehold property which may give rise to a liability, for example the common parts of a block of flats owned by the bankrupt would ordinarily pass to the trustee to be realised in order to pay his debts, but the property may give the landlord an obligation to spend money for the benefit of lessees of the flats. The bankruptcy of the original owner means that the freehold is no longer the bankrupt's legal property, and the disclaimer destroys the freehold estate, so that the land ceases to be owned by anyone and effectively escheats to become land held by the Crown in demesne.  This situation affects a few hundred properties each year.\nAlthough such escheated property is owned by the Crown, it is not part of the Crown Estate, unless the Crown (through the Crown Estate Commissioners) 'completes' the escheat, by taking steps to exert rights as owner. However, usually, in the example given above, the tenants of the flats, or their mortgagees would exercise their rights given by the Insolvency Act 1986 to have the freehold property transferred to them. This is the main difference between escheat and bona vacantia, as in the latter, a grant takes place automatically, with no need to 'complete' the transaction.\n\n\n==== Registration of Crown land ====\nOne consequence of the Land Registration Act 1925 was that only estates in land (freehold or leasehold) could be registered. Land held directly by the Crown, known as property in the \"royal demesne\", is not held under any vestigial feudal tenure (the crown has no historical overlord other than, for brief periods, the papacy) and there is therefore no estate to register. This  had the consequence that freeholds which escheated to the Crown ceased to be registrable. This created a slow drain of property out of registration, amounting to some hundreds of freehold titles in each year.\nThe problem was noted by the Law Commission in their report \"Land Registration for the Twenty-First Century\". The Land Registration Act 2002 was passed in response to that report. It provides that land held in demesne by the Crown may be registered.\n\n\n=== United States ===\n\n\n==== Transfer agents and escheatment ====\nEscheatment is the process of returning lost or unclaimed property to the government of a State, for safekeeping until the owner(s) is identified. Geographic jurisdiction of the State is determined by the last known address of the original owner. Each of the United States has laws regulating escheatment, with holding periods typically ranging around five years. The legal principle behind escheatment is that all property has a legally recognized owner; therefore, if the original owner cannot be found within a specified time, government is presumed to be the owner.Escheats are performed on a revocable basis. Thus, if property has escheated to a State but the original owner subsequently is found, escheatment is revoked and ownership of the property reverts to that original owner.\n\n\n==== Lost shareholders ====\nAccording to SEC Rule 17 CFR 240.17f-1: Transfer Agents are obligated by the SEC to report to Commission (specifically to its designee; the SEC's Securities Information System) anytime a certificate is known to be lost or missing for at least 2 days. Transfer Agents must search for the holder's SSN or EIN utilizing an information database system, or if not available, exercise their best effort to match the holder's name and address through these systems. All Transfer Agents must report all lost or missing certificates/shareholders on their own annual filings.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBona vacantia\nBreakage\nDoctrine of lapse\nHistory of the English fiscal system\nIntestacy\nQuia Emptores\n\n\n== Sources ==\nS.T.
