Intention involves mental activities such as planning and forethought.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nFolk psychology explains human behavior on the basis of mental states, including beliefs, desires, and intentions. Mental mechanisms, including intention, explain behavior in that individuals are seen as actors who have desires and who attempt to achieve goals that are directed by beliefs. Thus, an intentional action is a function to accomplish a desired goal and is based on the belief that the course of action will satisfy a desire.There is also a theoretical distinction between intentionality (intentional actions), and a mental state of intention for the future. Searle (1983) labeled these as intention-in-action and prior intention respectively. Prior intentions reflect forethought about intentions-in-action; prior intentions do not need to be carried out to be considered intentions. An unfulfilled intention is a prior intention that has no action associated with it.Astington (1993) outlined the connections between mental states (desires, beliefs, and intentions) and actions carried out by an individual in order to reach a goal; these connections are referred to as the Intentional Chain.  The proposed connective chain is that desire causes intention, which causes action, which causes outcome.  The Intentional Chain maps the linking of a desire to the satisfaction of a goal via the intermediary intention.\n\n\n== The development of an understanding of intention ==\nUnderstanding intention is thought to be pivotal in understanding social contexts in numerous ways. First, acquiring an understanding of intention is important for development in that it helps children conceptualize how people and animals differ from objects. Much of behavior is caused by intentions, and understanding intentions helps to interpret these behaviors. Second, intentions are integral to an understanding of morality. Children learn to assign praise or blame based on whether actions of others are intentional. Intention is also necessary to understand and predict the plans and future actions of others. Understanding the intentions and motives of others aids in the interpretation of communication, and the achievement of cooperative goals.Psychological research suggests that understanding intentions of others may be a prerequisite for a higher-level understanding of other people's minds or theory of mind. Theory of mind research attempts to map how children come to understand the mind as a representational device for the world. This research has focused on the development of knowledge that others have beliefs, desires, and intentions that are different from one's own.  A basic ability to comprehend other people's intentions based on their actions is critical to the development of theory of mind. Social, cognitive and developmental psychological research has focused on the question: How do young children develop the ability to understand other people's behaviors and intentions?\n\n\n=== Intentional acts in infancy and childhood ===\nFrom an early age, typically-developing children parse human actions in terms of goals, rather than in terms of movements in space, or muscle movements.  Meltzoff (1995) conducted a study in which 18-month-olds were shown an unsuccessful act. For instance, children watched an adult accidentally under or over shoot a target, or attempt to perform an action but their hand slipped. The aim of the study was to determine whether the children were able to interpret the intention of the adult, regardless of the actual action performed.  Young children have a tendency to imitate other people's actions. The outcome measure was what the child chose to re-enact\u2014the actual event (literal motions), or the adult's goal, which was not accomplished.  The results of the study suggested that 18-month-olds are able to infer unseen goals and intentions of others based on their actions. Infants who saw unsuccessful attempts at a target act and infants who saw the target act imitated the act at a higher rate than infants who saw neither the act nor an attempt.  Similar paradigms were conducted with children 9 months old and 15 months old.  Nine-month-olds did not respond to the unsuccessful attempt demonstrations; however, 15-month-olds acted similarly to the 18-month-olds. This suggests that between 9 months and 15 months of age the ability to infer intentions in other people develops.The development of understanding intention has also been studied in toddlers. As mentioned previously, an intentional action is based on the belief that the course of action will satisfy a desire. In that case, what was intended can be interpreted as a function of an understanding for what was desired. When outcomes are achieved without the action of the individual directed at the goal, intention is not attributed to the actor; rather, the event is considered an accident.  Research by Astington and colleagues (1993) found that 3-year-olds are skilled at matching goals to outcomes to infer intention. If another individual's goals match an outcome, 3-year-olds are able to conclude that the action was done \u201con purpose.\u201d Conversely, when goals do not match outcomes, the children labeled the individual's actions as accidental. Children may come to distinguish between desire and intention when they learn to view the mind as a medium for representations of the world. Astington argues that initially desire is undifferentiated from intention in that both function as a goal state. Children then develop a more mature command of understanding other's intentions when they are able to represent an action as caused by a prior intention that is separate from desire.Thus, research suggests that by the age of fifteen months, humans are capable of understanding intentional acts in others. The ability to distinguish between intention and desire develops in early childhood. Gestures and object-directed actions have also been studied in connexion with the development of the understanding of intention. The development of the ability to use gestures and object-directed actions in social situations has been studied from numerous perspectives, including the embodiment perspective and the social-cognitive perspective.\n\n\n=== Gestures and object-directed intentions ===\nGestures are often recognized as a tool indicative of higher social reasoning. In order to engage in or understand a gesture, an individual has to recognize it as an indicator of an object or event separate from the self or the actor. It is thought that pointing, especially declarative pointing (i.e. pointing intended to direct and share intention rather than request an object), reveals the understanding of others as attentional and intentional agents (e.g. Liszkowski, Carpenter, & Tomasello, 2007). This understanding is indicated by object-directed reactions to pointing (rather than focusing on the hand). Pointing is also thought to denote perspective-taking ability and understanding of intention, as the individual must be able to understand that the actor is attending to the object and, perhaps most importantly, that the actor is attempting to communicate information regarding the referent. The development of pointing is thought to reach a critical stage at around 9 to 12 months in normally developing children (e.g. Leung & Rheingold, 1981; Moll & Tomasello, 2007; Schaffer, 2005). Liszkowski and colleagues (2004) found that human children begin to point at around one year of age and do so with a multiple motives, including sharing attention and interest. Earlier pointing may be different in nature and is thought to develop from a learned association between reaching and adult responsiveness to the child's desire for a referent object.Thus, it seems pointing may be more complex than a straightforward indicator of social understanding. Early pointing may not indicate an understanding of intention; rather it may indicate an association between the gesture and interesting objects or events. However, an understanding of intention may develop as the child develops a theory of mind and begins to use pointing to convey meaning about referents in the world.\n\n\n=== Embodiment perspective ===\nThe embodiment hypothesis holds that cognition arises out of an individual's physical interactions with the environment.  In this way, environment and behavior are an integral part of cognition and what psychologists conceive of as \u2018mental representations\u2019 are indistinguishable from perception and action (e.g. Smith, 2005). The ontogenetic development of social cognition may be thought of as intertwined with the development pointing actions. According to this perspective, gestures are not just indicators of development but play a key role in how children come to develop advanced social cognition, including understanding of object-directed relations and human intention. In particular, engaging in physical actions oneself may provide insight into the structure of another's actions (eventually leading to a more nuanced understanding of another's mind).One method of determining developmental relations between actions and an understanding of social nuances behind actions is to assess correlations between infants\u2019 reactions to actions and the frequency with which infants produce actions. Children are generally able to produce actions around the same time they are considered to be capable of understanding the actions in others.  For instance, Woodward and Guajardo (2002) found a correlation between children's ability to produce points (either during the experience or based on parental report of pointing at home) and their understanding of object-directed pointing (as evidenced by a preference for looking at a new object rather than a new hand path in a habituation paradigm) by 12 months. In addition, Brune and Woodward (2007) found that infants who produce object-directed points tended to have an understanding of pointing and infants who engaged in shared attention tended to have an understanding of eye gaze.  Although the findings are correlational, they support the idea that actions may facilitate cognitive understanding. It is unclear whether self-produced pointing gestures causally influence an understanding of pointing as relational; however, there is experimental evidence which suggests that infants supported in a new action skill will subsequently develop an understanding of that action. For instance, infants allowed to grasp objects with Velcro mittens gained an understanding of object-directed grasping.\n\n\n=== Social-cultural perspective ===\nA social-cultural perspective includes the notion that not just actions, but partaking in social interactions and cooperation (both observing and acting) are key to both ontogenetic social development and responsible for larger cultural institutions, symbol systems, and other human social abilities (e.g. Moll & Tomasello, 2007; Tomasello et al., 2005).\nThis social-cultural perspective is derived from the Vygotskian view that higher cognitive functions originate in relations between individuals. The strict version of this view is that these functions are social actions that have been internalized. Pointing, according to Vygotsky, starts out as an attempt to grab a desired object. Then, a transitional gesture develops in which the individual reaches toward the object when it is desired as a cue to another to retrieve it. This transitional gesture, says Vygotsky, is an important step toward language in that participation in these social interactions are internalized and become an understanding of the psychological functions of others. Thus, pointing is an example of the internalization process that occurs over a long series of developmental events. These gestures help children to gain an understanding of triadic interactions, as the gestures go from being simply about the objects to being specifically directed at people and conveying intention toward others.Tomasello and colleagues proposed a social-cultural perspective for understanding human affinity for advanced social cognition (e.g. Moll & Tomasello, 2007; Tomasello et al., 2005). This view takes from Vygotsky's theory the idea that social interactions (such as pointing) are not just indicative of higher cognitive functions, such as understanding intention, but play an important role in shaping them. They argue that advanced cognitive abilities are derived from the tendency to cooperate and engage in collaborative activities (e.g. Moll & Tomasello, 2007; Tomasello et al., 2005).\nIt was originally suspected that such foundational cognitive skills leading to advanced social understanding lie in the human ability to understand another's intention. Humans seem to have an affinity for figuring out what others are perceiving, intending, desiring, believing, etc. For example, the use of symbols requires the ability to understand another's action and attention on an entity in the world. However, understanding intentions is unlikely to be a species-specific ability.Tomasello and colleagues argue that it is possible to break down the advanced understanding of shared intentionality into two developmental pathways that eventually become intertwined:\n\nThe ability to understand others as goal-directed and intentional agents and\nA species-unique tendency to share emotions, events, and activities. Other species, such as great apes, understand the basics of intentionality; however, they do not exhibit behavior that suggests a willingness to engage in shared attention.This claim may be further investigated by examining the functional origins of pointing.  It is possible that the pointing exhibited by other species is different in purpose and origin from the pointing said to be indicative of a developing psychological understanding. The former, referred to as imperative pointing, was originally described by Vygotsky (1978) as pointing which begins in an attempt to reach for a desired object. When another retrieves the desired object, the individual learns to associate the gesture (typically hand and all fingers extended outward) with a communicated intention to acquire the desired object. However, research suggests not all points develop in this way. A study by Bates, Camaioni and Volterra (1975) distinguished between imperative and declarative gestures. Imperative gestures were described as those directed at an adult in order to obtain an object, while declarative gestures were those simply intended to obtain adult attention. Both types of gestures are social in nature; however, declarative pointing is thought to be linked to more advanced social understanding. Declarative gestures may involve more complex social and cooperative skills, linked to the development of communication skills (e.g. Liszkowski et al., 2005). For instance, Camaioni and colleagues found that declarative pointing was related to an understanding of adult's intentions, while imperative gestures were not related.According to a social-cultural perspective, it is not the actions of pointing themselves, but the tendency to engage in cooperative actions (as indicated by elements such as shared intentionality and declarative pointing) that determines the advanced social-cognitive status of normally developing humans. These cooperative actions reveal an understanding of intention and may be for the sole purpose of interacting or cooperating rather than achieving an end. It may be that declarative pointing (typically exhibited by normally developing children but not children with autism), rather than imperative pointing, is indicative of the tendency to engage in the cooperative interactions believed to be important for developing advanced social-cognitive understanding. This fits in with Tomasello and colleagues\u2019 conception that triadic social interactions in which child and adult engage in cooperative actions with shared intention are not only indicative of advanced social-cognitive ability but critical to the development of it. During these interactions, children gradually begin to conceptualize both first- and third-person perspectives, gaining a \u201cbird\u2019s eye view\u201d of social interactions.  Both the embodiment and social cultural perspectives share the principle that gestures are not just indicators of development, but play an important role in how children come to understand object-directed relations and human intention.\n\n\n== Gaze and attentional acts ==\nResearch suggests that faces are pivotal in offering social cues necessary for children's cognitive, language, and social development. These cues may offer information on another's emotional state, focus of attention, and potential intentions (For a discussion see Mosconi, Mack, McCarthy, & Pelphrey, 2005).\nIntention may be ascribed to an individual based on where in space that individual is attending. Intention is understood not only through actions and the manipulation of objects, but by tracking eye movements. Research in this area is focused on how humans develop the understanding that eye gaze indicates that the observer may be psychologically connected to the referent.Even as infants, humans are able to follow the gaze of others. Further research has aimed to test whether infants are simply inclined to look in the direction of head movements, without any real understanding of another individual's psychological state.  Brooks (1999) found that children do not direct attention simply toward the visual hemisphere of novel head movements; rather, children as young as 15 months attend to object-directed eye gaze, suggesting that children are attending to referents to which others attend, and are not simply gazing in a similar direction. These results support the idea that infants understand eye gaze as an indicator of another individual's psychological state, which is a basic component of understanding that others may have intentions separate from one's own.\n\n\n== Biological motion and inferring intention ==\nNeuroimaging research suggests that biological motion is processed differently from other types of motion. Biological motion is processed as a category in which individuals are able to infer intention.  An evolutionary perspective of this phenomenon is that humans survived on the basis of being able to predict the internal mental states and potential future actions of others. Research on biological motion has found cells in the primate superior temporal polysensory area (STP) that respond specifically to biological motion. In addition, there are brain regions, including the superior temporal sulcus, that respond to biological but not non-biological motion.  These findings suggest that humans may have a biologically-based affinity for spotting and interpreting purposeful, biological motions.\nIn one experiment, 18-month-olds observed either a human or a mechanical arm attempting to perform actions, but failing to achieve a goal.  The children imitated the action to complete the intended goal when the arm was human, but not when it was mechanical. This suggests that from a young age, humans are able to infer intention specifically as a biological mechanism between motions and goals.Humans have a tendency to infer intention from motion, even in the absence of other distinguishing features (e.g. body shape, emotional expression). This was demonstrated in a study by Heider and Simmel; they had observers view videos of moving triangles, and found that participants tended to attribute intentions and even personality traits to the shapes based on their movements. The movement had to be animate, meaning self-propelled and non-linear.Johansson devised a way to study biological motion without interference from other characteristics of humans such as body shape, or emotional expression.  He attached dots of light to actors' joints and recorded the movements in a dark environment, so that only the dots of light were visible.  The Johansson figures, as they came to be known, have been used to demonstrate that individuals attribute mental states, such as desires and intentions to movements, that are otherwise disconnected from context.\n\n\n== Simulation theory ==\nThe simulation hypothesis holds that in order to understand intention in others, individuals must observe an action, and then infer the actor's intentions by estimating what their own actions and intentions might be in the situation. Individuals connect their own actions to internal mental states through the experience of sensory information when movements are carried out; this sensory information is stored and connected to one's own intentions. Since internal mental states, such as intention, cannot be understood directly through observing movements, it is hypothesized that these internal states are inferred based on one's own stored representations of those movements.This theory is supported by research on mirror neurons, or neural regions, including the premotor cortex, and parietal cortex, that activate both when individuals are engaging in an action, and when they are observing the actions of others. This suggests individuals may be simulating the motor movements via internal representations of their own motor movements.  Thus, research indicates that humans are hard-wired to notice biological motion, infer intention, and use previous mental representations to predict future actions of others.\n\n\n== Intentions and behaviors ==\nAlthough human behavior is extremely complex and still remains unpredictable, psychologists are trying to understand the influential factors in the process of forming intentions and performing actions. The theories of Reasoned Action and Planned Behavior are comprehensive theories that specify a limited number of psychological variables that can influence behavior, namely (a) intention; (b) attitude toward the behavior; (c) subjective norm; (d) perceived behavioral control; and (e) behavioral, normative and control beliefs. In the theory of reasoned action, intention is influenced by people's attitude toward performing the behavior and the subjective norm. However, the level of perceived control is believed to be influential on people's behavioral intention along with their attitude and subjective norms, according to the theory of planned behavior. Not surprisingly, in most studies, intention is driven by attitudes to a greater extent than by subjective norms.The predictive validity of the theory of Reasoned Action has been examined in numerous studies that have previously served as literature for at least three quantitative reviews. Ajzen and Fishbein (1973) reviewed 10 studies and reported a .63 average correlation for the prediction of behavior from intentions and a mean multiple correlation of .76 for the equation predicting intentions from both attitudes and norms. With similar objectives but larger samples, Sheppard et al.'s and van den Putte's meta-analyses estimated correlations of .53 and .62 for the prediction of behavior and multiple correlations of .66 and .68, respectively, for the prediction of intentions. All these studies have reflected the strong correlation that exists between people's attitudes, social norms and their intentions, as well as between their intention and the prediction of their behaviors. However, these correlations do not remain unchanged across all the conditions in people's life. Although people are likely to develop intentions to perform the action in question if they have a favorable attitude and perceive the behavior as controllable, then people's perception of control would be irrelevant to intentions when people have negative attitudes and perceive normative pressure not to perform certain actions. Research has also shown that people are more likely to perform an action if they have previously formed the corresponding intentions. Their intentions to perform the action appear to derive from attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. For instance, the reason you are motivated to have a few drinks after work is mostly determined by several factors. The very first one is your intention. Whether you have a positive attitude towards drinking as it can help you relieve stress and enjoy your time can greatly influence your attitude towards drinking after work. The next factor is the subjective norms around you. The level of intention to drink after work you are most likely to develop is influenced by whether significant people around you also hold favorable attitudes towards drinking and whether society tends to reward people who can drink. The last factor is the level of perceived behavioral control you have towards your intended behavior, more specifically how much confidence you have in controlling how much you will drink. If all of these factors tend to enhance your intention to have some drinks after work, you are more likely to do so. The longer you maintain the behavior of drinking after work, the stronger and more consistent your original intention will become. As a result, the greater the likelihood you will have some drinks in the future.\nHow people think about and verbally communicate their own intentions also impacts these intentions. For example, asking a question about prior behaviors using the imperfective aspect of language seems to be able to bring out stronger intentions to perform such a behavior in the future. According to the World Atlas of Language Structures, \"Imperfective Aspects\" refers to a specific form of language structure used for reference to the present and the future but also for ongoing and habitual events in the past. For example, \u2018He writes/is writing/wrote/was writing/will write letters.\u2019 People are more likely to interpret the event as ongoing, and likely to resume the action in the future when it has been described with the imperfective verb aspect. Similarly, using present tense to describe an action as ongoing may strengthen intentions to perform the same action in the future. Previous research has showed that both information on past behavior and their attitude towards such behavior play crucial roles in predicting people's future behavioral tendency. Recent research done by Carrera and others concluded that verb tense may not have direct influence on intentions, however it could still affect the type of information used as a basis of behavioral intentions. When participants described a past episode using the present tense, they consistently used the more concrete past behavior as a basis for their intentions. In contrast, when participants described a past episode using the past tense, they consistently used the more abstract attitude as a basis for their intentions.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCollective intentionality\nEntention\nIntention (criminal law)\nIntentional stance\nIntentionality\nIntentions (disambiguation)\nMotivation\nScienter\nTelos (philosophy)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Intention at Wikimedia Commons\nOnline works of Immanuel Kant on Gutenberg", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Socrates.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg"], "summary": "Intention is a mental state that represents a commitment to carrying out an action or actions in the future.

Soul or psyche (Ancient Greek: \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae psykh\u1e17, of \u03c8\u03cd\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ps\u00fdkhein, \"to breathe\", cf. Latin  'anima') comprises the mental abilities of a living being: reason, character, feeling, consciousness, qualia, memory, perception, thinking, etc. Depending on the philosophical system, a soul can either be mortal or immortal.Greek philosophers, such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, understood that the soul (\u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae ps\u016bch\u00ea) must have a logical faculty, the exercise of which was the most divine of human actions. At his defense trial, Socrates even summarized his teachings as nothing other than an exhortation for his fellow Athenians to excel in matters of the psyche since all bodily goods are dependent on such excellence (Apology 30a\u2013b).\nIn Judaism and in some Christian denominations, only human beings have immortal souls (although immortality is disputed within Judaism and the concept of immortality may have been influenced by Plato). For example, the Catholic theologian Thomas Aquinas attributed \"soul\" (anima) to all organisms but argued that only human souls are immortal. Other religions (most notably Hinduism and Jainism) hold that all living things from the smallest bacterium to the largest of mammals are the souls themselves (Atman, jiva) and have their physical representative (the body) in the world. The actual self is the soul, while the body is only a mechanism to experience the karma of that life. Thus if one see a tiger then there is a self-conscious identity residing in it (the soul), and a physical representative (the whole body of the tiger, which is observable) in the world. Some teach that even non-biological entities (such as rivers and mountains) possess souls. This belief is called animism.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe Modern English word soul, derived from Old English s\u00e1wol, s\u00e1wel which means immortal principle in man, was first attested in the 8th century poem Beowulf v. 2820 and in the Vespasian Psalter 77.50 . It is cognate with other German and Baltic terms for the same idea, including Gothic saiwala, Old High German s\u00eaula, s\u00eala, Old Saxon s\u00eaola, Old Low Franconian s\u00eala, s\u00eela, Old Norse s\u00e1la and Lithuanian siela. Deeper etymology of the Germanic word is unclear.\nThe original concept behind the Germanic root is thought to mean \u201ccoming from or belonging to the sea (or lake)\u201d, because of the Germanic and pre-Celtic belief in souls emerging from and returning to sacred lakes, Old Saxon s\u00eaola (soul) compared to Old Saxon s\u00eao (sea).\n\n\n== Synonyms ==\nThe Koine Greek Septuagint uses \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae (psyche) to translate Hebrew \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9 (nephesh), meaning \"life, vital breath\", and specifically refers to a mortal, physical life, but in English it is variously translated as \"soul, self, life, creature, person, appetite, mind, living being, desire, emotion, passion\"; an example can be found in Genesis 1:21:\n\nHebrew \u2013 \u05d5\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05bc\u05d1\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05b1\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd, \u05d0\u05b6\u05ea-\u05d4\u05b7\u05ea\u05b7\u05bc\u05e0\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05e0\u05b4\u05dd \u05d4\u05b7\u05d2\u05b0\u05bc\u05d3\u05b9\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd; \u05d5\u05b0\u05d0\u05b5\u05ea \u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05dc-\u05e0\u05b6\u05e4\u05b6\u05e9\u05c1 \u05d4\u05b7\u05d7\u05b7\u05d9\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4 \u05d4\u05b8\u05e8\u05b9\u05de\u05b6\u05e9\u05b6\u05c2\u05ea\nSeptuagint \u2013 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f10\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5\u03bd \u1f41 \u03b8\u03b5\u1f78\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03ba\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u1f74\u03bd \u03b6\u1ff4\u03c9\u03bd \u1f11\u03c1\u03c0\u03b5\u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd.\nVulgate \u2013 Creavitque Deus cete grandia, et omnem animam viventem atque motabilem.\nAuthorized King James Version \u2013 \"And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth.\"The Koine Greek word \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae (psych\u0113), \"life, spirit, consciousness\", is derived from a verb meaning \"to cool, to blow\", and hence refers to the breath, as opposed to \u03c3\u1ff6\u03bc\u03b1 (soma), meaning \"body\".

Similar ideas are found in ancient Assyrian and Babylonian religion. The Kuttamuwa stele, a funeral stele for an 8th-century BCE royal official from Sam'al, describes Kuttamuwa requesting that his mourners commemorate his life and his afterlife with feasts \"for my soul that is in this stele\". It is one of the earliest references to a soul as a separate entity from the body. The 800-pound (360 kg) basalt stele is 3 ft (0.91 m) tall and 2 ft (0.61 m) wide. It was uncovered in the third season of excavations by the Neubauer Expedition of the Oriental Institute in Chicago, Illinois.\n\n\n=== Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith ===\nThe Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith affirms that \"the soul is a sign of God, a heavenly gem whose reality the most learned of men hath failed to grasp, and whose mystery no mind, however acute, can ever hope to unravel\". Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h stated that the soul not only continues to live after the physical death of the human body, but is, in fact, immortal. Heaven can be seen partly as the soul's state of nearness to God; and hell as a state of remoteness from God. Each state follows as a natural consequence of individual efforts, or the lack thereof, to develop spiritually. Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h taught that individuals have no existence prior to their life here on earth and the soul's evolution is always towards God and away from the material world.\n\n\n=== Christianity ===\n \n\nAccording to a common Christian eschatology, when people die, their souls will be judged by God and determined to go to Heaven or to Hades awaiting the resurrection. Other Christians understand the soul as the life, and believe that the dead have no life until after the resurrection (Christian conditionalism). Some Christians believe that the souls and bodies of the unrighteous will be destroyed in Hell rather than suffering eternally (annihilationism). Believers will inherit eternal life either in Heaven, or in a Kingdom of God on earth, and enjoy eternal fellowship with God.\n\n\n==== Origin of the soul ====\n\nThe \"origin of the soul\" has provided a vexing question in Christianity. The major theories put forward include soul creationism, traducianism, and pre-existence. According to soul creationism, God creates each individual soul directly, either at the moment of conception or some later time. According to traducianism, the soul comes from the parents by natural generation. According to the preexistence theory, the soul exists before the moment of conception. There have been differing thoughts regarding whether human embryos have souls from conception, or whether there is a point between conception and birth where the fetus acquires a soul, consciousness, and/or personhood. Stances in this question might play a role in judgements on the morality of abortion.\n\n\n==== Trichotomy of the soul ====\nAugustine (354-430), one of western Christianity's most influential early Christian thinkers, described the soul as \"a special substance, endowed with reason, adapted to rule the body\". Some Christians espouse a trichotomic view of humans, which characterizes humans as consisting of a body (soma), soul (psyche), and spirit (pneuma). However, the majority of modern Bible scholars point out how the concepts of \"spirit\" and of \"soul\" are used interchangeably in many biblical passages, and so hold to dichotomy: the view that each human comprises a body and a soul. Paul said that the \"body wars against\" the soul, \"For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit\" (Heb 4:12 NASB), and that \"I buffet my body\", to keep it under control.\n\n\n==== Views of various denominations ====\nThe present Catechism of the Catholic Church states that the term soul \u201crefers to the innermost aspect of [persons], that which is of greatest value in [them], that by which [they are] most especially in God's image: \u2018soul\u2019 signifies the spiritual principle in [humanity]\u201d. All souls living and dead will be judged by Jesus Christ when he comes back to earth. The Catholic Church teaches that the existence of each individual soul is dependent wholly upon God: \"The doctrine of the faith affirms that the spiritual and immortal soul is created immediately by God.\"\n\nProtestants generally believe in the soul's existence, but fall into two major camps about what this means in terms of an afterlife. Some, following Calvin, believe in the immortality of the soul and conscious existence after death, while others, following Luther, believe in the mortality of the soul and unconscious \"sleep\" until the resurrection of the dead. Various new religious movements deriving from Adventism\u2014including Christadelphians, Seventh-day Adventists and Jehovah's Witnesses\u2014similarly believe that the dead do not possess a soul separate from the body and are unconscious until the resurrection.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches that the spirit and body together constitute the Soul of Man (Mankind). \"The spirit and the body are the soul of man.\" Latter-day Saints believe that the soul is the union of a pre-existing, God-made spirit and a temporal body, which is formed by physical conception on earth. After death, the spirit continues to live and progress in the Spirit world until the resurrection, when it is reunited with the body that once housed it. This reuniting of body and spirit results in a perfect soul that is immortal and eternal and capable of receiving a fulness of joy. Latter-day Saint cosmology also describes \"intelligences\" as the essence of consciousness or agency. These are co-eternal with God, and animate the spirits. The union of a newly-created spirit body with an eternally-existing intelligence constitutes a \"spirit birth\" and justifies God's title \"Father of our spirits\".\n\n\n=== Confucianism ===\n\nSome Confucian traditions contrast a spiritual soul with a corporeal soul.\n\n\n=== Hinduism ===\n\n\u0100tman is a Sanskrit word that means inner self or soul. In Hindu philosophy, especially in the Vedanta school of Hinduism, \u0100tman is the first principle, the true self of an individual beyond identification with phenomena, the essence of an individual. In order to attain liberation (moksha), a human being must acquire self-knowledge (atma jnana), which is to realize that one's true self (\u0100tman) is identical with the transcendent self Brahman according to Advaita Vedanta.The six orthodox schools of Hinduism believe that there is \u0100tman (self, essence) in every being.In Hinduism and Jainism, a jiva (Sanskrit: \u091c\u0940\u0935, j\u012bva, alternative spelling jiwa; Hindi: \u091c\u0940\u0935, j\u012bv, alternative spelling jeev) is a living being, or any entity imbued with a life force.The concept of jiva in Jainism is similar to atman in Hinduism. However, some Hindu traditions differentiate between the two concepts, with jiva considered as individual self, while atman as that which is universal unchanging self that is present in all living beings and everything else as the metaphysical Brahman. The latter is sometimes referred to as jiva-atman (a soul in a living body).\nAccording to Brahma Kumaris, the soul is an eternal point of light.\n\n\n=== Islam ===\n\nThe Quran, the holy book of Islam, uses two words to refer to the soul: r\u016b\u1e25 (translated as spirit, consciousness, pneuma or \"soul\") and nafs (translated as self, ego, psyche or \"soul\"), cognates of the Hebrew nefesh and ruach. The two terms are frequently used interchangeably, though r\u016b\u1e25 is more often used to denote the divine spirit or \"the breath of life\", while nafs designates one's disposition or characteristics. In Islamic philosophy, the immortal r\u016b\u1e25 \"drives\" the mortal nafs, which comprises temporal desires and perceptions necessary for living.\nTwo of the passages in the Quran that mention the r\u00fbh occur in chapters 17 (\"The Night Journey\") and 39 (\"The Troops\"):\n\nAnd they ask you, [O Muhammad], about the R\u00fbh. Say, \"The R\u00fbh is of the affair of my Lord. And mankind has not been given of knowledge except a little.\nAllah takes the souls at the time of their death, and those that do not die [He takes] during their sleep. Then He keeps those for which He has decreed death and releases the others for a specified term. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought..\n\n\n=== Jainism ===\n\nIn Jainism, every living being, from plant or bacterium to human, has a soul and the concept forms the very basis of Jainism. According to Jainism, there is no beginning or end to the existence of soul. It is eternal in nature and changes its form until it attains liberation.\nIn Jainism, jiva is the immortal essence or soul of a living organism (human, animal, fish or plant etc.) which survives physical death. The concept of Ajiva in Jainism means \"not soul\", and represents matter (including body), time, space, non-motion and motion. In Jainism, a Jiva is either samsari (mundane, caught in cycle of rebirths) or mukta (liberated).According to this belief until the time the soul is liberated from the sa\u1e43s\u0101ra (cycle of repeated birth and death), it gets attached to one of these bodies based on the karma (actions) of the individual soul. Irrespective of which state the soul is in, it has got the same attributes and qualities. The difference between the liberated and non-liberated souls is that the qualities and attributes are manifested completely in case of siddha (liberated soul) as they have overcome all the karmic bondages whereas in case of non-liberated souls they are partially exhibited. Souls who rise victorious over wicked emotions while still remaining within physical bodies are referred to as arihants.Concerning the Jain view of the soul, Virchand Gandhi said\n\nthe soul lives its own life, not for the purpose of the body, but the body lives for the purpose of the soul. If we believe that the soul is to be controlled by the body then soul misses its power.\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\nThe Hebrew terms \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9\u200e nefesh (literally \"living being\"), \u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u200e ruach (literally \"wind\"), \u05e0\u05e9\u05de\u05d4\u200e neshamah (literally \"breath\"), \u05d7\u05d9\u05d4\u200e chayah (literally \"life\") and \u05d9\u05d7\u05d9\u05d3\u05d4\u200e yechidah (literally \"singularity\") are used to describe the soul or spirit.\nIn Judaism the soul was believed to be given by God to Adam as mentioned in Genesis, Then the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being. Genesis 2:7\nJudaism relates the quality of one's soul to one's performance of the commandments (mitzvot) and reaching higher levels of understanding, and thus closeness to God. A person with such closeness is called a tzadik. Therefore, Judaism embraces the commemoration of the day of one's death, nahala/Yahrtzeit and not the birthday as a festivity of remembrance, for only toward the end of life's struggles, tests and challenges could human souls be judged and credited for righteousness. Judaism places great importance on the study of the souls.Kabbalah and other mystic traditions go into greater detail into the nature of the soul. Kabbalah separates the soul into five elements, corresponding to the five worlds:\n\nNefesh, related to natural instinct.\nRuach, related to emotion and morality.\nNeshamah, related to intellect and the awareness of God.\nChayah, considered a part of God, as it were.\nYechidah.  This aspect is essentially one with God.Kabbalah also proposed a concept of reincarnation, the gilgul. (See also nefesh habehamit the \"animal soul\".)\n\n\n=== Scientology ===\nThe Scientology view is that a person does not have a soul, it is a soul. A person is immortal, and may be reincarnated if they wish. The Scientology term for the soul is \"thetan\", derived from the Greek word \"theta\", symbolizing thought. Scientology counselling (called auditing) addresses the soul to improve abilities, both worldly and spiritual.\n\n\n=== Shamanism ===\n\nSoul dualism (also called \"multiple souls\" or \"dualistic pluralism\") is a common belief in Shamanism, and is essential in the universal and central concept of \"soul flight\" (also called \"soul journey\", \"out-of-body experience\", \"ecstasy\", or \"astral projection\"). It is the belief that humans have two or more souls, generally termed the \"body soul\" (or \"life soul\") and the \"free soul\". The former is linked to bodily functions and awareness when awake, while the latter can freely wander during sleep or trance states. In some cases, there are a plethora of soul types with different functions.Soul dualism and multiple souls are prominent in the traditional animistic beliefs of the Austronesian peoples, the Chinese people (h\u00fan and p\u00f2), the Tibetan people, most African peoples, most Native North Americans, ancient South Asian peoples, Northern Eurasian peoples, and in Ancient Egyptians (the ka and ba).The belief in soul dualism is found throughout most Austronesian shamanistic traditions. The reconstructed Proto-Austronesian word for the \"body soul\" is *nawa (\"breath\", \"life\", or \"vital spirit\"). It is located somewhere in the abdominal cavity, often in the liver or the heart (Proto-Austronesian *qaCay). The \"free soul\" is located in the head. Its names are usually derived from Proto-Austronesian *qaNiCu (\"ghost\", \"spirit [of the dead]\"), which also apply to other non-human nature spirits. The \"free soul\" is also referred to in names that literally mean \"twin\" or \"double\", from Proto-Austronesian *duSa (\"two\"). A virtuous person is said to be one whose souls are in harmony with each other, while an evil person is one whose souls are in conflict.The \"free soul\" is said to leave the body and journey to the spirit world during sleep, trance-like states, delirium, insanity, and death. The duality is also seen in the healing traditions of Austronesian shamans, where illnesses are regarded as a \"soul loss\" and thus to heal the sick, one must \"return\" the \"free soul\" (which may have been stolen by an evil spirit or got lost in the spirit world) into the body. If the \"free soul\" can not be returned, the afflicted person dies or goes permanently insane.In some ethnic groups, there can also be more than two souls. Like among the Tagbanwa people, where a person is said to have six souls \u2013 the \"free soul\" (which is regarded as the \"true\" soul) and five secondary souls with various functions.Kalbo Inuit groups believe that a person has more than one type of soul. One is associated with respiration, the other can accompany the body as a shadow. In some cases, it is connected to shamanistic beliefs among the various Inuit groups. Also Caribou Inuit groups believed in several types of souls.The shaman heals within the spiritual dimension by returning 'lost' parts of the human soul from wherever they have gone. The shaman also cleanses excess negative energies, which confuse or pollute the soul.\n\n\n=== Sikhism ===\nSikhism considers soul (atma) to be part of God (Waheguru). Various hymns are cited from the holy book Guru Granth Sahib (SGGS) that suggests this belief. \"God is in the Soul and the Soul is in the God.\" The same concept is repeated at various pages of the SGGS. For example: \"The soul is divine; divine is the soul. Worship Him with love.\" and \"The soul is the Lord, and the Lord is the soul; contemplating the Shabad, the Lord is found.\"The atma or soul according to Sikhism is an entity or \"spiritual spark\" or \"light\" in our body because of which the body can sustain life. On the departure of this entity from the body, the body becomes lifeless \u2013 No amount of manipulations to the body can make the person make any physical actions. The soul is the 'driver' in the body. It is the roohu or spirit or atma, the presence of which makes the physical body alive.\nMany religious and philosophical traditions support the view that the soul is the ethereal substance \u2013 a spirit; a non-material spark \u2013 particular to a unique living being. Such traditions often consider the soul both immortal and innately aware of its immortal nature, as well as the true basis for sentience in each living being. The concept of the soul has strong links with notions of an afterlife, but opinions may vary wildly even within a given religion as to what happens to the soul after death. Many within these religions and philosophies see the soul as immaterial, while others consider it possibly material.\n\n\n=== Taoism ===\nAccording to Chinese traditions, every person has two types of soul called hun and po (\u9b42 and \u9b44), which are respectively yang and yin. Taoism believes in ten souls, sanhunqipo (\u4e09\u9b42\u4e03\u9b44) \"three hun and seven po\". A living being that loses any of them is said to have mental illness or unconsciousness, while a dead soul may reincarnate to a disability, lower desire realms, or may even be unable to reincarnate.\n\n\n=== Zoroastrianism ===\n\n\n=== Other religious beliefs and views ===\n\nIn theological reference to the soul, the terms \"life\" and \"death\" are viewed as emphatically more definitive than the common concepts of \"biological life\" and \"biological death\". Because the soul is said to be transcendent of the material existence, and is said to have (potentially) eternal life, the death of the soul is likewise said to be an eternal death. Thus, in the concept of divine judgment, God is commonly said to have options with regard to the dispensation of souls, ranging from Heaven (i.e., angels) to hell (i.e., demons), with various concepts in between. Typically both Heaven and hell are said to be eternal, or at least far beyond a typical human concept of lifespan and time.\nAccording to Louis Ginzberg, the soul of Adam is the image of God. Every soul of human also escapes from the body every night, rises up to heaven, and fetches new life thence for the body of man.\n\n\n=== Spirituality, New Age, and new religions ===\n\n\n==== Brahma Kumaris ====\nIn Brahma Kumaris, human souls are believed to be incorporeal and eternal. God is considered to be the Supreme Soul, with maximum degrees of spiritual qualities, such as peace, love and purity.\n\n\n==== Theosophy ====\nIn Helena Blavatsky's Theosophy, the soul is the field of our psychological activity (thinking, emotions, memory, desires, will, and so on) as well as of the so-called paranormal or psychic phenomena (extrasensory perception, out-of-body experiences, etc.). However, the soul is not the highest, but a middle dimension of human beings. Higher than the soul is the spirit, which is considered to be the real self; the source of everything we call \"good\"\u2014happiness, wisdom, love, compassion, harmony, peace, etc. While the spirit is eternal and incorruptible, the soul is not. The soul acts as a link between the material body and the spiritual self, and therefore shares some characteristics of both. The soul can be attracted either towards the spiritual or towards the material realm, being thus the \"battlefield\" of good and evil. It is only when the soul is attracted towards the spiritual and merges with the Self that it becomes eternal and divine.\n\n\n==== Anthroposophy ====\nRudolf Steiner claimed classical trichotomic stages of soul development, which interpenetrated one another in consciousness:\nThe \"sentient soul\", centering on sensations, drives, and passions, with strong conative (will) and emotional components;\nThe \"intellectual\" or \"mind soul\", internalizing and reflecting on outer experience, with strong affective (feeling) and cognitive (thinking) components; and\nThe \"consciousness soul\", in search of universal, objective truths.\n\n\n==== Miscellaneous ====\nIn Surat Shabda Yoga, the soul is considered to be an exact replica and spark of the Divine. The purpose of Surat Shabd Yoga is to realize one's True Self as soul (Self-Realisation), True Essence (Spirit-Realisation) and True Divinity (God-Realisation) while living in the physical body.\nSimilarly, the spiritual teacher Meher Baba held that \"Atma, or the soul, is in reality identical with Paramatma the Oversoul \u2013 which is one, infinite, and eternal...[and] [t]he sole purpose of creation is for the soul to enjoy the infinite state of the Oversoul consciously.\"Eckankar, founded by Paul Twitchell in 1965, defines Soul as the true self; the inner, most sacred part of each person.G.I. Gurdjieff taught that humans are not born with immortal souls but could develop them through certain efforts.\n\n\n== Philosophical views ==\nThe ancient Greeks used the word \"ensouled\" to represent the concept of being \"alive\", indicating that the earliest surviving western philosophical view believed that the soul was that which gave the body life. The soul was considered the incorporeal or spiritual \"breath\" that animates (from the Latin, anima, cf. \"animal\") the living organism.\nFrancis M. Cornford quotes Pindar by saying that the soul sleeps while the limbs are active, but when one is sleeping, the soul is active and reveals \"an award of joy or sorrow drawing near\" in dreams.Erwin Rohde writes that an early pre-Pythagorean belief presented the soul as lifeless when it departed the body, and that it retired into Hades with no hope of returning to a body.\n\n\n=== Socrates and Plato ===\n\nDrawing on the words of his teacher Socrates, Plato considered the psyche to be the essence of a person, being that which decides how we behave. He considered this essence to be an incorporeal, eternal occupant of our being. Plato said that even after death, the soul exists and is able to think. He believed that as bodies die, the soul is continually reborn (metempsychosis) in subsequent bodies. However, Aristotle believed that only one part of the soul was immortal, namely the intellect (logos). The Platonic soul consists of three parts:\nthe logos, or logistikon (mind, nous, or reason)\nthe thymos, or thumetikon (emotion, spiritedness, or masculine)\nthe eros, or epithumetikon (appetitive, desire, or feminine)The parts are located in different regions of the body:\n\nlogos is located in the head, is related to reason and regulates the other part.\nthymos is located near the chest region and is related to anger.\neros is located in the stomach and is related to one's desires.Plato also compares the three parts of the soul or psyche to a societal caste system. According to Plato's theory, the three-part soul is essentially the same thing as a state's class system because, to function well, each part must contribute so that the whole functions well. Logos keeps the other functions of the soul regulated.\n\n\n=== Aristotle ===\n\nAristotle (384\u2013322 BCE) defined the soul, or Ps\u016bch\u00ea (\u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae), as the \"first actuality\" of a naturally organized body, and argued against its separate existence from the physical body. In Aristotle's view, the primary activity, or full actualization, of a living thing constitutes its soul. For example, the full actualization of an eye, as an independent organism, is to see (its purpose or final cause). Another example is that the full actualization of a human being would be living a fully functional human life in accordance with reason (which he considered to be a faculty unique to humanity). For Aristotle, the soul is the organization of the form and matter of a natural being which allows it to strive for its full actualization. This organization between form and matter is necessary for any activity, or functionality, to be possible in a natural being. Using an artifact (non-natural being) as an example, a house is a building for human habituation, but for a house to be actualized requires the material (wood, nails, bricks, etc.) necessary for its actuality (i.e. being a fully functional house). However, this does not imply that a house has a soul. In regards to artifacts, the source of motion that is required for their full actualization is outside of themselves (for example, a builder builds a house). In natural beings, this source of motion is contained within the being itself. Aristotle elaborates on this point when he addresses the faculties of the soul.\nThe various faculties of the soul, such as nutrition, movement (peculiar to animals), reason (peculiar to humans), sensation (special, common, and incidental) and so forth, when exercised, constitute the \"second\" actuality, or fulfillment, of the capacity to be alive. For example, someone who falls asleep, as opposed to someone who falls dead, can wake up and live their life, while the latter can no longer do so.\nAristotle identified three hierarchical levels of natural beings: plants, animals, and people, having three different degrees of soul: Bios (life), Zo\u00eb (animate life), and Psuch\u00eb (self-conscious life). For these groups, he identified three corresponding levels of soul, or biological activity: the nutritive activity of growth, sustenance and reproduction which all life shares (Bios); the self-willed motive activity and sensory faculties, which only animals and people have in common (Zo\u00eb); and finally \"reason\", of which people alone are capable (Pseuch\u00eb).\nAristotle's discussion of the soul is in his work, De Anima (On the Soul). Although mostly seen as opposing Plato in regard to the immortality of the soul, a controversy can be found in relation to the fifth chapter of the third book: in this text both interpretations can be argued for, soul as a whole can be deemed mortal, and a part called \"active intellect\" or \"active mind\" is immortal and eternal. Advocates exist for both sides of the controversy, but it has been understood that there will be permanent disagreement about its final conclusions, as no other Aristotelian text contains this specific point, and this part of De Anima is obscure. Further, Aristotle states that the soul helps humans find the truth, and understanding the true purpose or role of the soul is extremely difficult.\n\n\n=== Avicenna and Ibn al-Nafis ===\nFollowing Aristotle, Avicenna (Ibn Sina) and Ibn al-Nafis, an Arab physician, further elaborated upon the Aristotelian understanding of the soul and developed their own theories on the soul. They both made a distinction between the soul and the spirit, and the Avicennian doctrine on the nature of the soul was influential among the Scholastics. Some of Avicenna's views on the soul include the idea that the immortality of the soul is a consequence of its nature, and not a purpose for it to fulfill. In his theory of \"The Ten Intellects\", he viewed the human soul as the tenth and final intellect.While he was imprisoned, Avicenna wrote his famous \"Floating man\" thought experiment to demonstrate human self-awareness and the substantial nature of the soul. He told his readers to imagine themselves suspended in the air, isolated from all sensations, which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies. He argues that in this scenario one would still have self-consciousness. He thus concludes that the idea of the self is not logically dependent on any physical thing, and that the soul should not be seen in relative terms, but as a primary given, a substance. This argument was later refined and simplified by Ren\u00e9 Descartes in epistemic terms, when he stated: \"I can abstract from the supposition of all external things, but not from the supposition of my own consciousness.\"Avicenna generally supported Aristotle's idea of the soul originating from the heart, whereas Ibn al-Nafis rejected this idea and instead argued that the soul \"is related to the entirety and not to one or a few organs\". He further criticized Aristotle's idea whereby every unique soul requires the existence of a unique source, in this case the heart. Al-Nafis concluded that \"the soul is related primarily neither to the spirit nor to any organ, but rather to the entire matter whose temperament is prepared to receive that soul,\" and he defined the soul as nothing other than \"what a human indicates by saying \"I\".\n\n\n=== Thomas Aquinas ===\nFollowing Aristotle (whom he referred to as \"the Philosopher\") and Avicenna, Thomas Aquinas (1225\u201374) understood the soul to be the first actuality of the living body. Consequent to this, he distinguished three orders of life: plants, which feed and grow; animals, which add sensation to the operations of plants; and humans, which add intellect to the operations of animals.\nConcerning the human soul, his epistemological theory required that, since the knower becomes what he knows, the soul is definitely not corporeal\u2014if it is corporeal when it knows what some corporeal thing is, that thing would come to be within it. Therefore, the soul has an operation which does not rely on a body organ, and therefore the soul can exist without a body. Furthermore, since the rational soul of human beings is a subsistent form and not something made of matter and form, it cannot be destroyed in any natural process. The full argument for the immortality of the soul and Aquinas' elaboration of Aristotelian theory is found in Question 75 of the First Part of the Summa Theologica.\n\n\n=== Immanuel Kant ===\nIn his discussions of rational psychology, Immanuel Kant (1724\u20131804) identified the soul as the \"I\" in the strictest sense, and argued that the existence of inner experience can neither be proved nor disproved.\n\nWe cannot prove a priori the immateriality of the soul, but rather only so much: that all properties and actions of the soul cannot be recognized from materiality. It is from the \"I\", or soul, that Kant proposes transcendental rationalization, but cautions that such rationalization can only determine the limits of knowledge if it is to remain practical.\n\n\n=== Philosophy of mind ===\n\nGilbert Ryle's ghost in the machine argument, which is a rejection of Descartes' mind\u2013body dualism, can provide a contemporary understanding of the soul/mind, and the problem concerning its connection to the brain/body.\n\n\n=== James Hillman ===\nPsychologist James Hillman's archetypal psychology is an attempt to restore the concept of the soul, which Hillman viewed as the \"self-sustaining and imagining substrate\" upon which consciousness rests. Hillman described the soul as that \"which makes meaning possible, [deepens] events into experiences, is communicated in love, and has a religious concern\", as well as \"a special relation with death\". Departing from the Cartesian dualism \"between outer tangible reality and inner states of mind\", Hillman takes the Neoplatonic stance that there is a \"third, middle position\" in which soul resides. Archetypal psychology acknowledges this third position by attuning to, and often accepting, the archetypes, dreams, myths, and even psychopathologies through which, in Hillman's view, soul expresses itself.\n\n\n=== Psychology ===\nSoul belief prominently figues in Otto Rank's work recovering the importance of immortality in the psychology of primitive, classical and modern interest in life and death.  Rank's work directly opposed the \"scientific\" psychology that concedes the possibility of the soul's existence and postulates it as an object of research without really admitting that it exists. \"Just as religion represents a psychological commentary on the social evolution of man, various psychologies represent our current attitudes toward spiritual belief. In the animistic era, psychologizing was a creating of the soul; in the religious era, it was a representing of the soul to one's self; in our era of natural science it is a knowing of the individual soul.\"   Rank's \"Seelenglaube\" translates to \"Soul Belief\". Rank's work had a significant influence on Ernest Becker's understanding of a universal interest in immortality.  In Denial of Death, Becker describes \"soul\" in terms of Kierkegaard's use of \"self\" when he says, \"what we call schizophrenia is an attempt by the symbolic self to deny the limitations of the finite body.\"\n\u2020 Kierkegaard\u2019s use of \"self\u201d may be a bit confusing. He uses it to includethe symbolic self and the physical body. It is a synonym really for \u201ctotal\npersonality\u201d that goes beyond the person to include what we would now call\nthe \"soul\u201d or the \"ground of being\u201d out of which the created person sprang.\n\n\n== Science ==\nMany modern scientists, such as Julien Musolino, hold that the mind is merely a complex machine that operates on the same physical laws as all other objects in the universe. According to Musolino, there is currently no scientific evidence whatsoever to support the existence of the soul and there is considerable evidence that seems to indicate that souls do not exist.The search for the soul, however, is seen to have been instrumental in driving the understanding of the anatomy and physiology of the human body, particularly in the fields of cardiovascular and neurology. In the two dominant conflicting concepts of the soul \u2013 one seeing it to be spiritual and immortal, and the other seeing it to be material and mortal, both have described the soul as being located in a particular organ or as pervading the whole body.\n\n\n=== Neuroscience ===\nNeuroscience as an interdisciplinary field, and its branch of cognitive neuroscience particularly, operates under the ontological assumption of physicalism. In other words, it assumes that only the fundamental phenomena studied by physics exist. Thus, neuroscience seeks to understand mental phenomena within the framework according to which human thought and behavior are caused solely by physical processes taking place inside the brain, and it operates by the way of reductionism by seeking an explanation for the mind in terms of brain activity.To study the mind in terms of the brain several methods of functional neuroimaging are used to study the neuroanatomical correlates of various cognitive processes that constitute the mind. The evidence from brain imaging indicates that all processes of the mind have physical correlates in brain function. However, such correlational studies cannot determine whether neural activity plays a causal role in the occurrence of these cognitive processes (correlation does not imply causation) and they cannot determine if the neural activity is either necessary or sufficient for such processes to occur. Identification of causation, and of necessary and sufficient conditions requires explicit experimental manipulation of that activity. If manipulation of brain activity changes consciousness, then a causal role for that brain activity can be inferred. Two of the most common types of manipulation experiments are loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments. In a loss-of-function (also called \"necessity\") experiment, a part of the nervous system is diminished or removed in an attempt to determine if it is necessary for a certain process to occur, and in a gain-of-function (also called \"sufficiency\") experiment, an aspect of the nervous system is increased relative to normal. Manipulations of brain activity can be performed with direct electrical brain stimulation, magnetic brain stimulation using transcranial magnetic stimulation, psychopharmacological manipulation, optogenetic manipulation, and by studying the symptoms of brain damage (case studies) and lesions. In addition, neuroscientists are also investigating how the mind develops with the development of the brain.\n\n\n=== Physics ===\nPhysicist Sean M. Carroll has written that the idea of a soul is incompatible with quantum field theory (QFT). He writes that for a soul to exist: \"Not only is new physics required, but dramatically new physics. Within QFT, there can't be a new collection of 'spirit particles' and 'spirit forces' that interact with our regular atoms, because we would have detected them in existing experiments.\"Some theorists have invoked quantum indeterminism as an explanatory mechanism for possible soul/brain interaction, but neuroscientist Peter Clarke found errors with this viewpoint, noting there is no evidence that such processes play a role in brain function; Clarke concluded that a Cartesian soul has no basis from quantum physics.\n\n\n== Parapsychology ==\nSome parapsychologists have attempted to establish, by scientific experiment, whether a soul separate from the brain exists, as is more commonly defined in religion rather than as a synonym of psyche or mind. Milbourne Christopher (1979) and Mary Roach (2010) have argued that none of the attempts by parapsychologists have yet succeeded.\n\n\n=== Weight of the soul ===\nIn 1901 Duncan MacDougall conducted an experiment in which he made weight measurements of patients as they died. He claimed that there was weight loss of varying amounts at the time of death; he concluded the soul weighed 21 grams, based on measurements of a single patient and discarding conflicting results. The physicist Robert L. Park has written that MacDougall's experiments \"are not regarded today as having any scientific merit\" and the psychologist Bruce Hood wrote that \"because the weight loss was not reliable or replicable, his findings were unscientific.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBatchelor, Stephen.

Soul or psyche (Ancient Greek: \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae psykh\u1e17, of \u03c8\u03cd\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd ps\u00fdkhein, \"to breathe\", cf. Latin  'anima') comprises the mental abilities of a living being: reason, character, feeling, consciousness, qualia, memory, perception, thinking, etc. Depending on the philosophical system, a soul can either be mortal or immortal.Greek philosophers, such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, understood that the soul (\u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u03ae ps\u016bch\u00ea) must have a logical faculty, the exercise of which was the most divine of human actions. At his defense trial, Socrates even summarized his teachings as nothing other than an exhortation for his fellow Athenians to excel in matters of the psyche since all bodily goods are dependent on such excellence (Apology 30a\u2013b).\nIn Judaism and in some Christian denominations, only human beings have immortal souls (although immortality is disputed within Judaism and the concept of immortality may have been influenced by Plato). For example, the Catholic theologian Thomas Aquinas attributed \"soul\" (anima) to all organisms but argued that only human souls are immortal. Other religions (most notably Hinduism and Jainism) hold that all living things from the smallest bacterium to the largest of mammals are the souls themselves (Atman, jiva) and have their physical representative (the body) in the world. The actual self is the soul, while the body is only a mechanism to experience the karma of that life. Thus if one see a tiger then there is a self-conscious identity residing in it (the soul), and a physical representative (the whole body of the tiger, which is observable) in the world. Some teach that even non-biological entities (such as rivers and mountains) possess souls.

Typically, adherents of such religions believe the ETs to be interested in the welfare of humanity which either already is, or eventually will become, part of a pre-existing ET civilization. Others may incorporate ETs into a more supernatural worldview in which the UFO occupants are more akin to angels than physical aliens; this distinction may be blurred within the overall subculture. These religions have their roots in the tropes of early science fiction (especially space opera) and weird fiction writings, in ufology, and in the subculture of UFO sightings and alien abduction stories.\n\n\n== Summary ==\nSome adherents believe that the arrival or rediscovery of alien civilizations, technologies and spirituality will enable humans to overcome current ecological, spiritual and social problems. Issues such as hatred, war, bigotry, poverty and so on are said to be resolvable through the use of superior alien technology and spiritual abilities. Such belief systems are also described as millenarian in their outlook.UFO religions developed first in such countries as the United States, Canada, France, the United Kingdom and Japan as the concept presumes the cultural context of a society technologically advanced enough to conceive of ET as such and one in which religion of any kind is not discouraged or suppressed. The term \"flying saucers\" and the popular notion of the UFO originated in 1947. The 1950s saw the creation of UFO religions, with the advent of the purported contactees.\n\n\n== Notable UFO religions ==\n\n\n=== Aetherius Society ===\n\nThe Aetherius Society was founded in the United Kingdom in 1955. Its founder, George King, claimed to have been contacted telepathically by an alien intelligence called Aetherius, who represented an \"Interplanetary Parliament.\" According to Aetherians, their society acts as a vehicle through which \"Cosmic Transmissions of advanced metaphysical significance\" can be disseminated to humanity. These \"transmissions\" were recorded on magnetic reel-to-reel tape by persons present during each \"telepathic transmission\" as George King sat in a state of \"Samadhi\" and the \"transmission\" was \"delivered\" via his own voicebox. In 1956 and 1957, and on occasion before a public audience, several of these \"transmissions\" forecast flying saucer activity in specific parts of the world on certain dates (You Are Responsible! Aetherius Society 1961). Shortly after these dates, newspapers, such as the Sunday Times and The Daily Telegraph, reported sightings which coincided with the dates and locations forecast in these \"transmissions\". As a spiritual teacher, George King taught certain yoga practices, spiritual healing, Eastern mantra and \"dynamic prayer\"\u2014tools for spiritual self-advancement and service to the world\u2014which the Aetherius Society is principally based upon.\n\n\n=== Church of the SubGenius ===\n\nFounded in 1979 with the publication of SubGenius Pamphlet #1 by Ivan Stang and Philo Drummond, the Church of the SubGenius has been known as a \"parody religion\" due to its extensive use of comedy and parody. In spite of this, the organization claims over 10,000 followers worldwide who have paid $30 to become \"ordained SubGenius ministers\", and it has been embraced by many skeptic and atheist groups. With the publication of The Book of the SubGenius in 1983, the Church of the SubGenius prophesied that its founder, J.R. \"Bob\" Dobbs, was in contact with an exterrestrial race called the Xists (\"X-ists\"), and these Xists were scheduled to launch a worldwide invasion of Earth on July 5, 1998.  (See also: X-Day (Church of the SubGenius))  The day of the scheduled invasion came and went without an appearance by the Xists, but church members remain unconvinced. The church now holds annual \"X-Day\" celebrations on July 5 of every year. The church also claims that its members are not entirely human, having descended from the Yeti.\n\n\n=== Heaven's Gate ===\n\nThe Heaven's Gate group achieved notoriety in 1997 when founder Marshall Applewhite convinced 38 followers to commit mass suicide. Members reportedly believed themselves to be aliens, awaiting a spaceship that would arrive with Comet Hale-Bopp. The suicide was undertaken in the apparent belief that their souls would be transported onto the spaceship, which they thought was hiding behind the comet. They underwent elaborate preparations for their trip, including purchasing and wearing matching shoes and living in a darkened house to simulate the long journey they expected to have in outer space.\n\n\n=== Nation of Islam ===\n\nThe Nation of Islam subscribes to the belief that UFOs are man-made machines that are piloted not by extraterrestrial beings, but by humans. It is believed that these machines will have a hand in the Day of Judgment. Its late leader Elijah Muhammed claimed that the biblical Book of Ezekiel describes a \"Mother Plane\" or great \"Wheel\". Elijah reported in his books that his mentor, Wallace Fard Muhammad, claimed that there was hidden technology on the Earth which selected scientists all around the world are secretly aware of. Fard explained that he had had a huge \"Mother Plane\" or \"Wheel\" constructed on the island of Nippon (Japan) in 1929. The movement's current leader, Louis Farrakhan, describes the \"Mother Plane\" thus:\n\nThe Honorable Elijah Muhammad told us of a giant Motherplane that is made like the universe, spheres within spheres. White people call them unidentified flying objects (UFOs). Ezekiel, in the Old Testament, saw a wheel that looked like a cloud by day but a pillar of fire by night. The Hon. Elijah Muhammad said that that wheel was built on the island of Nippon, which is now called Japan, by some of the original scientists. It took 15 billion dollars in gold at that time to build it. It is made of the toughest steel. America does not yet know the composition of the steel used to make an instrument like it. It is a circular plane, and the Bible says that it never makes turns. Because of its circular nature it can stop and travel in all directions at speeds of thousands of miles per hour. He said there are 1,500 small wheels in this mother wheel which is a half mile by a half mile (800 by 800 m). This Mother Wheel is like a small human built planet. Each one of these small planes carry three bombs.\n\n\n=== Ra\u00eblism ===\n\nThe International Ra\u00eblian Movement has been described as \"the largest UFO religion in the world.\" Ra\u00eblians believe that scientifically advanced extraterrestrials, known as the Elohim, created life on Earth through genetic engineering, and that a combination of human cloning and \"mind transfer\" can ultimately provide eternal life. Past religious teachers, like Jesus, Buddha and Muhammad, are said to have been sent by these scientifically advanced extraterrestrials to teach humanity. The Elohim are said to be planning a future visit to complete their revelation and education of humanity.Ra\u00eblian Priest Thomas said on this topic, \"The difference between Ra\u00eblians and Heaven's Gate and Jim Jones etc., is that the others destructively believed in a God who would give them a better life after death, just like most believers in a monotheistic religion do today, and hence the risk for suicide chasing afterlife rewards \u2026 as Ra\u00eblians we want the best right now in our life, who would want to die now in that scenario with all those pleasures to enjoy? Ra\u00eblians believe in enjoying life now, with happiness and laughter.\"\n\n\n=== Scientology ===\n\nScientology has been discussed in the context of UFO religions in UFO Religions by Christopher Partridge, The Encyclopedic Sourcebook of UFO Religions by James R. Lewis, and UFO Religion: Inside Flying Saucer Cults and Culture by Gregory Reece. Stories of extraterrestrial civilizations and interventions in past lives form a part of the belief system of Scientology. The most well-known story publicized and held up to ridicule by critics is that of Xenu, the ruler of the Galactic Confederacy who is said to have brought billions of frozen people to Earth 75 million years ago and placed them near a number of volcanoes, and dropped hydrogen bombs into them, thus killing the entire population in an effort to solve overpopulation. The spirits of these people were then captured by Xenu and mass implanted with numerous suggestions and then \"packaged\" into clusters of spirits.From the early 1950s onwards, Scientology's founder, L. Ron Hubbard, published a number of books, lectures, and other works describing what he termed \"space opera\".Scientology teaches that all humans have experienced innumerable past lives, including lives in ancient advanced extraterrestrial societies, such as Helatrobus and the Marcabians. Traumatic memories from these past lives are said to be the cause of many present-day physical and mental ailments. Scientologists also believe that human beings possess superhuman powers which cannot be restored until they have been fully rehabilitated as spiritual beings through the practice of \"auditing\", using methods set out by Hubbard in his various works.According to Hubbard, a thetan (the Scientology term for a soul) has a body. When that body dies the thetan goes to a \"landing station\" on the planet Venus, where they are re-implanted and are programmed to forget their previous lifetimes. The Venusians then \"capsule\" each thetan and send them back to Earth to be dumped into the Gulf of California; whereupon, each thetan searches for a new body to inhabit. To avoid these inconveniences, Hubbard advised Scientologists to simply refuse to go to Venus after their death.\n\n\n=== Unarius Academy of Science ===\n\nFounded by Ernest L. Norman and his wife, Ruth, in 1954, the Unarians are a group headquartered in El Cajon, California, who believe that, through the use of Four-dimensional space physics, they are able to communicate with supposed advanced intelligent beings that allegedly exist on \"higher frequency\" planes. Unarians believe in past lives and hold that the Solar System was once inhabited by ancient interplanetary civilizations.\n\n\n=== Universal Industrial Church of the New World Comforter ===\nThe Universal Industrial Church of the New World Comforter is a UFO religion founded in 1967 by Allen Michael. Michael claimed that in 1947, under his birth name Allen Noonan, while he was a pictorial sign painter in Long Beach, California, he was contacted by the Great Galactic Being that was manifesting itself as the Milky Way galaxy. He was asked to serve as the spiritual Comforter and preach supernatural truth to the world. During his services Michael often quoted from and provided his interpretations of the Bible. In 1967 in the Haight and Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco, he founded the One World Family Commune as a pilot model of living that he was preaching as the Comforter. He claimed to have physically encountered a flying saucer in 1954 at Giant Rock in the Mojave Desert of California. During the Summer of Love, he began the One World Family Commune opening a vegan restaurant  on the northeast corner of Haight and Scott streets in San Francisco, California, called the Here and Now. 7 similar restaurants followed. In 1969, the commune established a vegan restaurant in a much larger space on Telegraph Avenue and Haste Street in Berkeley and the name of the restaurant was changed to Mustard Seed and late became One World Family Natural Food Center, which also included a bakery, a pizzeria, a clothing store and an assembly room for public events. They lived in two adjacent houses that are now home to the Lothlorien house of the Berkeley Student Cooperative. The commune published a vegetarian cookbook called Cosmic Cookery. There was a large mural on the side of the restaurant painted by Allen Michael that had written above it the phrase Farmers, Workers, Soldiers Unite \u2014 The People's Spiritual Reformation 1776\u20131976! The farmer was holding a pitchfork, the worker was holding a hammer, and the soldier was holding a gun, and they had their arms around each other's shoulders. Above the three were three flying saucers coming in for a landing. In 1973, Allen Michael founded \"The Universal Industrial Church of the New World Comforter\" and published the first volume of his channeled revelations, The Everlasting Gospel. In 1975, the church headquarters and the vegetarian restaurant relocated to Stockton, California. Allen Noonan ran for president of the United States in the 1980 and 1984 elections on the Utopian Synthesis Party ticket.\n\n\n=== Universe People ===\n\nThe Universe People or Cosmic people of light powers (Czech: Vesm\u00edrn\u00ed lid\u00e9 sil sv\u011btla) is a Czech movement centered around Ivo A. Benda. Its belief system is based upon the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations communicating with Benda and other \"contacters\" since October 1997 telepathically and later by direct personal contact. According to Benda, those civilizations operate a fleet of spaceships led by Ashtar (sometimes written Ashtar Sheran) orbiting and closely watching the Earth, helping the good and waiting to transport the followers into another dimension. The Universe People teaching incorporates various elements from ufology (some foreign \"contacters\" are credited, though often also renounced after a time as misguided or deceptive), Christianity (Jesus was a \"fine-vibrations\" being) and conspiracy theories (forces of evil are supposed to plan compulsory chipping of the populace).\n\n\n== UFOs in other Non-UFO religions ==\n\n\n=== Ascended Master Teachings ===\nThe Ascended Master Teachings are a group of religions based on Theosophy. In the traditional Ascended Master Teachings of Guy Ballard and Elizabeth Clare Prophet, no mention is made of UFOs or flying saucers. However, the Ascended Master Teachings teacher Joshua David Stone in his teachings began, beginning in 1993, to refer to Ashtar, believed by some UFO enthusiasts to be the commander of a flying saucer fleet called the \"Ashtar Galactic Command\" that operates near Earth (manned mostly by Venusians), as a Master along with the more traditional ascended masters. He continued to include \"Ashtar\" on his list of ascended masters that he mentioned he received dictations from when speaking at his yearly Wesak Festival Mount Shasta gatherings that began to be held in 1996. Stone also taught that the Master Jesus, under his \"galactic\" name Sananda, sometimes rides with \"Commander Ashtar\" in his flying saucer fleet.\n\n\n=== Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ===\n\nAccording to Mormon scripture, the Earth's is just one of many inhabited worlds, and there are many governing heavenly bodies, including the planet or star Kolob, which is said to be nearest the throne of God.\n\n\n=== Share International and Maitreya ===\nThe Theosophical-influenced guru Benjamin Creme of Share International claimed that the Messiah figure he referred to as Maitreya is in telepathic contact with Nordic aliens. Creme believed that Nordic aliens live on the etheric plane of Venus and visited earth in flying saucers. Creme accepted George Adamski's UFO sightings as valid. According to Creme, the Venusians have mother ships up to four miles long. It is also believed by the Theosophists in general as well as Creme in particular that the governing deity of Earth, Sanat Kumara (who is believed to live in a city called Shamballa located above the Gobi desert on the etheric plane of Earth), is a Nordic alien who originally came from Venus 18,500,000 years ago. The followers of Benjamin Creme believe there is regular flying saucer traffic between Venus and Shamballah and that crop circles are mostly caused by flying saucers.\n\n\n=== Tempelhofgesellschaft ===\nA neo-Nazi esoteric Nazi Gnostic sect headquartered in Vienna, Austria, called the Tempelhofgesellschaft, founded in the early 1990s, teaches what it calls a form of Marcionism. They distribute pamphlets claiming that the Aryan race originally came to Atlantis from the star Aldebaran (this information is supposedly based on \"ancient Sumerian manuscripts\"). They maintain that the Aryans from Aldebaran derive their power from the vril energy of the Black Sun. They teach that since the Aryan race is of extraterrestrial origin it has a divine mission to dominate all the other races. It is believed by adherents of this religion that an enormous space fleet is on its way to Earth from Aldebaran which, when it arrives, will join forces with the \"Nazi Flying Saucers from Antarctica\" to establish the Western Imperium.\n\n\n=== Training centre for release of the Atma-energy ===\nThis sect was originally a splinter group of the Brahma Kumaris and is known for a police and media scare in which an alleged attempt to commit ritual suicide took place in Teide National Park in Tenerife in 1998. Apparently, the 32 members of the sect believed that they would be collected by a spacecraft and taken to an unspecified destination.\n\n\n=== Worldwide Community of the New Message from God ===\nThe New Message from God is at once both a set of teachings with claims of divine authority and the new religious movement that promotes these teachings. It is entirely based on the work of Marshall Vian Summers, who is granted elevated status as \"the Messenger\" on the basis of these teachings. Summers and his adherents represent that he is a prophet on the order of the Buddha, Jesus, and Muhammad, in receipt of an unworldly communication having salvific power for individuals and for the planet among others in a populated universe. Summers has recorded these communications on tape, the transcription approaching ten thousand pages. Key components of this communication include warnings of an incursion upon Earth called the Intervention, and pronouncements about the future involving global upheaval and interaction between the human race and extraterrestrials which, Summers claims, are from \"the Greater Community.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nDoomsday cult\nList of new religious movements\nList of Ufologists\nList of UFO organizations\nList of UFO religions\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nLewis, James R.

contamination of a planetary body by a space probe or spacecraft, either deliberate or unintentional.\nThere are two types of interplanetary contamination:\n\nForward contamination is the transfer of life and other forms of contamination from Earth to another celestial body.\nBack contamination is the introduction of extraterrestrial organisms and other forms of contamination into Earth's biosphere. It also covers infection of humans and human habitats in space and on other celestial bodies by extraterrestrial organisms, if such habitats exist.The main focus is on microbial life and on potentially invasive species. Non-biological forms of contamination have also been considered, including contamination of sensitive deposits (such as lunar polar ice deposits) of scientific interest. In the case of back contamination, multicellular life is thought unlikely but has not been ruled out. In the case of forward contamination, contamination by multicellular life (e.g. lichens) is unlikely to occur for robotic missions, but it becomes a consideration in crewed missions to Mars.Current space missions are governed by the Outer Space Treaty and the COSPAR guidelines for planetary protection. Forward contamination is prevented primarily by sterilizing the spacecraft. In the case of sample-return missions (back contamination) the aim of the mission is to return extraterrestrial samples to Earth, and sterilization of the samples would make them of much less interest. So, back contamination would be prevented mainly by containment, and breaking the chain of contact between the planet of origin and Earth. It would also require quarantine procedures for the materials and for anyone who comes into contact with them.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nMost of the Solar System appears hostile to life as we know it. No extraterrestrial life has ever been discovered, but there are several locations outside Earth where microbial life could possibly exist, have existed, or thrive if introduced. If extraterrestrial life exists, it may be vulnerable to interplanetary contamination by foreign microorganisms. Some extremophiles may be able to survive space travel to another planet, and foreign life could possibly be introduced by spacecraft from Earth and transform the location from its current pristine state. This poses scientific and ethical concerns.\nLocations within the Solar System where life might exist today include the oceans of liquid water beneath the icy surface of Europa, Enceladus,\nand Titan (its surface has oceans of liquid ethane / methane, but it may also have liquid water below the surface and ice volcanoes).There are multiple consequences for both forward- and back-contamination. If a planet becomes contaminated with Earth life, it might then be difficult to tell whether any lifeforms discovered originated there or came from Earth. Furthermore, the organic chemicals produced by the introduced life would confuse sensitive searches for biosignatures of living or ancient native life. The same applies to other more complex biosignatures. Life on other planets could have a common origin with Earth life, since in the early Solar System there was much exchange of material between the planets which could have transferred life as well. If so, it might be based on nucleic acids too (RNA or DNA).\nThe majority of the species isolated are not well understood or characterized and cannot be cultured in labs, and are known only from DNA fragments obtained with swabs. On a contaminated planet, it might be difficult to distinguish the DNA of extraterrestrial life from the DNA of life brought to the planet by the exploring. Most species of microorganism on Earth are not yet well understood or DNA sequenced. This particularly applies to the unculturable archaea, and so are difficult to study. This can be either because they depend on the presence of other microorganisms, or are slow growing, or depend on other conditions not yet understood. In typical habitats, 99% of microorganisms are not culturable.  Introduced Earth life could contaminate resources of value for future human missions, such as water.Invasive species could outcompete native life or consume it, if there is life on the planet. One argument against this is that the native life would be more adapted to the conditions there. However, the experience on Earth shows that species moved from one continent to another may be able to outcompete the native life adapted to that continent. Additionally, evolutionary processes on Earth might have developed biological pathways different from extraterrestrial organisms, and so may be able to out-compete it. The same is also possible the other way around for back contamination introduced to Earth's biosphere.\nIn addition of science concerns, ethical or moral issues have also been raised on accidental and intentional interplanetary transport of life.\n\n\n== Evidence for possible habitats outside Earth ==\nEnceladus and Europa show the best evidence for current habitats, mainly due to the possibility of their hosting liquid water and organic compounds.\n\n\n=== Mars ===\n\nThere is ample evidence to suggest that Mars once offered habitable conditions for microbial life. It is therefore possible that microbial life may have existed on Mars, although no evidence has been found.It is thought that many bacterial spores (endospores) from Earth were transported on Mars spacecraft. Some may be protected within Martian rovers and landers on the shallow surface of the planet. In that sense, Mars may have already been interplanetarily contaminated.\nCertain lichens from the arctic permafrost are able to photosynthesize and grow in the absence of any liquid water, simply by using the humidity from the atmosphere. They are also highly tolerant of UV radiation, using melanin and other more specialized chemicals to protect their cells.Although numerous studies point to resistance to some of Mars conditions, they do so separately, and none has considered the full range of Martian surface conditions, including temperature, pressure, atmospheric composition, radiation, humidity, oxidizing regolith, and others, all at the same time and in combination. Laboratory simulations show that whenever multiple lethal factors are combined, the survival rates plummet quickly.Other studies have suggested the potential for life to survive using deliquescing salts. These, similarly to the lichens, use the humidity of the atmosphere. If the mixture of salts is right, the organisms may obtain liquid water at times of high atmospheric humidity, with salts capture enough to be capable of supporting life.\nResearch published in July 2017 shows that when irradiated with a simulated Martian UV flux, perchlorates become even more lethal to bacteria (bactericide effect). Even dormant spores lost viability within minutes. In addition, two other compounds of the Martian surface, iron oxides and hydrogen peroxide, act in synergy with irradiated perchlorates to cause a 10.8-fold increase in cell death when compared to cells exposed to UV radiation after 60\u2009seconds of exposure.  It was also found that abraded silicates (quartz and basalt) lead to the formation of toxic reactive oxygen species. The researchers concluded that \"the surface of Mars is lethal to vegetative cells and renders much of the surface and near-surface regions uninhabitable.\" This research demonstrates that the present-day surface is more uninhabitable than previously thought, and reinforces the notion to inspect at least a few meters into the ground to ensure the levels of radiation would be relatively low.\n\n\n=== Enceladus ===\nThe Cassini spacecraft directly sampled the plumes escaping from Enceladus. Measured data indicates that these geysers are made primarily of salt rich particles with an 'ocean-like' composition, which is thought to originate from a subsurface ocean of liquid saltwater, rather than from the moon's icy surface. Data from the geyser flythroughs also indicate the presence of organic chemicals in the plumes. Heat scans of Enceladus' surface also indicate warmer temperatures around the fissures where the geysers originate from, with temperatures reaching \u221293 \u00b0C (\u2212135 \u00b0F), which is 115 \u00b0C (207 \u00b0F) warmer than the surrounding surface regions.\n\n\n=== Europa ===\nEuropa has much indirect evidence for its sub-surface ocean. Models of how Europa is affected by tidal heating require a subsurface layer of liquid water in order to accurately reproduce the linear fracturing of the surface. Indeed, observations by the Galileo spacecraft of how Europa's magnetic field interacts with Jupiter's field strengthens the case for a liquid, rather than solid, layer; an electrically conductive fluid deep within Europa would explain these results. Observations from the Hubble Space Telescope in December 2012 appear to show an ice plume spouting from Europa's surface, which would immensely strengthen the case for a liquid subsurface ocean. As was the case for Enceladus, vapour geysers would allow for easy sampling of the liquid layer. Unfortunately, there appears to be little evidence that geysering is a frequent event on Europa due to the lack of water in the space near Europa.\n\n\n== Planetary protection ==\n\nForward contamination is prevented by sterilizing space probes sent to sensitive areas of the Solar System. Missions are classified depending on whether their destinations are of interest for the search for life, and whether there is any chance that Earth life could reproduce there.\nNASA made these policies official with the issuing of Management Manual NMI-4-4-1, NASA Unmanned Spacecraft Decontamination Policy on September 9, 1963.  Prior to NMI-4-4-1 the same sterilization requirements were required on all outgoing spacecraft regardless of their target.  Difficulties in the sterilization of Ranger probes sent to the Moon are the primary reasons for NASA's change to a target-by-target basis in assessing the likelihood forward contamination.\nSome destinations such as Mercury need no precautions at all. Others such as the Moon require documentation but nothing more, while destinations such as Mars require sterilization of the rovers sent there. For the details, see Planetary protection.\nBack contamination would be prevented by containment or quarantine. However, there have been no sample-returns thought to have any possibility of a back contamination risk since the Apollo missions. The Apollo regulations have been rescinded and new regulations have yet to be developed, see Suggested precautions for sample-returns\n\n\n== Crewed spacecraft ==\nCrewed spacecraft are of particular concern for interplanetary contamination because of the impossibility to sterilize a human to the same level as a robotic spacecraft. Therefore, the chance of forwarding contamination is higher than for a robotic mission. Humans are typically host to a hundred trillion microorganisms in ten thousand species in the human microbiome which cannot be removed while preserving the life of the human. Containment seems the only option, but effective containment to the same standard as a robotic rover appears difficult to achieve with present-day technology. In particular, adequate containment in the event of a hard landing is a major challenge.\nHuman explorers may be potential carriers back to Earth of microorganisms acquired on Mars, if such microorganisms exist. Another issue is the contamination of the water supply by Earth microorganisms shed by humans in their stools, skin and breath, which could have a direct effect on the long-term human colonization of Mars.\n\n\n== The Moon as a testbed ==\nThe Moon has been suggested as a testbed for new technology to protect sites in the Solar System, and astronauts, from forward and back contamination. Currently, the Moon has no contamination restrictions because it is considered to be \"not of interest\" for prebiotic chemistry and origins of life.  Analysis of the contamination left by the Apollo program astronauts could also yield useful ground truth for planetary protection models.\n\n\n== Non-contaminating exploration methods ==\n\nOne of the most reliable ways to reduce the risk of forward and back contamination during visits to extraterrestrial bodies is to use only Robotic spacecraft. Humans in close orbit around the target planet could control equipment on the surface in real time via telepresence, so bringing many of the benefits of a surface mission, without its associated increased forward and back contamination risks.\n\n\n== Back contamination issues ==\nSince the Moon is now generally considered to be free from life, the most likely source of contamination would be from Mars during either a Mars sample-return mission or as a result of a crewed mission to Mars. The possibility of new human pathogens, or environmental disruption due to back contamination, is considered to be of extremely low probability but cannot yet be ruled out.\nThere are no immediate plans for a Mars sample-return, but it remains a high priority for NASA and the ESA because of its great potential biological and geological interest. The European Space Foundation report cites many advantages of a Mars sample-return. In particular, it would permit extensive analyses on Earth, without the size and weight constraints for instruments sent to Mars on rovers. These analyses could also be carried out without the communication delays for experiments carried out by Martian rovers. It would also make it possible to repeat experiments in multiple laboratories with different instruments to confirm key results.Carl Sagan was first to publicise back contamination issues that might follow from a Mars sample-return. In Cosmic Connection (1973) he wrote:\n\nPrecisely because Mars is an environment of great potential biological interest, it is possible that on Mars there are pathogens, organisms which, if transported to the terrestrial environment, might do enormous biological damage.\nLater in Cosmos (1980) Carl Sagan wrote:\n\nPerhaps Martian samples can be safely returned to Earth. But I would want to be very sure before considering a returned-sample mission.\nNASA and ESA views are similar. The findings were that with present-day technology, Martian samples can be safely returned to Earth provided the right precautions are taken.\n\n\n=== Suggested precautions for sample-returns ===\nNASA has already had experience with returning samples thought to represent a low back contamination risk when samples were returned for the first time by Apollo 11. At the time, it was thought that there was a low probability of life on the Moon, so the requirements were not very stringent. The precautions taken then were inadequate by current standards, however. The regulations used then have been rescinded, and new regulations and approaches for a sample-return would be needed.\n\n\n==== Chain of contact ====\nA sample-return mission would be designed to break the chain of contact between Mars and the exterior of the sample container, for instance, by sealing the returned container inside another larger container in the vacuum of space before it returns to Earth. In order to eliminate the risk of parachute failure, the capsule could fall at terminal velocity and the impact would be cushioned by the capsule's thermal protection system. The sample container would be designed to withstand the force of the impact.\n\n\n==== Receiving facility ====\n\nTo receive, analyze and curate extraterrestrial soil samples, NASA has proposed to build a biohazard containment facility, tentatively known as the Mars Sample Return Receiving Facility (MSRRF). This future facility must be rated biohazard level 4 (BSL-4). While existing BSL-4 facilities deal primarily with fairly well-known organisms, a BSL-4 facility focused on extraterrestrial samples must pre-plan the systems carefully while being mindful that there will be unforeseen issues during sample evaluation and curation that will require independent thinking and solutions.The facility's systems must be able to contain unknown biohazards, as the sizes of any putative Martian microorganisms are unknown. In consideration of this, additional requirements were proposed. Ideally it should filter particles of 0.01 \u00b5m or larger, and release of a particle 0.05 \u00b5m or larger is unacceptable under any circumstance.The reason for this extremely small size limit of 0.01 \u00b5m is for consideration of gene transfer agents (GTAs) which are virus-like particles that are produced by some microorganisms that package random segments of DNA capable of horizontal gene transfer. These randomly incorporate segments of the host genome and can transfer them to other evolutionarily distant hosts, and do that without killing the new host. In this way many archaea and bacteria can swap DNA with each other. This raises the possibility that Martian life, if it has a common origin with Earth life in the distant past, could swap DNA with Earth microorganisms in the same way. In one experiment reported in 2010, researchers left GTAs (DNA conferring antibiotic resistance) and marine bacteria overnight in natural conditions and found that by the next day up to 47% of the bacteria had incorporated the genetic material from the GTAs. Another reason for the 0.05 \u00b5m limit is because of the discovery of ultramicrobacteria as small as 0.2 \u00b5m across.The BSL-4 containment facility must also double as a cleanroom to preserve the science value of the samples. A challenge is that, while it is relatively easy to simply contain the samples once returned to Earth, researchers would also want to remove parts of the sample and perform analyses. During all these handling procedures, the samples would need to be protected from Earthly contamination. A cleanroom is normally kept at a higher pressure than the external environment to keep contaminants out, while a biohazard laboratory is kept at a lower pressure to keep the biohazards in. This would require to compartmentalize the specialized rooms in order to combine these in a single building. Solutions suggested include a triple walled containment facility, and one of the suggestions include extensive robotic handling of the samples.The facility would be expected to take 7 to 10 years from design to completion, and an additional two years is recommended for the staff to become accustomed to the facilities.\n\n\n==== Dissenting views on back contamination ====\nRobert Zubrin, from the Mars Society, maintains that the risk of back contamination is negligible. He supports this using an argument based on the possibility of transfer of life from Earth to Mars on meteorites.\n\n\n==== Legal process of approval for Mars sample-return ====\nMargaret Race has examined in detail the legal process of approval for a MSR. She found that under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (which did not exist in the Apollo era) a formal environment impact statement is likely to be required, and public hearings during which all the issues would be aired openly. This process is likely to take up to several years to complete.\nDuring this process, she found, the full range of worst accident scenarios, impact, and project alternatives would be played out in the public arena. Other agencies such as the Environment Protection Agency, Occupational Health and Safety Administration, etc., may also get involved in the decision making process.\nThe laws on quarantine will also need to be clarified as the regulations for the Apollo program were rescinded. In the Apollo era, NASA delayed announcement of its quarantine regulations until the day Apollo was launched, so bypassing the requirement for public debate - something that would be unlikely to be tolerated today.\nIt is also probable that the presidential directive NSC-25 will apply which requires a review of large scale alleged effects on the environment and is carried out subsequent to the other domestic reviews and through a long process, leads eventually to presidential approval of the launch.\nThen apart from those domestic legal hurdles, there are numerous international regulations and treaties to be negotiated in the case of a Mars sample-return, especially those relating to environmental protection and health. She concluded that the public of necessity has a significant role to play in the development of the policies governing Mars sample-return.\n\n\n=== Alternatives to sample-returns ===\nSeveral exobiologists have suggested that a Mars sample-return is not necessary at this stage, and that it is better to focus more on in situ studies on the surface first. Although it is not their main motivation, this approach of course also eliminates back contamination risks.\nSome of these exobiologists advocate more in situ studies followed by a sample-return in the near future. Others go as far as to advocate in situ study instead of a sample-return at the present state of understanding of Mars.Their reasoning is that life on Mars is likely to be hard to find. Any present day life is likely to be sparse and occur in only a few niche habitats. Past life is likely to be degraded by cosmic radiation over geological time periods if exposed in the top few meters of the Mars surface. Also, only certain special deposits of salts or clays on Mars would have the capability to preserve organics for billions of years. So, they argue, there is a high risk that a Mars sample-return at our current stage of understanding would return samples that are no more conclusive about the origins of life on Mars or present day life than the Martian meteorite samples we already have.\nAnother consideration is the difficulty of keeping the sample completely free from Earth life contamination during the return journey and during handling procedures on Earth. This might make it hard to show conclusively that any biosignatures detected does not result from contamination of the samples.\nInstead they advocate sending more sensitive instruments on Mars surface rovers. These could examine many different rocks and soil types, and search for biosignatures on the surface and so examine a wide range of materials which could not all be returned to Earth with current technology at reasonable cost.\nA sample-return to Earth would then be considered at a later stage, once we have a reasonably thorough understanding of conditions on Mars, and possibly have already detected life there, either current or past life, through biosignatures and other in situ analyses.\n\n\n==== Instruments under development for in situ analyses ====\nNASA Marshall Space Flight Center is leading a research effort to develop a Miniaturized Variable Pressure Scanning Electron Microscope (MVP-SEM) for future lunar and Martian missions.Several teams, including Jonathan Rothberg, and J. Craig Venter, are separately developing solutions for sequencing alien DNA directly on the Martian surface itself.\nLevin is working on updated versions of the Labeled release instrument flown on Viking. For instance versions that rely on detecting chirality. This is of special interest because it can enable detection of life even if it is not based on standard life chemistry.\nThe Urey Mars Organic and Oxidant Detector instrument for detection of biosignatures has been descoped, but was due to be flown on ExoMars in 2018. It is designed with much higher levels of sensitivity for biosignatures than any previous instruments\n\n\n==== Study and analyses from orbit ====\nDuring the \u201cExploration Telerobotics Symposium\" in 2012 experts on telerobotics from industry, NASA and academics met to discuss telerobotics, and its applications to space exploration. Amongst other issues, particular attention was given to Mars missions and a Mars sample-return.\nThey came to the conclusion that telerobotic approaches could permit direct study of the samples on the Mars surface via telepresence from Mars orbit, permitting rapid exploration and use of human cognition to take advantage of chance discoveries and feedback from the results obtained so far.They found that telepresence exploration of Mars has many advantages. The astronauts have near real-time control of the robots, and can respond immediately to discoveries. It also prevents contamination both ways and has mobility benefits as well.Return of the sample to orbit has the advantage that it permits analysis of the sample without delay, to detect volatiles that may be lost during a voyage home. This was the conclusion of a meeting of researchers at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in 2012.\n\nSimilar methods could be used to directly explore other biologically sensitive moons such as Europa, Titan, or Enceladus, once the human presence in the vicinity becomes possible.\n\n\n== Forward contamination ==\n\n\n=== The 2019 Beresheet incident ===\nIn August 2019, scientists reported that a capsule containing tardigrades (a resilient microbial animal) in a cryptobiotic state may have survived for a while on the Moon after the April 2019 crash landing of Beresheet, a failed Israeli lunar lander.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/75/NIAID_Integrated_Research_Facility_-_Positive_Pressure_Personnel_Suit.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Teleroboitcs_image2.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/Telerobotics_image1_large.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg"], "summary": "Interplanetary contamination refers to biological contamination of a planetary body by a space probe or spacecraft, either deliberate or unintentional.\nThere are two types of interplanetary contamination:\n\nForward contamination is the transfer of life and other forms of contamination from Earth to another celestial body.\nBack contamination is the introduction of extraterrestrial organisms and other forms of contamination into Earth's biosphere.

First published in 2005, it sold 5 million copies in North America by 2009. In 2008 it was selected for Oprah's Book Club and featured in a series of 10 weekly webinars with Tolle and Oprah Winfrey.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nAn article in Success magazine describes A New Earth as a \"self-improvement book\" that encourages its readers to live their lives in each present moment and to create happiness for themselves without emphasizing material possessions.  Tolle's intent is to change the way human beings think, and he envisions a world population that is increasingly humble, enlightened and pure. According to Tolle, the book's purpose \"is not to add new information or beliefs to your mind or to try to convince you of anything, but to bring about a shift in consciousness\".In the book,  Tolle asserts that everyone can find \"the freedom and joy of life\" if they live in the present moment. The book describes human dysfunction, selfishness, anxiety and the inhumanity we inflict on each other, as well as mankind's failed attempts to find life meaning and purpose through material possessions and unhealthy relationships.  It asserts that thoughts can have a powerful and beneficial \"effect on the healing process\", and puts forth a concept of \"evolutionary transformation of human consciousness\" which prompts the reader to participate in \"honest self-evaluation [that] can lead to positive change.\"\n\n\n== Synopsis ==\nEarly chapters of the book give simple explanations and provide a foundation for further concepts and ideas. In \"Chapter One: The Flowering of Human Consciousness\", Tolle discusses the \"inherent dysfunction in humanity\" and proposes ways that readers may rise above it.  He then develops these concepts in chapters two, three and four by offering his descriptions of the ego and its \"vices.\" In the book, Tolle defines the term ego as an \"illusory sense of self\" based on one's memories and thoughts.  In chapters five and six Tolle uses the phrase pain body to describe the human tendency to carry \"an accumulation of old emotional pain\". In chapters seven, eight and nine: \"Inner Space, Inner Purpose and Who You Truly Are\", Tolle makes many distinctions: between \"knowing yourself and knowing about yourself\"; between the \"Dreamer\" and the \"dream\"; between the objects of consciousness and the space of consciousness; between outer space and inner space; and between outer purpose and inner purpose. In chapter ten, \"A New Earth\", Tolle gives his readers suggestions for implementation of his ideas in their personal life but cautions them by saying:  \"You are still an ordinary human. What is extraordinary is what comes through you into this world\".\n\n\n== Reception ==\nOprah Winfrey selected A New Earth for her book club in January 2008, and in March it was featured in a series of ten weekly webinars broadcast on Winfrey's website. By March 23, 2008 the book had reached number one on the New York Times Best Seller list for \"Paperback Advice\". According to Barnes & Noble, the book became the fastest-selling title in the history of Oprah's Book Club, out of the 61 selections since the book club's inception in 1996. Within four weeks of the book-club announcement 3.5 million copies had been shipped.   By 2009, an estimated 5 million copies had been sold in North America. Some Christian readers have criticized the book, saying that it states that a person can control their own destiny rather than God necessarily doing so. In addition, a journalist for SUCCESS magazine wrote in August 2008 that some readers reported having a difficult time understanding and incorporating Tolle's message into their lives.The book was originally published in 2005 by the Dutton/Penguin Group. Its second printing was published in 2006 by Plume publishing. A third printing was published 2008 by the Penguin Group. A New Earth is also available as an unabridged audiobook, read by the author.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPosi music\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nA New Earth at Official Website of Eckhart Tolle\nStudy materials (webcasts, transcripts, workbook, meditations) at Oprah.com", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f9/A_New_Earth_by_Eckhart_Tolle.png"], "summary": "A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life\u2019s Purpose is a self-help book by Eckhart Tolle.
