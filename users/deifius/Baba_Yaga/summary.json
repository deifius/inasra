"In Slavic folklore, Baba Yaga (; Russian: \u0411\u0430\u0431\u0430-\u042f\u0433\u0430, tr. B\u00e1ba-Jag\u00e1, IPA: [\u02c8bab\u0259 j\u026a\u02c8\u0261a] (listen)) is a supernatural being (or a trio of sisters of the same name) who appears as a deformed or ferocious-looking old woman. In Slavic culture, Baba Yaga lived in a hut usually described as standing on chicken legs.Baba Yaga may help or hinder those that encounter her or seek her out. She may play a maternal role and has associations with forest wildlife. According to Vladimir Propp's folktale morphology, Baba Yaga commonly appears as either a donor, villain, or may be altogether ambiguous. Her depictions vary greatly across tales, ranging from a child-eating monster, to helping a protagonist find his missing bride.\nAndreas Johns identifies Baba Yaga as \"one of the most memorable and distinctive figures in eastern European folklore\", and observes that she is \"enigmatic\" and often exhibits \"striking ambiguity\". Johns summarizes Baba Yaga as \"a many-faceted figure, capable of inspiring researchers to see her as a Cloud, Moon, Death, Winter, Snake, Bird, Pelican or Earth Goddess, totemic matriarchal ancestress, female initiator, phallic mother, or archetypal image\".\n\n"
