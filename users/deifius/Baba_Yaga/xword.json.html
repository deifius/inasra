B\u00e1ba-Jag\u00e1, IPA: [\u02c8bab\u0259 j\u026a\u02c8\u0261a] (listen)) is a supernatural being (or a trio of sisters of the same name) who appears as a deformed or ferocious-looking old woman. In Slavic culture, Baba Yaga lived in a hut usually described as standing on chicken legs.Baba Yaga may help or hinder those that encounter her or seek her out. She may play a maternal role and has associations with forest wildlife. According to Vladimir Propp's folktale morphology, Baba Yaga commonly appears as either a donor, villain, or may be altogether ambiguous. Her depictions vary greatly across tales, ranging from a child-eating monster, to helping a protagonist find his missing bride.\nAndreas Johns identifies Baba Yaga as \"one of the most memorable and distinctive figures in eastern European folklore\", and observes that she is \"enigmatic\" and often exhibits \"striking ambiguity\". Johns summarizes Baba Yaga as \"a many-faceted figure, capable of inspiring researchers to see her as a Cloud, Moon, Death, Winter, Snake, Bird, Pelican or Earth Goddess, totemic matriarchal ancestress, female initiator, phallic mother, or archetypal image\".\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nVariations of the name Baba Yaga are found in the languages of the Eastern Slavic peoples. The first element, baba, is transparently a babble word. In Old Russian, baba may mean \"midwife\", \"sorceress\", or \"fortune teller\". In modern Russian, the word \u0431\u0430\u0431\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430 or babushka (meaning \"grandmother\") derives from it, as does the word babcia (also \"grandmother\") in Polish. In Serbo-Croatian and Bulgarian, baba means \"grandma\". In contemporary, unofficial Polish and Russian baba is the pejorative synonym of \"woman\" (especially old, dirty or foolish woman). Baba may also have a pejorative connotation in modern Russian, both for women as well as for \"an unmanly, timid, or characterless man\". Similarly to other kinship terms in Slavic languages, baba may be employed outside of kinship, potentially as a result of taboo. For example, in variety of Slavic languages and dialects, the word baba may be applied to various animals, natural phenomena, and objects, such as types of mushrooms, cake or pear. This function extends to various geographic features. In the Polesia region of Ukraine, the plural baby may refer to an autumn funeral feast.These associations have led to variety of theories on the figure of Baba Yaga, though the presence of the element baba may have simply been taken as its primary meaning of \"grandmother\" or \"old woman\". The element may appear as a means of glossing the second element, iaga, with a familiar component. Additionally, baba may have also been applied as a means of distinguishing Baba Yaga from a male counterpart.While a variety of etymologies have been proposed for the second element of the name, Yaga, it remains far more etymologically problematic and no clear consensus among scholars has resulted. For example, in the 19th century, Alexander Afanasyev proposed the derivation of Proto-Slavic *o\u017e and Sanskrit ahi ('serpent, snake'). This etymology has subsequently been explored by other scholars in the 20th century.Related terms to the second element of the name, Yaga, appear in various Slavic languages; Serbo-Croatian jeza (\"horror\", \"shudder\", \"chill\"), Slovene jeza (\"anger\"), Old Czech j\u011bz\u011b (\"witch\", \"legendary evil female being\"), modern Czech jezinka (\"wicked wood nymph\", \"dryad\"), and Polish j\u0119dza (\"witch\", \"evil woman\", \"fury\"). The term appears in Old Church Slavonic as j\u0119za/j\u0119dza (meaning \"disease\", \"illness\"). In other Indo-European languages the element iaga has been linked to Lithuanian engti (\"to abuse (continuously)\", \"to belittle\", \"to exploit\"), Old English inca (\"doubt\", \"worry\", \"pain\"), and Old Norse ekki (\"pain\", \"worry\").\n\n\n== Attestations ==\n\nAs noted by Lithuanian scholar Marija Gimbutas, the character of Baba Yaga shows considerable ambiguity: she is described as a witch with cannibalistic tendencies, with preference for children in some accounts, while in others she is a wise prophetess who gives guidance to heroes.\n\n\n=== Folktales ===\nAs one of the most famous witches, Baba Yaga has appeared in hundreds if not thousands of folktales in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus predating the eighteenth century. The first clear reference to Baba Yaga (Iaga baba) occurs in 1755; Mikhail V. Lomonosov's Rossiiskaia grammatika ('Russian grammar'). In Lomonosov's grammar, Baba Yaga is mentioned twice among other figures largely from Slavic tradition. The second of the two mentions occurs within a list of Slavic gods and beings next to their presumed equivalence in Roman mythology (the Slavic god Perun, for example, appears equated with the Roman god Jupiter). Baba Yaga, however, appears in a third section without an equivalence, attesting to perception of her uniqueness even in this first known attestation. However, it is noticeable that, like Hecate, Baba Yaga presides over a wide, diverse array of domains and functions.\nIn the narratives in which Baba Yaga appears, she displays a variety of typical attributes: a turning, chicken-legged hut; and a mortar, pestle, mop or broom. Baba Yaga frequently bears the epithet \"bony leg\" (Baba Iaga kostianaia noga), and when inside of her dwelling, she may be found stretched out over the stove, reaching from one corner of the hut to another. Baba Yaga may sense and mention the \"Russian scent\" (russkim dukhom) of those that visit her. Her nose may stick into the ceiling. Particular emphasis may be placed by some narrators on the repulsiveness of her nose.In many tales, there are three Baba Yagas which are often depicted as sisters. For example, in a version of \"The Maiden Tsar\" collected in the 19th century by Alexander Afanasyev, Ivan, a handsome merchant's son, makes his way to the home of one of three Baba Yagas:\n\nHe journeyed onwards, straight ahead .. and finally came to a little hut; it stood in the open field, turning on chicken legs. He entered and found Baba Yaga the Bony-legged. \"Fie, fie,\" she said, \"the Russian smell was never heard of nor caught sight of here, but it has come by itself. Are you here of your own free will or by compulsion, my good youth?\" \"Largely of my own free will, and twice as much by compulsion! Do you know, Baba Yaga, where lies the thrice tenth kingdom?\" \"No, I do not,\" she said, and told him to go to her second sister; she might know.\n\nIvan walks for some time before encountering a small hut identical to the first. This Baba Yaga makes the same comments and asks the same question as the first, and Ivan asks the same question. This second Baba Yaga does not know either and directs him to the third, but says that if she gets angry with him \"and wants to devour you, take three horns from her and ask her permission to blow them; blow the first one softly, the second one louder, and third still louder\". Ivan thanks her and continues on his journey.After walking for some time, Ivan eventually finds the chicken-legged hut of the youngest of the three sisters turning in an open field. This third and youngest of the Baba Yagas makes the same comment about \"the Russian smell\" before running to whet her teeth and consume Ivan. Ivan begs her to give him three horns and she does so. The first he blows softly, the second louder, and the third louder yet. This causes birds of all sorts to arrive and swarm the hut. One of the birds is the firebird, which tells him to hop on its back or Baba Yaga will eat him. He does so and the Baba Yaga rushes him and grabs the firebird by its tail. The firebird leaves with Ivan, leaving Baba Yaga behind with a fist full of firebird feathers.In Afanasyev's collection of tales, Baba Yaga also appears in \"The Magic Swan Geese\", \"Baba Yaga and Zamoryshek\", \"By Command of the Prince Daniel\", \"Vasilisa the Fair\", \"Marya Moryevna\", \"Realms of Copper, Silver, and Gold\", \"The Sea Tsar and Vasilisa the Wise\", and \"Legless Knight and Blind Knight\" (English titles from Magnus's translation).\nIn some of these tales, a Baba Yaga will die only to rise again in another form.\n\n\n=== Lubki ===\n\nBaba Yaga appears on a variety of lubki (singular lubok), wood block prints popular in late 17th and early 18th century Russia. In some instances, Baba Yaga appears astride a pig going to battle against a reptilian entity described as a \"crocodile\". Some scholars interpret this scene as a political parody. Peter the Great persecuted Old Believers, who in turn referred to him as a \"crocodile\". Some instances of the lubki feature a ship below the crocodile, and Baba Yaga appears in what some scholars identify as Finnish dress, and Catherine I, Peter the Great's wife, was sometimes derisively referred to by way of a word referring to Finnish women (Russian chukhonka).Another lubok features Baba Yaga dancing with a bagpipe-playing bald man. In turn, some scholars have identified this as a merrier depiction of the home life of Peter the Great and Catherine I. Alternately, some scholars have interpreted these lubki motifs as reflecting a concept of Baba Yaga as a shaman, according to which the \"crocodile\" would represent a monster who fights witches. The print would therefore be something of a \"cultural m\u00e9lange\" that \"demonstrate[s] an interest in shamanism at the time\". Contemporary to the production of the lubki, the Finnic peoples still practiced a form of shamanism.According to scholar Andreas Johns, \"Neither of these two interpretations significantly changes the image of Baba Yaga familiar from folktales. Either she can be seen as a literal evil witch, treated somewhat humorously in these prints, or as a figurative 'witch', an unpopular foreign empress. Both literal and figurative understandings of Baba Yaga are documented in the nineteenth century and were probably present at the time these prints were made.\"\n\n\n== Related figures and analogues ==\nJe\u017eibaba, a figure closely related to Baba Yaga, occurs in the folklore of the West Slavic peoples. The name Je\u017eibaba and its variants are directly related to that of Baba Yaga. The two figures may stem from a common figure as far back as the medieval period, if not further, and both figures are at times similarly ambiguous. The two differ in their occurrence in different tale types and in details regarding their appearances. Questions linger regarding the limited Slavic area\u2014East Slavic nations, Slovakia, and the Czech lands\u2014in which references to Je\u017eibaba are recorded. Another related figure appears in Polish folklore by the name of Jedza.Scholars have identified a variety of beings in folklore who share similarities of varying extent with Baba Yaga. These similarities may be due to either direct relation or cultural contact between the Eastern Slavs and other surrounding peoples. In Central and Eastern Europe, these figures include the Bulgarian gorska maika (\u0413\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0439\u043a\u0430', 'Forest Mother', also the name of a flower); the Hungarian vasorr\u00fa b\u00e1ba ('Iron-nose Midwife'), the Serbian Baba Korizma, Gvozdenzuba ('Iron-tooth'), Baba Roga (used to scare children in Bosnia, Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia), \u0161umska majka ('Forest Mother'), and the babice; and the Slovenian jaga baba or je\u017eibaba, Pehta or Pehtra baba and kvatrna baba or kvatrnica. In Romanian folklore, similarities have been identified in several figures, including Mama padurii ('Forest Mother'). In neighboring Germanic Europe, similarities have been observed between the Alpine Perchta and Holda or Holle in the folklore of Central and Northern Germany, and the Swiss Chlungeri.Some scholars have proposed that the concept of Baba Yaga was influenced by East Slavic contact with Finno-Ugric and Siberian peoples. The Karelian Sy\u00f6j\u00e4t\u00e4r has some aspects of Baba Yaga, but only the negative ones, while in other Karelian tales, helpful roles akin to those from Baba Yaga may be performed by a character called akka (Karelian for \"old woman\").\n\n\n== Modern influence ==\n\"The Hut on Fowl's Legs (Baba Yaga)\" is the title of a piece in Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition.\nShe is mentioned in the Marvel Cinematic Universe by a friend of Ant Man.\nIn 1899, the illustrator Ivan Bilibin depicted Baba Yaga in his illustrations for \"Vasilisa the Beautiful\", a Russian folktale collected in Alexander Afanasyev's Narodnye russkie skazki.\nBaba Yaga's Assistant written by Marika McCoola; illustrated by Emily Carroll.\nIn the novel Ask Baba Yaga: Otherworldly Advice for Everyday Troubles by Taisia Kitaiskaia, the character of Baba Yaga gives advice for contemporary life.\nBaba Yaga appears as a character in the book The Door By the Staircase by Katherine Marsh; illustrated by Kelly Murphy.\nIn the animated series Arthur, Baba Yaga is among the creatures of folklore that the character Sue Ellen suspects after she and her friends hear a strange noise in the woods.

In Slavic culture, Baba Yaga lived in a hut usually described as standing on chicken legs.Baba Yaga may help or hinder those that encounter her or seek her out. She may play a maternal role and has associations with forest wildlife. According to Vladimir Propp's folktale morphology, Baba Yaga commonly appears as either a donor, villain, or may be altogether ambiguous. Her depictions vary greatly across tales, ranging from a child-eating monster, to helping a protagonist find his missing bride.\nAndreas Johns identifies Baba Yaga as \"one of the most memorable and distinctive figures in eastern European folklore\", and observes that she is \"enigmatic\" and often exhibits \"striking ambiguity\". Johns summarizes Baba Yaga as \"a many-faceted figure, capable of inspiring researchers to see her as a Cloud, Moon, Death, Winter, Snake, Bird, Pelican or Earth Goddess, totemic matriarchal ancestress, female initiator, phallic mother, or archetypal image\".\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nVariations of the name Baba Yaga are found in the languages of the Eastern Slavic peoples. The first element, baba, is transparently a babble word. In Old Russian, baba may mean \"midwife\", \"sorceress\", or \"fortune teller\". In modern Russian, the word \u0431\u0430\u0431\u0443\u0448\u043a\u0430 or babushka (meaning \"grandmother\") derives from it, as does the word babcia (also \"grandmother\") in Polish. In Serbo-Croatian and Bulgarian, baba means \"grandma\". In contemporary, unofficial Polish and Russian baba is the pejorative synonym of \"woman\" (especially old, dirty or foolish woman). Baba may also have a pejorative connotation in modern Russian, both for women as well as for \"an unmanly, timid, or characterless man\". Similarly to other kinship terms in Slavic languages, baba may be employed outside of kinship, potentially as a result of taboo. For example, in variety of Slavic languages and dialects, the word baba may be applied to various animals, natural phenomena, and objects, such as types of mushrooms, cake or pear. This function extends to various geographic features. In the Polesia region of Ukraine, the plural baby may refer to an autumn funeral feast.These associations have led to variety of theories on the figure of Baba Yaga, though the presence of the element baba may have simply been taken as its primary meaning of \"grandmother\" or \"old woman\". The element may appear as a means of glossing the second element, iaga, with a familiar component. Additionally, baba may have also been applied as a means of distinguishing Baba Yaga from a male counterpart.While a variety of etymologies have been proposed for the second element of the name, Yaga, it remains far more etymologically problematic and no clear consensus among scholars has resulted. For example, in the 19th century, Alexander Afanasyev proposed the derivation of Proto-Slavic *o\u017e and Sanskrit ahi ('serpent, snake'). This etymology has subsequently been explored by other scholars in the 20th century.Related terms to the second element of the name, Yaga, appear in various Slavic languages; Serbo-Croatian jeza (\"horror\", \"shudder\", \"chill\"), Slovene jeza (\"anger\"), Old Czech j\u011bz\u011b (\"witch\", \"legendary evil female being\"), modern Czech jezinka (\"wicked wood nymph\", \"dryad\"), and Polish j\u0119dza (\"witch\", \"evil woman\", \"fury\"). The term appears in Old Church Slavonic as j\u0119za/j\u0119dza (meaning \"disease\", \"illness\"). In other Indo-European languages the element iaga has been linked to Lithuanian engti (\"to abuse (continuously)\", \"to belittle\", \"to exploit\"), Old English inca (\"doubt\", \"worry\", \"pain\"), and Old Norse ekki (\"pain\", \"worry\").\n\n\n== Attestations ==\n\nAs noted by Lithuanian scholar Marija Gimbutas, the character of Baba Yaga shows considerable ambiguity: she is described as a witch with cannibalistic tendencies, with preference for children in some accounts, while in others she is a wise prophetess who gives guidance to heroes.\n\n\n=== Folktales ===\nAs one of the most famous witches, Baba Yaga has appeared in hundreds if not thousands of folktales in Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus predating the eighteenth century. The first clear reference to Baba Yaga (Iaga baba) occurs in 1755; Mikhail V. Lomonosov's Rossiiskaia grammatika ('Russian grammar'). In Lomonosov's grammar, Baba Yaga is mentioned twice among other figures largely from Slavic tradition. The second of the two mentions occurs within a list of Slavic gods and beings next to their presumed equivalence in Roman mythology (the Slavic god Perun, for example, appears equated with the Roman god Jupiter). Baba Yaga, however, appears in a third section without an equivalence, attesting to perception of her uniqueness even in this first known attestation. However, it is noticeable that, like Hecate, Baba Yaga presides over a wide, diverse array of domains and functions.\nIn the narratives in which Baba Yaga appears, she displays a variety of typical attributes: a turning, chicken-legged hut; and a mortar, pestle, mop or broom. Baba Yaga frequently bears the epithet \"bony leg\" (Baba Iaga kostianaia noga), and when inside of her dwelling, she may be found stretched out over the stove, reaching from one corner of the hut to another. Baba Yaga may sense and mention the \"Russian scent\" (russkim dukhom) of those that visit her. Her nose may stick into the ceiling. Particular emphasis may be placed by some narrators on the repulsiveness of her nose.In many tales, there are three Baba Yagas which are often depicted as sisters. For example, in a version of \"The Maiden Tsar\" collected in the 19th century by Alexander Afanasyev, Ivan, a handsome merchant's son, makes his way to the home of one of three Baba Yagas:\n\nHe journeyed onwards, straight ahead .. and finally came to a little hut; it stood in the open field, turning on chicken legs. He entered and found Baba Yaga the Bony-legged. \"Fie, fie,\" she said, \"the Russian smell was never heard of nor caught sight of here, but it has come by itself. Are you here of your own free will or by compulsion, my good youth?\" \"Largely of my own free will, and twice as much by compulsion! Do you know, Baba Yaga, where lies the thrice tenth kingdom?\" \"No, I do not,\" she said, and told him to go to her second sister; she might know.\n\nIvan walks for some time before encountering a small hut identical to the first. This Baba Yaga makes the same comments and asks the same question as the first, and Ivan asks the same question. This second Baba Yaga does not know either and directs him to the third, but says that if she gets angry with him \"and wants to devour you, take three horns from her and ask her permission to blow them; blow the first one softly, the second one louder, and third still louder\". Ivan thanks her and continues on his journey.After walking for some time, Ivan eventually finds the chicken-legged hut of the youngest of the three sisters turning in an open field. This third and youngest of the Baba Yagas makes the same comment about \"the Russian smell\" before running to whet her teeth and consume Ivan. Ivan begs her to give him three horns and she does so. The first he blows softly, the second louder, and the third louder yet. This causes birds of all sorts to arrive and swarm the hut. One of the birds is the firebird, which tells him to hop on its back or Baba Yaga will eat him. He does so and the Baba Yaga rushes him and grabs the firebird by its tail. The firebird leaves with Ivan, leaving Baba Yaga behind with a fist full of firebird feathers.In Afanasyev's collection of tales, Baba Yaga also appears in \"The Magic Swan Geese\", \"Baba Yaga and Zamoryshek\", \"By Command of the Prince Daniel\", \"Vasilisa the Fair\", \"Marya Moryevna\", \"Realms of Copper, Silver, and Gold\", \"The Sea Tsar and Vasilisa the Wise\", and \"Legless Knight and Blind Knight\" (English titles from Magnus's translation).\nIn some of these tales, a Baba Yaga will die only to rise again in another form.\n\n\n=== Lubki ===\n\nBaba Yaga appears on a variety of lubki (singular lubok), wood block prints popular in late 17th and early 18th century Russia. In some instances, Baba Yaga appears astride a pig going to battle against a reptilian entity described as a \"crocodile\". Some scholars interpret this scene as a political parody. Peter the Great persecuted Old Believers, who in turn referred to him as a \"crocodile\". Some instances of the lubki feature a ship below the crocodile, and Baba Yaga appears in what some scholars identify as Finnish dress, and Catherine I, Peter the Great's wife, was sometimes derisively referred to by way of a word referring to Finnish women (Russian chukhonka).Another lubok features Baba Yaga dancing with a bagpipe-playing bald man. In turn, some scholars have identified this as a merrier depiction of the home life of Peter the Great and Catherine I. Alternately, some scholars have interpreted these lubki motifs as reflecting a concept of Baba Yaga as a shaman, according to which the \"crocodile\" would represent a monster who fights witches. The print would therefore be something of a \"cultural m\u00e9lange\" that \"demonstrate[s] an interest in shamanism at the time\". Contemporary to the production of the lubki, the Finnic peoples still practiced a form of shamanism.According to scholar Andreas Johns, \"Neither of these two interpretations significantly changes the image of Baba Yaga familiar from folktales. Either she can be seen as a literal evil witch, treated somewhat humorously in these prints, or as a figurative 'witch', an unpopular foreign empress. Both literal and figurative understandings of Baba Yaga are documented in the nineteenth century and were probably present at the time these prints were made.\"\n\n\n== Related figures and analogues ==\nJe\u017eibaba, a figure closely related to Baba Yaga, occurs in the folklore of the West Slavic peoples. The name Je\u017eibaba and its variants are directly related to that of Baba Yaga. The two figures may stem from a common figure as far back as the medieval period, if not further, and both figures are at times similarly ambiguous. The two differ in their occurrence in different tale types and in details regarding their appearances. Questions linger regarding the limited Slavic area\u2014East Slavic nations, Slovakia, and the Czech lands\u2014in which references to Je\u017eibaba are recorded. Another related figure appears in Polish folklore by the name of Jedza.Scholars have identified a variety of beings in folklore who share similarities of varying extent with Baba Yaga. These similarities may be due to either direct relation or cultural contact between the Eastern Slavs and other surrounding peoples. In Central and Eastern Europe, these figures include the Bulgarian gorska maika (\u0413\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0439\u043a\u0430', 'Forest Mother', also the name of a flower); the Hungarian vasorr\u00fa b\u00e1ba ('Iron-nose Midwife'), the Serbian Baba Korizma, Gvozdenzuba ('Iron-tooth'), Baba Roga (used to scare children in Bosnia, Croatia, Montenegro and Serbia), \u0161umska majka ('Forest Mother'), and the babice; and the Slovenian jaga baba or je\u017eibaba, Pehta or Pehtra baba and kvatrna baba or kvatrnica. In Romanian folklore, similarities have been identified in several figures, including Mama padurii ('Forest Mother'). In neighboring Germanic Europe, similarities have been observed between the Alpine Perchta and Holda or Holle in the folklore of Central and Northern Germany, and the Swiss Chlungeri.Some scholars have proposed that the concept of Baba Yaga was influenced by East Slavic contact with Finno-Ugric and Siberian peoples. The Karelian Sy\u00f6j\u00e4t\u00e4r has some aspects of Baba Yaga, but only the negative ones, while in other Karelian tales, helpful roles akin to those from Baba Yaga may be performed by a character called akka (Karelian for \"old woman\").\n\n\n== Modern influence ==\n\"The Hut on Fowl's Legs (Baba Yaga)\" is the title of a piece in Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition.\nShe is mentioned in the Marvel Cinematic Universe by a friend of Ant Man.\nIn 1899, the illustrator Ivan Bilibin depicted Baba Yaga in his illustrations for \"Vasilisa the Beautiful\", a Russian folktale collected in Alexander Afanasyev's Narodnye russkie skazki.\nBaba Yaga's Assistant written by Marika McCoola; illustrated by Emily Carroll.\nIn the novel Ask Baba Yaga: Otherworldly Advice for Everyday Troubles by Taisia Kitaiskaia, the character of Baba Yaga gives advice for contemporary life.\nBaba Yaga appears as a character in the book The Door By the Staircase by Katherine Marsh; illustrated by Kelly Murphy.\nIn the animated series Arthur, Baba Yaga is among the creatures of folklore that the character Sue Ellen suspects after she and her friends hear a strange noise in the woods.

B\u00e1ba-Jag\u00e1, IPA: [\u02c8bab\u0259 j\u026a\u02c8\u0261a] (listen)) is a supernatural being (or a trio of sisters of the same name) who appears as a deformed or ferocious-looking old woman. In Slavic culture, Baba Yaga lived in a hut usually described as standing on chicken legs.Baba Yaga may help or hinder those that encounter her or seek her out. She may play a maternal role and has associations with forest wildlife. According to Vladimir Propp's folktale morphology, Baba Yaga commonly appears as either a donor, villain, or may be altogether ambiguous. Her depictions vary greatly across tales, ranging from a child-eating monster, to helping a protagonist find his missing bride.\nAndreas Johns identifies Baba Yaga as \"one of the most memorable and distinctive figures in eastern European folklore\", and observes that she is \"enigmatic\" and often exhibits \"striking ambiguity\". Johns summarizes Baba Yaga as \"a many-faceted figure, capable of inspiring researchers to see her as a Cloud, Moon, Death, Winter, Snake, Bird, Pelican or Earth Goddess, totemic matriarchal ancestress, female initiator, phallic mother, or archetypal image\".\n\n"}, "Yarovit": {"links": ["Ynglism", "Blud", "Babay ", "Ba\u0161 \u010celik", "Lel and Polel", "Krsnik ", "Vila ", "Rod ", "B\u0142\u0119dnica ", "Volga Svyatoslavich", "Mila Gojsali\u0107", "Bannik", "Ovinnik", "Solar deity", "Bazhovism", "Latin", "East Slavs", "Pomerania", "Aleksander Br\u00fcckner", "Buyan", "Muslim Slavs", "Milan Toplica", "Tintilini\u0107", "Baba Marta", "Nav ", "Polish language", "Bishop", "Zduha\u0107", "Blagovery", "Alkonost", "Karze\u0142ek", "Likhoradka", "Svarog", "Sudice ", "Alyosha Popovich", "Chernava", "Mare ", "Koschei", "Sadko", "Radegast ", "Lada ", "Irene Kantakouzene", "Mikula Selyaninovich", "Deities and fairies of fate in Slavic mythology", "Svaro\u017eic", "Vyraj", "Kikimora", "Vodyanoy", "West Slavs", "\u017diva ", "German ", "Samodiva ", "Gamayun", "Bogomilism", "Rar\u00f3g", "Lech, Czech, and Rus", "Dola ", "Bukavac", "Svetovid", "Ilya Muromets", "Drekavac", "Russian traditions and superstitions", "Slavic folklore", "Zorya", "Chernobog", "Chort", "Psoglav", "Rani ", "Ivanovism", "Burislav", "Rugiewit", "Alatyr ", "\u010cuma", "Sirin", "Ved ", "Koliada ", "Wolgast", "Simargl", "Popiel", "Husein Grada\u0161\u010devi\u0107", "Christianization of the Slavs", "Nikita the Tanner", "Serbian folk astronomy", "Slavic fairies", "Veles ", "Slavic Christianity", "Devana", "Slavic creation myth", "Porewit", "Volkhv", "Kandybaism", "Dukljan", "Lukomorye", "Interpretatio graeca", "Mokosh", "Old Polish", "May ten", "Kingdom of Opona", "Christianization of Bulgaria", "Marzanna", "Kitezh", "Misizla", "Dodola", "Firebird ", "Yesha ", "St. Peter's church, Wolgast", "Native Ukrainian National Faith", "Nightingale the Robber", "Kupala", "Levashovism", "Likho", "Mat Zemlya", "God-Building", "Slavic dragon", "Jerzy Strzelczyk", "Slavic fantasy", "Christianization of Poland", "Czech language", "Ivan Kosan\u010di\u0107", "Porenut", "Ala ", "Baba Yaga", "Stribog", "Vasilisa the Beautiful", "Cikavac", "Upi\u00f3r", "Polevik", "Topielec", "Slavic paganism", "Islamization", "Bolotnik", "Roerichism", "Nocnitsa", "Book of Veles", "Bauk ", "Kresnik ", "Bogatyr", "Christianization of Moravia", "Christianisation of Kievan Rus'", "Ukrainian folklore", "Russian language", "Dvorovoi", "Belobog", "Mavka", "Hors", "Jarilo", "Hagiography", "ISBN ", "Ispolin", "Da\u017ebog", "Havelberg", "Vesna", "Prince Marko", "Stuha\u0107", "Christianization of Bohemia", "Rusalka", "Polabian Slavs", "Cornflower Wraith", "Domovoy", "Fern flower", "List of films based on Slavic mythology", "Peterburgian Vedism", "Christianization of Pomerania", "Alexander Br\u00fcckner", "Missionary", "Slavic Native Faith's calendars and holidays", "Bies", "Otto of Bamberg", "Svyatogor", "Lady Midday", "Perun", "Roman mythology", "Libu\u0161e", "Triglav ", "Black Arab ", "Niya ", "Dobrynya Nikitich", "Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv", "Aleksander Gieysztor", "Mars ", "Yarovit Motors", "Strzyga", "Ringing Cedars' Anastasianism", "Shishiga", "Christianization", "Meduza ", "Raskovnik", "Rahmans", "Shubin ", "Deities of Slavic religion", "Chervona Ruta", "Proto-Slavic", "Skrzak", "Leshy", "Maslenitsa", "Milo\u0161 Obili\u0107", "Boginki", "April fifteen", "Slavic Native Faith", "Ivan Tsarevich", "Dziwo\u017cona", "Berehynia"], "content": "Yarovit (Latin: Gerovit, Herovit, Polish: Jarowit) is a god of war worshipped by Polabian Slavs associated with fertility and agriculture. In interpretatio romana, he was compared to Roman god of war Mars. His feast probably fell on April 15 or May 10 - sowing festival. His symbol was a golden shield that was kept in his temple. Because of the identical first part of the name (jar(o)) he can be associated with the East Slavic god Yarilo, and because of the semantic similarity with Svetovit, some scholars suggest that both gods are related.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nYarovit's temple in Wolgast is mentioned in The life of Otto, apostle of Pomerania \u2013 hagiography dedicated to Otto of Bamberg, catholic Bishop and missionary whose mission was to Christianize Pomerania. When one of his clerics approached the temple, people probably thought that he wanted to burn it and started running towards him:\n... But one of them name Dietricus, who was in advance of them and had already approached the door of the temple, not knowing where ot turn, bodly entered the shrine itself and, seeing a golden shield fastened to the wall which had beed dedicated to Gerovit their god of war, [Latin: deo suo Gerovito, qui lingua Latina Mars dicitur...] and which they considered it unlawful to touch, he seized the shield and went forth to meet them. They, like ignorant peasants, thought that their god Gerovit was advancing to meet them, and retired stupefied with amazement and fell to the ground. When Dietricus perceived their folly he threw away thee shield and fled, thanking God that He had thought fit to deliver His servants out of their hands.\nOtto also encountered the cult of Yarovit in Havelberg:\n... On the very day of his arrival flags were placed around the town, which was enganged in celebrating a festival in honour of an idol called Gerovit. When the man of God perceived this, he was pricked to the heart on account of the great delusion of its people and refused to enter the walls of the town, but waited in front of the gate and, having summoned Wirikind, the ruler of the place, demanded of him why he permitted this idolatry to be practiced. He protested that the people had rebelled against their Archbishop Noribert because he had tried to subject them to hard servitude, and confessed that they could not be compelled to accept teaching from him, but were prepared to die rather than submit to such a burdensome servitude.Yarovit was also to appear to one of his followers to warn him against the mission.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe god's name consists of two parts: jar- and -vit. The first part, jar-, is interpreted as \"strong, raw, crude, young\", from Proto-Slavic *jar\u044a (cf. Old Polish jary (\"strong\"), Russian j\u00e1ryj (\"ardent\", \"violent, furious\")). Secondary interpretation of that part is \"spring\", from Proto-Slavic *jaro (cf. Czech jaro (\"spring\")). Second part -vit means \"lord, master\". So the name could mean \"Powerful, Strong Lord\" or \"Young Winner\".\n\n\n== Interpretations ==\nScholars believe that Yarovit was a solar god in addition to being a god of war. This is to be proven by a large, artistic, golden shield belonging to a god that can represent the sun. On the tombstone, which was created in early Christian times, located in the Church of St. Peter in Wolgast there carved a figure with a spear, which is considered the image of Yarovit.Scholars also believe that Yarilo is related to Svetovit. It is argued that the names of both gods mean the same: the name of Svetovit most likely comes from word sv\u0119t (\"powerful, mighty\") and -vit. The second similarity is the shield dedicated to Yarovit, which served to divination the victory during the war \u2013 the same function was performed by the white horse of Svetovit. Br\u00fcckner suggested that first the name Yarovit was created and later Rani replaced him with Svetovit, because the first two parts have same meaning.Yarovit could also be associated with fertility and agriculture (just like Roman Mars), and this may also tie him to Yarylo, whose name comes from a similar root. The curse spoken by Yarovit through the mouth of a pagan priest may indicate this:\nI am your god, I, who clothe the plains with grass and the woods with foliage, the produce of the fields and the trees, the offspring of the flocks and everything that is of use to man are in my power. I give these to my worshippers and take them from those who despise me. Tell then the inhabitants of the town of Hologost that they accept no foreign god who cannot help them, and that they suffer not to live the messengers of another religion who, I predict, will come to them.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBr\u00fcckner, Aleksander (1985).

It is also known as The Ballad of Green Wood. It tells a story about spring and renewal, portrayed with animated pieces of firewood. It is inspired by the Legend of Vesna from Slavic folklore.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nA man chops firewood in the winter and leaves the wood in the snow. One of the split pieces has a woman's face. As the snow melts, the wood pieces begin to dance. Water flows and plants sprout around them. A raven attacks and eats the piece with a woman's face. The raven's body turns into a piece of wood with a distorted carved face. Plants die and the snow returns. The raven flies into a cave and goes to sleep. The sun rises and shines into the cave. The raven awakens and sees a piece of wood that looks like a knight on horseback. The knight charges and kills the raven with its lance. The firewoods place the raven's body on a pile of twigs, from which greenery grows and covers it. The raven transforms into a piece of firewood with a woman's face, and grows green twigs of its own, as the other firewoods dance around it. Back at the original location, the man picks up the firewoods and rips off the green twigs before he goes inside. Smoke comes out of his chimney.\n\n\n== Themes ==\nThe film celebrates the cyclical renewal of life in the spring. According to Barta, humans are always subject to the flow of the natural world. His own ambition, which is reflected in the film, is to be attentive to nature and follow its rhythm. The film scholar Adam Whybray describes the film as a series of movements between anthropocentric rational time and the natural world's natural or traditional time. Natural time becomes ecstatic in the spring, is frozen during the winter, and then renewed the next spring. Jenny Jediny of Not Coming to a Theater Near You writes that the \"fondness for the ancient and mythological\" foreshadows Barta's 1986 film The Pied Piper\".\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe story is based on a folk tale about the Sun Prince and the virgin Vesna. The film was originally conceived in the 1970s and was to be directed by Franti\u0161ek Vl\u00e1\u010dil, but due to other commitments Vl\u00e1\u010dil abandoned it. Barta revived the project and changed its artistic direction.The film was shot in the Bohemian Forest, the High Tatras, the Kon\u011bprusy Caves and at Studio Ji\u0159\u00edho Trnky in Prague. Barta chose to make it outdoors because he was determined that a film about nature should depict real nature. This proved demanding due to the heavy reliance on stop-motion puppet animation, performed by the animator Milan  Svato\u0161, and the impact of the weather. Clouds and the sun's position created strict time limits, wind would blow over the meticulously positioned puppets, and rain caused halts in the production. The depiction of thaw was achieved by pouring water over a snowpack for several hours. The musical score was composed by Vladim\u00edr Merta.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nReviewing the DVD Jiri Barta: Labyrinth of Darkness in 2006, Jamie S. Rich of DVD Talk described the film as \"more visually stunning than illuminating, but cool all the same\". He wrote that the video quality was poor; \"probably the worst looking of the set\"; and the audio \"mixed a little low, as well\". In Animation: A World History (2016), the scholars Giannalberto Bendazzi and Tommaso Iannini call it \"a simple, short film of great impact\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of films based on Slavic mythology\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nA Ballad About Green Wood at IMDb\nCatalogue entry at Kr\u00e1tk\u00fd film Praha", "images": [], "summary": "A Ballad About Green Wood (Czech: Balada o zelen\u00e9m d\u0159evu) is a 1983 Czechoslovak short film written and directed by Ji\u0159\u00ed Barta.
