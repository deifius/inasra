In interpretatio romana, he was compared to Roman god of war Mars. His feast probably fell on April 15 or May 10 - sowing festival. His symbol was a golden shield that was kept in his temple. Because of the identical first part of the name (jar(o)) he can be associated with the East Slavic god Yarilo, and because of the semantic similarity with Svetovit, some scholars suggest that both gods are related.\n\n\n== Sources ==\nYarovit's temple in Wolgast is mentioned in The life of Otto, apostle of Pomerania \u2013 hagiography dedicated to Otto of Bamberg, catholic Bishop and missionary whose mission was to Christianize Pomerania. When one of his clerics approached the temple, people probably thought that he wanted to burn it and started running towards him:\n... But one of them name Dietricus, who was in advance of them and had already approached the door of the temple, not knowing where ot turn, bodly entered the shrine itself and, seeing a golden shield fastened to the wall which had beed dedicated to Gerovit their god of war, [Latin: deo suo Gerovito, qui lingua Latina Mars dicitur...] and which they considered it unlawful to touch, he seized the shield and went forth to meet them. They, like ignorant peasants, thought that their god Gerovit was advancing to meet them, and retired stupefied with amazement and fell to the ground. When Dietricus perceived their folly he threw away thee shield and fled, thanking God that He had thought fit to deliver His servants out of their hands.\nOtto also encountered the cult of Yarovit in Havelberg:\n... On the very day of his arrival flags were placed around the town, which was enganged in celebrating a festival in honour of an idol called Gerovit. When the man of God perceived this, he was pricked to the heart on account of the great delusion of its people and refused to enter the walls of the town, but waited in front of the gate and, having summoned Wirikind, the ruler of the place, demanded of him why he permitted this idolatry to be practiced. He protested that the people had rebelled against their Archbishop Noribert because he had tried to subject them to hard servitude, and confessed that they could not be compelled to accept teaching from him, but were prepared to die rather than submit to such a burdensome servitude.Yarovit was also to appear to one of his followers to warn him against the mission.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe god's name consists of two parts: jar- and -vit. The first part, jar-, is interpreted as \"strong, raw, crude, young\", from Proto-Slavic *jar\u044a (cf. Old Polish jary (\"strong\"), Russian j\u00e1ryj (\"ardent\", \"violent, furious\")). Secondary interpretation of that part is \"spring\", from Proto-Slavic *jaro (cf. Czech jaro (\"spring\")). Second part -vit means \"lord, master\". So the name could mean \"Powerful, Strong Lord\" or \"Young Winner\".\n\n\n== Interpretations ==\nScholars believe that Yarovit was a solar god in addition to being a god of war. This is to be proven by a large, artistic, golden shield belonging to a god that can represent the sun. On the tombstone, which was created in early Christian times, located in the Church of St. Peter in Wolgast there carved a figure with a spear, which is considered the image of Yarovit.Scholars also believe that Yarilo is related to Svetovit. It is argued that the names of both gods mean the same: the name of Svetovit most likely comes from word sv\u0119t (\"powerful, mighty\") and -vit. The second similarity is the shield dedicated to Yarovit, which served to divination the victory during the war \u2013 the same function was performed by the white horse of Svetovit. Br\u00fcckner suggested that first the name Yarovit was created and later Rani replaced him with Svetovit, because the first two parts have same meaning.Yarovit could also be associated with fertility and agriculture (just like Roman Mars), and this may also tie him to Yarylo, whose name comes from a similar root. The curse spoken by Yarovit through the mouth of a pagan priest may indicate this:\nI am your god, I, who clothe the plains with grass and the woods with foliage, the produce of the fields and the trees, the offspring of the flocks and everything that is of use to man are in my power. I give these to my worshippers and take them from those who despise me. Tell then the inhabitants of the town of Hologost that they accept no foreign god who cannot help them, and that they suffer not to live the messengers of another religion who, I predict, will come to them.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nBr\u00fcckner, Aleksander (1985).

It is also known as The Ballad of Green Wood. It tells a story about spring and renewal, portrayed with animated pieces of firewood. It is inspired by the Legend of Vesna from Slavic folklore.\n\n\n== Plot ==\nA man chops firewood in the winter and leaves the wood in the snow. One of the split pieces has a woman's face. As the snow melts, the wood pieces begin to dance. Water flows and plants sprout around them. A raven attacks and eats the piece with a woman's face. The raven's body turns into a piece of wood with a distorted carved face. Plants die and the snow returns. The raven flies into a cave and goes to sleep. The sun rises and shines into the cave. The raven awakens and sees a piece of wood that looks like a knight on horseback. The knight charges and kills the raven with its lance. The firewoods place the raven's body on a pile of twigs, from which greenery grows and covers it. The raven transforms into a piece of firewood with a woman's face, and grows green twigs of its own, as the other firewoods dance around it. Back at the original location, the man picks up the firewoods and rips off the green twigs before he goes inside. Smoke comes out of his chimney.\n\n\n== Themes ==\nThe film celebrates the cyclical renewal of life in the spring. According to Barta, humans are always subject to the flow of the natural world. His own ambition, which is reflected in the film, is to be attentive to nature and follow its rhythm. The film scholar Adam Whybray describes the film as a series of movements between anthropocentric rational time and the natural world's natural or traditional time. Natural time becomes ecstatic in the spring, is frozen during the winter, and then renewed the next spring. Jenny Jediny of Not Coming to a Theater Near You writes that the \"fondness for the ancient and mythological\" foreshadows Barta's 1986 film The Pied Piper\".\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe story is based on a folk tale about the Sun Prince and the virgin Vesna. The film was originally conceived in the 1970s and was to be directed by Franti\u0161ek Vl\u00e1\u010dil, but due to other commitments Vl\u00e1\u010dil abandoned it. Barta revived the project and changed its artistic direction.The film was shot in the Bohemian Forest, the High Tatras, the Kon\u011bprusy Caves and at Studio Ji\u0159\u00edho Trnky in Prague. Barta chose to make it outdoors because he was determined that a film about nature should depict real nature. This proved demanding due to the heavy reliance on stop-motion puppet animation, performed by the animator Milan  Svato\u0161, and the impact of the weather. Clouds and the sun's position created strict time limits, wind would blow over the meticulously positioned puppets, and rain caused halts in the production. The depiction of thaw was achieved by pouring water over a snowpack for several hours. The musical score was composed by Vladim\u00edr Merta.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nReviewing the DVD Jiri Barta: Labyrinth of Darkness in 2006, Jamie S. Rich of DVD Talk described the film as \"more visually stunning than illuminating, but cool all the same\". He wrote that the video quality was poor; \"probably the worst looking of the set\"; and the audio \"mixed a little low, as well\". In Animation: A World History (2016), the scholars Giannalberto Bendazzi and Tommaso Iannini call it \"a simple, short film of great impact\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of films based on Slavic mythology\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nA Ballad About Green Wood at IMDb\nCatalogue entry at Kr\u00e1tk\u00fd film Praha", "images": [], "summary": "A Ballad About Green Wood (Czech: Balada o zelen\u00e9m d\u0159evu) is a 1983 Czechoslovak short film written and directed by Ji\u0159\u00ed Barta.
