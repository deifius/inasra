"Vesna (Cyrillic: \u0412\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0430) was a mythological female character associated with youth and springtime in early Slavic mythology, particularly within Croatia, Serbia, North Macedonia and Slovenia. Along with her male companion Vesnik, she was associated with rituals conducted in rural areas during springtime. In the nineteenth century, Russian peasants celebrated the return of spring on March 1 by going out to the fields, carrying a clay figure of a lark on a pivot which had been decorated with flowers. They sang songs naming the spring season Vesna.  \nThe word \"vesna\" is still the poetic word for \"spring\" in the Slovene language, as well as Czech and Slovak. In Russian, Polish, Ukrainian and Belarusian languages vesna/wiosna is the actual word for spring. The month February is sometimes named vesnar in Slovene language. In Serbian, the word vesnik is used to denote someone who heralds or brings about springtime. \n\n"
