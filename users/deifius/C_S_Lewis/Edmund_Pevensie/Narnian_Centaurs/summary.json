"In the Chronicles of Narnia franchise created by C. S. Lewis, Narnian Centaurs are creatures with the upper torso of a human and the lower legs and body of a horse, just as they appear in Greek mythology. Unlike most of their counterparts in the Greek myths (which are portrayed as wild, violent, lustful, and intoxicated), Narnian centaurs are always seen in a positive light, more in line with the unique Greek figure Chiron. Throughout the books, they are seen as wise prophets, sages, and loyal courtiers. Typically, they are highly skilled in astronomy and divination, using this ability to read the stars and tell of future events. In addition, they are usually proficient warriors, using their great size and strength to their advantage. Centaurs are viewed as one of the most majestic and powerful creatures in Narnia, and as such, fellow Narnians place a great deal of respect on any member of this species.\nCentaurs appear in five out of seven books in the Chronicles of Narnia series, two out of three of the movie adaptations, and the other assorted television specials and series based on the works of C. S. Lewis.\n\n"
