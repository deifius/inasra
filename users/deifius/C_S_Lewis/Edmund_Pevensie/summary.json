"Edmund \"Ed\" Pevensie is a fictional character in C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia series. He is a principal character in three of the seven books (The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Prince Caspian, and The Voyage of the Dawn Treader), and a lesser character in two others (The Horse and His Boy and The Last Battle).\nIn the live-action films, The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe, Prince Caspian and  The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, Edmund is portrayed by actor Skandar Keynes. Actor Mark Wells portrays an older Edmund at the end of the first film.\nIn The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Edmund betrays his siblings to the White Witch while under her influence, but as the story goes on, he accepts the error of his ways. He is redeemed with the intervention of Aslan and joins the fight against the witch. Fulfilling an ancient prophecy, he becomes King Edmund the Just, King of Narnia, and with sisters Susan and Lucy, co-ruler under High King Peter. Edmund is described in one book in a scene in Tashbaan as being part of a group of men 'as fair-skinned as [Shasta], and most of them had fair hair', although whether Edmund is one of the fair-haired ones is not clear. In the illustrations of him in the final book he is drawn as having fair hair.\n\n"
