Fire was associated with a living being--it ate, breathed, grew, decayed, and died--in both Western and non-Western religions. Fire was so basic to the human experience that it persisted in the minds of humanity as an element close to nature.Fire rituals in Mesopotamia and Eurasia were thought to originate with Ancient Zoroastrian rituals around the use of fire in temples and on altars. Ancient Zoroastrians believe fire to have been \u201cthe most holy spirit\u201d from which all life was born, and was used as a central icon in many rituals.In the Old Testament, fire was often associated with divine intervention; with the burning bush guiding the decision of Moses, and the pillar of fire guiding the Israelites in the wilderness. Even the burning of Sodom and Gomorrah was accomplished through divine retribution.Greek legends of the origins of fire speaks to the importance of fire to separate humans from animals. To many Ancient Greeks, fire was a godly element bestowed by higher forces; given to humanity by the Titan Prometheus. It is said that in Greek society, virgins at the Temple of Athena in Athens regularly practiced pyromancy. It is also likely the followers of Hephaestus, the Greek god of fire and the forge, practiced pyromancy.In Renaissance magic, pyromancy was classified as one of the seven \"forbidden arts,\" along with necromancy, geomancy, aeromancy, hydromancy, chiromancy (palmistry), and scapulimancy.Fire rituals in East Asia most often revolved around animal bones. In Ancient China, Japan, and Tibet, bones from animal scapula (the shoulder bone) would be thrown into fires, and the cracks would be interpreted to divine the future. In Japan, specifically, turtle shells would also be used as a ritualistic divination technique. In Tibet such divination was used to understand natural phenomena otherwise inexplicable to villagers. Lamps using animal fat were often burned by ancient Tibetan peoples, and the smoke and flames were interpreted as the guidance of natural forces.\n\n\n== Types of pyromancy ==\nThe most basic form of pyromancy is that in which the diviner observes flames, from a sacrificial fire, a candle, or another source of flame, and interprets the shapes that he or she sees within them.  There are several variations on pyromancy, however, some of which are as follows:\n\nAlomancy, divination by salt, one type of which involves casting salt into a fire\nBotanomancy, divination by burning plants\nCapnomancy, divination by smoke; light, thin smoke that rose straight up was a good omen; otherwise, a bad one.\nCausinomancy, divination by burning (non-specific as to the object burned)\nDaphnomancy (also, Empyromancy), divination by burning laurel leaves\nOsteomancy, divination using bones, one type of which involves heating to produce cracks\nPlastromancy, divination using turtle plastrons; in China, this was done by heating pits carved into them.\nScapulimancy, divination by scapulae; in Asia and North America, this was done pyromantically.\nSideromancy, divination by burning straw with an iron.\n\n\n== References ==", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/9/99/20201004174738%21Question_book-new.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/9/99/20171208221057%21Question_book-new.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/9/99/20171207131032%21Question_book-new.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/9/99/20160612140736%21Question_book-new.svg"], "summary": "Pyromancy (from Greek pyr, \u201cfire,\u201d and manteia, \u201cdivination\u201d) is the art of divination by means of fire."}, "Necromancy": {"links": ["Anito", "General Zod", "Homer", "Koine Greek", "Alchemy", "Newes from Scotland", "Weird fiction", "Ancient Rome", "Molybdomancy", "Kevin Siembieda", "Babylonia", "Fairytales", "Taxidermy", "Occult detective fiction", "Necron ", "Coffin birth", "Archaeology of religion and ritual", "Natural burial", "List of Yu-Gi-Oh! fiveD's characters", "Shamanism", "Robert Ranulph Marett", "Excarnation", "Favomancy", "Karoshi", "Newcastle Forgotten Fantasy Library", "Hecate", "Paraptosis", "Daemonologie", "Apophenia", "Richard Kieckhefer", "Mythopoeic Society", "Contemporary fantasy", "Geomancy", "Oxford University Press", "Death knell", "Ouija", "Rune", "Giant", "Augur", "Rush ", "John of Salisbury", "Fairy tale parody", "Hard fantasy", "Edward Kelley", "Tokusatsu", "Mary Douglas", "Apparent death", "Broom", "Myth and ritual", "Oni", "Rite of passage", "Death messenger", "If\u00e1", "Samuel Butler ", "Suicide gene", "Shade ", "Livor mortis", "Totem", "Aradia", "English Pronouncing Dictionary", "Tolkien fandom", "Caveman", "Early history of fantasy", "Edward Burnett Tylor", "Hasidic Judaism", "Extinction", "Hindu denominations", "Maleficium ", "Near-death experience", "Parthanatos", "Roy Rappaport", "Canaan", "Chinese folk religion", "Benandanti", "Clinical death", "Joseph Addison", "Oracle", "Firestarter ", "Witchcraft in Latin America", "Medical definition of death", "Korean shamanism", "Sacred\u2013profane dichotomy", "GND ", "Myrmomancy", "Dismemberment", "Ceremonial pole", "Ailuromancy", "Goetia", "Suspicious death", "Museum of Death", "Sword-and-sandal", "Black shamanism", "Chinese numismatic charm", "The True Game", "Non-denominational Muslim", "List of fantasy comics", "Noaidi", "Unknown ", "LGBT themes in speculative fiction", "Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria", "Book of Deuteronomy", "Tasseography", "Anthropological Perspectives on Religion", "Odyssey", "Dieselpunk", "Hobgoblin", "Sword-and-sorcery", "Ahmadiyya", "Witchcraft", "Kalku", "Enchanted forest", "List of stock characters", "Makutu", "Lutheranism", "Ritual", "Dalhousie University", "Sacred language", "Outline of death", "Horror fiction", "Orthodox Judaism", "The Folklore Society", "Magical Investigations", "Palladium Books", "Anthony F.

Sometimes referred to as \"Death Magic\", the term may also sometimes be used in a more general sense to refer to black magic or witchcraft.The word necromancy is adapted from Late Latin necromantia, itself borrowed from post-Classical Greek \u03bd\u03b5\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 (nekromante\u00eda), a compound of Ancient Greek \u03bd\u03b5\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 (nekr\u00f3s), \"dead body\", and \u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 (mante\u00eda), \"divination by means of\"; this compound form was first used by Origen of Alexandria in the 3rd century AD. The Classical Greek term was \u1f21 \u03bd\u03ad\u03ba\u03c5\u03b9\u03b1 (nekyia), from the episode of the Odyssey in which Odysseus visits the realm of the dead souls and \u03bd\u03b5\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 in Hellenistic Greek, rendered as necromant\u012ba in Latin, and as necromancy in 17th-century English.\n\n\n== Antiquity ==\n\nEarly necromancy was related to \u2013 and most likely evolved from \u2013 shamanism, which calls upon spirits such as the ghosts of ancestors. Classical necromancers addressed the dead in \"a mixture of high-pitch squeaking and low droning\", comparable to the trance-state mutterings of shamans.\nNecromancy was prevalent throughout antiquity with records of its practice in ancient Egypt, Babylonia, Greece and Rome. In his Geographica, Strabo refers to \u03bd\u03b5\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 (nekromantia), or \"diviners by the dead\", as the foremost practitioners of divination among the people of Persia, and it is believed to have also been widespread among the peoples of Chaldea (particularly the Sabians, or \"star-worshipers\"), Etruria and Babylonia. The Babylonian necromancers were called manzazuu or sha'etemmu, and the spirits they raised were called etemmu.\nThe oldest literary account of necromancy is found in Homer's Odyssey. Under the direction of Circe, a powerful sorceress, Odysseus travels to the underworld (katabasis) in order to gain insight about his impending voyage home by raising the spirits of the dead through the use of spells which Circe has taught him. He wishes to invoke and question the shade of Tiresias in particular; however, he is unable to summon the seer's spirit without the assistance of others. The Odyssey's passages contain many descriptive references to necromantic rituals: rites must be performed around a pit with fire during nocturnal hours, and Odysseus has to follow a specific recipe, which includes the blood of sacrificial animals, to concoct a libation for the ghosts to drink while he recites prayers to both the ghosts and gods of the underworld.Practices such as these, varying from the mundane to the grotesque, were commonly associated with necromancy. Rituals could be quite elaborate, involving magic circles, wands, talismans, and incantations. The necromancer might also surround himself with morbid aspects of death, which often included wearing the deceased's clothing and consuming foods that symbolized lifelessness and decay such as unleavened black bread and unfermented grape juice. Some necromancers even went so far as to take part in the mutilation and consumption of corpses. These ceremonies could carry on for hours, days, or even weeks, leading up to the eventual summoning of spirits. Frequently they were performed in places of interment or other melancholy venues that suited specific guidelines of the necromancer. Additionally, necromancers preferred to summon the recently departed based on the premise that their revelations were spoken more clearly. This timeframe was usually limited to the twelve months following the death of the physical body; once this period elapsed, necromancers would evoke the deceased's ghostly spirit instead.While some cultures considered the knowledge of the dead to be unlimited, ancient Greeks and Romans believed that individual shades knew only certain things. The apparent value of their counsel may have been based on things they knew in life or knowledge they acquired after death. Ovid writes in his Metamorphoses of a marketplace in the underworld where the dead convene to exchange news and gossip.\nThere are also several references to necromancers \u2013 called \"bone-conjurers\" among Jews of the later Hellenistic period \u2013 in the Bible. The Book of Deuteronomy (18:9\u201312) explicitly warns the Israelites against engaging in the Canaanite practice of divination from the dead: 9When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do according to the abominations of those nations. 10There shall not be found among you any one who maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or who useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a witch, 11or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer. 12For all who do these things are an abomination unto the LORD, and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee (KJV). Though Mosaic Law prescribed the death penalty to practitioners of necromancy (Leviticus 20:27), this warning was not always heeded. One of the foremost examples is when King Saul had the Witch of Endor invoke the spirit of Samuel, a judge and prophet, from Sheol using a ritual conjuring pit (1 Samuel 28:3\u201325).  However, the so-called witch was shocked at the presence of the real spirit of Samuel for in I Sam 28:12 it says, \"when the woman saw Samuel, she cried out in a loud voice.\" Samuel questioned his reawakening asking, \"Why hast thou disquieted me?\"  Saul did not receive a death penalty (his being the highest authority in the land) but he did receive it from God himself as prophesied by Samuel during that conjuration \u2013 within a day he died in battle along with his son Jonathan.\nSome Christian writers later rejected the idea that humans could bring back the spirits of the dead and interpreted such shades as disguised demons instead, thus conflating necromancy with demon summoning. Caesarius of Arles entreats his audience to put no stock in any demons or gods other than the Christian God, even if the working of spells appears to provide benefit. He states that demons only act with divine permission and are permitted by God to test Christian people. Caesarius does not condemn man here; he only states that the art of necromancy exists, although it is prohibited by the Bible.\n\n\n== Early and High Middle Age ==\nMany medieval writers believed that actual resurrection required the assistance of God. They saw the practice of necromancy as conjuring demons who took the appearance of spirits. The practice became known explicitly as maleficium, and the Catholic Church condemned it. Though the practitioners of necromancy were linked by many common threads, there is no evidence that these necromancers ever organized as a group. One noted commonality among practitioners of necromancy was usually the utilization of certain toxic and hallucinogenic plants from the nightshade family such as black henbane, jimson weed, belladonna or mandrake, usually in magic salves or potions.Medieval necromancy is believed to be a synthesis of astral magic derived from Arabic influences and exorcism derived from Christian and Jewish teachings. Arabic influences are evident in rituals that involve moon phases, sun placement, day and time. Fumigation and the act of burying images are also found in both astral magic and necromancy. Christian and Jewish influences appear in the symbols and in the conjuration formulas used in summoning rituals.Practitioners were often members of the Christian clergy, though some nonclerical practitioners are recorded. In some instances, mere apprentices or those ordained to lower orders dabbled in the practice. They were connected by a belief in the manipulation of spiritual beings \u2013 especially demons \u2013 and magical practices. These practitioners were almost always literate and well educated. Most possessed basic knowledge of exorcism and had access to texts of astrology and of demonology. Clerical training was informal and university-based education rare. Most were trained under apprenticeships and were expected to have a basic knowledge of Latin, ritual and doctrine. This education was not always linked to spiritual guidance and seminaries were almost non-existent. This situation allowed some aspiring clerics to combine Christian rites with occult practices despite its condemnation in Christian doctrine.Medieval practitioners believed they could accomplish three things with necromancy: will manipulation, illusions, and knowledge:\n\nWill manipulation affects the mind and will of another person, animal, or spirit. Demons are summoned to cause various afflictions on others, \"to drive them mad, to inflame them to love or hatred, to gain their favor, or to constrain them to do or not do some deed.\"\nIllusions involve reanimation of the dead or conjuring food, entertainment, or a mode of transportation.\nKnowledge is allegedly discovered when demons provide information about various things. This might involve identifying criminals, finding items, or revealing future events.The act of performing medieval necromancy usually involved magic circles, conjurations, and sacrifices such as those shown in the Munich Manual of Demonic Magic:\n\nCircles were usually traced on the ground, though cloth and parchment were sometimes used. Various objects, shapes, symbols, and letters may be drawn or placed within that represent a mixture of Christian and occult ideas. Circles were believed to empower and protect what was contained within, including protecting the necromancer from the conjured demons.\nConjuration is the method of communicating with the demons to have them enter the physical world. It usually employs the power of special words and stances to call out the demons and often incorporated the use of Christian prayers or biblical verses. These conjurations may be repeated in succession or repeated to different directions until the summoning is complete.\nSacrifice was the payment for summoning; though it may involve the flesh of a human being or animal, it could sometimes be as simple as offering a certain object. Instructions for obtaining these items were usually specific. The time, location, and method of gathering items for sacrifice could also play an important role in the ritual.The rare confessions of those accused of necromancy suggest that there was a range of spell casting and related magical experimentation. It is difficult to determine if these details were due to their practices, as opposed to the whims of their interrogators. John of Salisbury is one of the first examples related by Richard Kieckhefer, but as a Parisian ecclesiastical court record of 1323 shows, a \"group who were plotting to invoke the demon Berich from inside a circle made from strips of cat skin\" were obviously participating in what the Church would define as \"necromancy\".Herbert Stanley Redgrove claims necromancy as one of three chief branches of medieval ceremonial magic, alongside black magic and white magic. This does not correspond to contemporary classifications, which often conflate \"nigromancy\" (\"black-knowledge\") with \"necromancy\" (\"death-knowledge\").\n\n\n== Late Middle Ages to Renaissance ==\n\nIn the wake of inconsistencies of judgment, necromancers and other practitioners of the magic arts were able to utilize spells featuring holy names with impunity, as any biblical references in such rituals could be construed as prayers rather than spells. As a consequence, the necromancy that appears in the Munich Manual is an evolution of these theoretical understandings. It has been suggested that the authors of the Manual knowingly designed the book to be in discord with ecclesiastical law. The main recipe employed throughout the Manual used the same religious language and names of power alongside demonic names. An understanding of the names of God derived from apocryphal texts and the Hebrew Torah required that the author of such rites have at least a casual familiarity with these sources.\nWithin the tales related in occult manuals are found connections with stories from other cultures' literary traditions. For instance, the ceremony for conjuring a horse closely relates to the Arabic One Thousand and One Nights and French romances; Chaucer's The Squire's Tale also bears marked similarities. This becomes a parallel evolution of spells to foreign gods or demons that were once acceptable, and frames them into a new Christian context, albeit demonic and forbidden. As the material for these manuals was apparently derived from scholarly magical and religious texts from a variety of sources in many languages, the scholars who studied these texts likely manufactured their own aggregate sourcebook and manual with which to work spells or magic.\nIn the notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, it is stated that \"Of all human opinions that is to be reputed the most foolish which deals with the belief in Necromancy, the sister of Alchemy, which gives birth to simple and natural things.\"\n\n\n== Modern era ==\nIn the present day, necromancy is more generally used as a term to describe manipulation of death and the dead, or the pretense thereof, often facilitated through the use of ritual magic or some other kind of occult ceremony. Contemporary s\u00e9ances, channeling and Spiritualism verge on necromancy when supposedly invoked spirits are asked to reveal future events or secret information. Necromancy may also be presented as sciomancy, a branch of theurgic magic.\nBecause of their themes of spirit contact, the long-running show Supernatural Chicago and the annual Harry Houdini s\u00e9ance, both of which are held at the Excalibur nightclub in Chicago, Illinois, dub their lead performer \"Neil Tobin, Necromancer\".\nAs to the practice of necromancy having endured in one form or another throughout the millennia, An Encyclop\u00e6dia of Occultism states: The art is of almost universal usage. Considerable difference of opinion exists among modern adepts as to the exact methods to be properly pursued in the necromantic art, and it must be borne in mind that necromancy, which in the Middle Ages was called sorcery, shades into modern spiritualistic practice. There is no doubt, however, that necromancy is the touch-stone of occultism, for if, after careful preparation the adept can carry through to a successful issue, the raising of the soul from the other world, he has proved the value of his art.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nNecromancy appears in many works of fantasy fiction, often by villains who use it to raise armies of zombies that the heroes must slay.\n\n\"The Necromancer\" by the Canadian rock group Rush from their 1975 album \"Caress of Steel\"Necromancy is a popular plot element in computer and video game franchise series, such as Bioshock, Borderlands, Diablo, The Elder Scrolls, Warcraft, Magic the Gathering, Gothic and Mortal Kombat, as well as in the tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons.\nThe Dark Lord Sauron adopts a guise known as the Necromancer in the 1937 novel The Hobbit.\nIn the film Army of Darkness (1992) the protagonist Ash fights a skeletal army raised by the Necronomicon.\nWarhammer 40,000, The Mummy Returns, Yu-Gi-Oh! GX and Man of Steel feature antagonists who are trying to revive their own people that have been dead for a long time, specifically Necrons, Anubis, Camula and General Zod, respectively.\nNecromancer is the main protagonist of Tony Vilgotsky's novel Shepherd of the Dead.\nNecromancer was the title of a song on the Al Stewart 1993 album Famous Last Words (Al Stewart album); the name comes from the song's lyric, \"oh, the necromancer inside us all!\", with further lyrics referencing commonly associated themes of black magic and the supernatural.\nNecromancer was the title of a song on the Van der Graaf Generator 1969 album The Aerosol Grey Machine, in which the lyrics describe an unnamed, benevolent necromancer.\nNecromancy Cottage, or, the Black Art of Gnawing on Bones, a literary fantasy novel written by Rebecca Maye Holiday during her dual studies of law and occult magic at Dalhousie University and University of King's College, followed a necromancer, Desmond Trauer, and his unwilling apprentice, Holly Nemov, who are both made to question the intent of their magic when an outsider visits their secluded island. Holly, an indentured boy and a sea demon, betrays Desmond and has his apprenticeship disavowed.\nFirestarter (novel) by horror author Stephen King featured Necromancer as the name of a horse that main character Charlie McGee enjoys riding during her time spent trapped at a secret government agency. In the 1984 adaptation of Firestarter (film), antagonist John Rainbird explains to Charlie that a necromancer is \"some kind of a wizard\".\nIn the band Sundara Karma's second album \u201cUfilitas\u2019 Alphabet\u201d there is a song entitled \u201cDuller Days\u201d which includes the line \u201cA Necromance as common as the flu\u201d.\nIn the 2018 horror comedy anime Zombie Land Saga, idol producer and supporting character named Kotaro Tatsumi (who happens to be a necromancer) resurrected six \"legendary\" girls, including the main protagonist Sakura Minamoto, to form an all-zombie idol group known as \"Franchouchou\" in order to help revitalize Saga Prefecture.\nIn Sheri S. Tepper's True Game series, necromancy is one of the primary Talents that may be possessed by Gamesmen.\nIn the A Certain Magical Index spinoff manga A Certain Scientific Accelerator, the character Esther Rosenthal belongs to a line of necromancers, in which she is the current head.\nIn the MMORPG Wizard101 the term necromancer is used for a character that practices death school magic.\nIn Ridley Scott's Raised by Wolves series, the underlying type of android for a certain character in the show.\nThe Sorceress from the 2013 fantasy beat-em-up Dragon's Crown is a necromancer who can reanimate skeletons found in dungeons to fight as her ally.\nThe film Mythica: A Quest for Heroes and its sequels has the protagonist Marek, a young woman capable of doing necromancy (here an ability to control the dead, plus drain people's life force) along with the villain. Here it is not portrayed as inherently evil, but an addictive, corrupting practicing which Marek must struggle with.\n\"The Bone Witch\", a young adult fantasy novel by author Rin Chupeco, follows a girl named Tea whose necromantic magic is scorned; the book was marketed largely using a line from the text regarding a scene where Tea uses necromancy to resurrect her deceased brother.\nPet Sematary by Stephen King explores the story of Louis Creed, a doctor whose elderly neighbor shows him how to use an old Mi'kmaq burial ground to resurrect dead animals, and eventually people. This miracle turns out to be more of a curse, as everything resurrected from the burial ground becomes violent and sadistic.\nAn episode of Ghost Stories (Japanese TV series) titled \"The Corpse That Roams in the Night - Shirotabi\" features an eccentric young schoolgirl with an affinity for animals, who unexpectedly uses supernatural forces to resurrect a pet rabbit from the dead, which emerges as a violent monster. The infamous tongue-in-cheek English dub of the anime series largely followed the same plot, but to more comedic ends.\n\"The Necromancer's Apprentice\" by R.M. Prioleau was a small horror novella originally written as an attempt for National Novel Writing Month and later self-published. While receiving poor reviews, the novella, which follows a girl called Jasmine who becomes an apprentice to a necromancer after her parents die, generated a following with readers online.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGastromancy\nGr\u00f3galdr\nHaitian Vodou\nList of occult terms\nMacumba\nMagick (Thelema)\nNecromanteion of Acheron\nOuija\nS\u00e9ance\nSpirit possession\nWitchcraft and divination in the Hebrew Bible\nY\u016brei\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nCook, D.

Sometimes referred to as \"Death Magic\", the term may also sometimes be used in a more general sense to refer to black magic or witchcraft.The word necromancy is adapted from Late Latin necromantia, itself borrowed from post-Classical Greek \u03bd\u03b5\u03ba\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 (nekromante\u00eda), a compound of Ancient Greek \u03bd\u03b5\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 (nekr\u00f3s), \"dead body\", and \u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 (mante\u00eda), \"divination by means of\"; this compound form was first used by Origen of Alexandria in the 3rd century AD.

In the early modern era, he was regarded as a wizard and particularly famed for the story of his mechanical or necromantic brazen head. He is sometimes credited (mainly since the 19th century) as one of the earliest European advocates of the modern scientific method. Bacon applied the empirical method of Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) to observations in texts attributed to Aristotle. Bacon discovered the importance of empirical testing when the results he obtained were different from those that would have been predicted by Aristotle.His linguistic work has been heralded for its early exposition of a universal grammar. 21st century re-evaluations emphasise that Bacon was essentially a medieval thinker, with much of his \"experimental\" knowledge obtained from books in the scholastic tradition. He was, however, partially responsible for a revision of the medieval university curriculum, which saw the addition of optics to the traditional quadrivium.Bacon's major work, the Opus Majus, was sent to Pope Clement IV in Rome in 1267 upon the pope's request. Although gunpowder was first invented and described in China, Bacon was the first in Europe to record its formula.\n\n\n== Life ==\n\nRoger Bacon was born in Ilchester in Somerset, England, in the early 13th century, although his date of birth is sometimes narrowed down to c.\u20091210, \"1213 or 1214\", or \"1215\". However, modern scholars tend to argue for the date of c.\u20091220, but there are disagreements on this. The only source for his birth date is a statement from his 1267 Opus Tertium that \"forty years have passed since I first learned the Alphabetum\". The latest dates assume this referred to the alphabet itself, but elsewhere in the Opus Tertium it is clear that Bacon uses the term to refer to rudimentary studies, the trivium or quadrivium that formed the medieval curriculum. His family appears to have been well off.Bacon studied at Oxford. While Robert Grosseteste had probably left shortly before Bacon's arrival, his work and legacy almost certainly influenced the young scholar and it is possible Bacon subsequently visited him and William of Sherwood in Lincoln. Bacon became a master at Oxford, lecturing on Aristotle. There is no evidence he was ever awarded a doctorate. (The title Doctor Mirabilis was a posthumous scholastic accolade.) A caustic cleric named Roger Bacon is recorded speaking before the king at Oxford in 1233.\n\nIn 1237 or at some point in the following decade, he accepted an invitation to teach at the University of Paris. While there, he lectured on Latin grammar, Aristotelian logic, arithmetic, geometry, and the mathematical aspects of astronomy and music. His faculty colleagues included Robert Kilwardby, Albertus Magnus, and Peter of Spain, the future Pope John XXI. The Cornishman Richard Rufus was a scholarly opponent. In 1247 or soon after, he left his position in Paris.\n\nAs a private scholar, his whereabouts for the next decade are uncertain but he was likely in Oxford c.\u20091248\u20131251, where he met Adam Marsh, and in Paris in 1251. He seems to have studied most of the known Greek and Arabic works on optics (then known as \"perspective\", perspectiva). A passage in the Opus Tertium states that at some point he took a two-year break from his studies.By the late 1250s, resentment against the king's preferential treatment of his \u00e9migr\u00e9 Poitevin relatives led to a coup and the imposition of the Provisions of Oxford and Westminster, instituting a baronial council and more frequent parliaments. Pope Urban IV absolved the king of his oath in 1261 and, after initial abortive resistance, Simon de Montfort led a force, enlarged due to recent crop failures, that prosecuted the Second Barons' War. Bacon's own family were considered royal partisans: De Montfort's men seized their property and drove several members into exile.\n\nIn 1256 or 1257, he became a friar in the Franciscan Order in either Paris or Oxford, following the example of scholarly English Franciscans such as Grosseteste and Marsh. After 1260, Bacon's activities were restricted by a statute prohibiting the friars of his order from publishing books or pamphlets without prior approval. He was likely kept at constant menial tasks to limit his time for contemplation and came to view his treatment as an enforced absence from scholarly life.By the mid-1260s, he was undertaking a search for patrons who could secure permission and funding for his return to Oxford. For a time, Bacon was finally able to get around his superiors' interference through his acquaintance with Guy de Foulques, bishop of Narbonne, cardinal of Sabina, and the papal legate who negotiated between England's royal and baronial factions.In 1263 or 1264, a message garbled by Bacon's messenger, Raymond of Laon, led Guy to believe that Bacon had already completed a summary of the sciences. In fact, he had no money to research, let alone copy, such a work and attempts to secure financing from his family were thwarted by the Second Barons' War. However, in 1265, Guy was summoned to a conclave at Perugia that elected him Pope Clement IV. William Benecor, who had previously been the courier between Henry III and the pope, now carried the correspondence between Bacon and Clement. Clement's reply of 22 June 1266 commissioned \"writings and remedies for current conditions\", instructing Bacon not to violate any standing \"prohibitions\" of his order but to carry out his task in utmost secrecy.While faculties of the time were largely limited to addressing disputes on the known texts of Aristotle, Clement's patronage permitted Bacon to engage in a wide-ranging consideration of the state of knowledge in his era. In 1267 or '68, Bacon sent the Pope his Opus Majus, which presented his views on how to incorporate Aristotelian logic and science into a new theology, supporting Grosseteste's text-based approach against the \"sentence method\" then fashionable.Bacon also sent his Opus Minus, De Multiplicatione Specierum, De Speculis Comburentibus, an optical lens, and possibly other works on alchemy and astrology. The entire process has been called \"one of the most remarkable single efforts of literary productivity\", with Bacon composing referenced works of around a million words in about a year.Pope Clement died in 1268 and Bacon lost his protector. The Condemnations of 1277 banned the teaching of certain philosophical doctrines, including deterministic astrology. Some time within the next two years, Bacon was apparently imprisoned or placed under house arrest. This was traditionally ascribed to Franciscan Minister General Jerome of Ascoli, probably acting on behalf of the many clergy, monks, and educators attacked by Bacon's 1271 Compendium Studii Philosophiae.Modern scholarship, however, notes that the first reference to Bacon's \"imprisonment\" dates from eighty years after his death on the charge of unspecified \"suspected novelties\" and finds it less than credible. Contemporary scholars who do accept Bacon's imprisonment typically associate it with Bacon's \"attraction to contemporary prophesies\", his sympathies for \"the radical 'poverty' wing of the Franciscans\", interest in certain astrological doctrines, or generally combative personality rather than from \"any scientific novelties which he may have proposed\".Sometime after 1278, Bacon returned to the Franciscan House at Oxford, where he continued his studies and is presumed to have spent most of the remainder of his life. His last dateable writing\u2014the Compendium Studii Theologiae\u2014was completed in 1292. He seems to have died shortly afterwards and been buried at Oxford.\n\n\n== Works ==\n\nMedieval European philosophy often relied on appeals to the authority of Church Fathers such as St Augustine, and on works by Plato and Aristotle only known at second hand or through Latin translations. By the 13th century, new works and better versions \u2013 in Arabic or in new Latin translations from the Arabic \u2013 began to trickle north from Muslim Spain. In Roger Bacon's writings, he upholds Aristotle's calls for the collection of facts before deducing scientific truths, against the practices of his contemporaries, arguing that \"thence cometh quiet to the mind\".\nBacon also called for reform with regard to theology. He argued that, rather than training to debate minor philosophical distinctions, theologians should focus their attention primarily on the Bible itself, learning the languages of its original sources thoroughly. He was fluent in several of these languages and was able to note and bemoan several corruptions of scripture, and of the works of the Greek philosophers that had been mistranslated or misinterpreted by scholars working in Latin. He also argued for the education of theologians in science (\"natural philosophy\") and its addition to the medieval curriculum.\n\n\n=== Opus Majus ===\n\nBacon's 1267 Greater Work, the Opus Majus, contains treatments of mathematics, optics, alchemy, and astronomy, including theories on the positions and sizes of the celestial bodies. It is divided into seven sections: \"The Four General Causes of Human Ignorance\" (Causae Erroris), \"The Affinity of Philosophy with Theology\" (Philosophiae cum Theologia Affinitas), \"On the Usefulness of Grammar\" (De Utilitate Grammaticae), \"The Usefulness of Mathematics in Physics\" (Mathematicae in Physicis Utilitas), \"On the Science of Perspective\" (De Scientia Perspectivae), \"On Experimental Knowledge\" (De Scientia Experimentali), and \"A Philosophy of Morality\" (Moralis Philosophia).It was not intended as a complete work but as a \"persuasive preamble\" (persuasio praeambula), an enormous proposal for a reform of the medieval university curriculum and the establishment of a kind of library or encyclopedia, bringing in experts to compose a collection of definitive texts on these subjects. The new subjects were to be \"perspective\" (i.e., optics), \"astronomy\" (inclusive of astronomy proper, astrology, and the geography necessary in order to use them), \"weights\" (likely some treatment of mechanics but this section of the Opus Majus has been lost), alchemy, agriculture (inclusive of botany and zoology), medicine, and \"experimental science\", a philosophy of science that would guide the others. The section on geography was allegedly originally ornamented with a map based on ancient and Arabic computations of longitude and latitude, but has since been lost. His (mistaken) arguments supporting the idea that dry land formed the larger proportion of the globe were apparently similar to those which later guided Columbus.In this work Bacon criticises his contemporaries Alexander of Hales and Albertus Magnus, who were held in high repute despite having only acquired their knowledge of Aristotle at second hand during their preaching careers. Albert was received at Paris as an authority equal to Aristotle, Avicenna and Averroes, a situation Bacon decried: \"never in the world [had] such monstrosity occurred before.\"In Part I of the Opus Majus Bacon recognises some philosophers as the Sapientes, or gifted few, and saw their knowledge in philosophy and theology as superior to the vulgus philosophantium, or common herd of philosophers. He held Islamic thinkers between 1210 and 1265 in especially high regard calling them \"both philosophers and sacred writers\" and defended the integration of Islamic philosophy into Christian learning.\n\n\n==== Calendrical reform ====\n\nIn Part IV of the Opus Majus, Bacon proposed a calendrical reform similar to the later system introduced in 1582 under Pope Gregory XIII. Drawing on ancient Greek and medieval Islamic astronomy recently introduced to western Europe via Spain, Bacon continued the work of Robert Grosseteste and criticised the then-current Julian calendar as \"intolerable, horrible, and laughable\".\nIt had become apparent that Eudoxus and Sosigenes's assumption of a year of 365\u00bc days was, over the course of centuries, too inexact. Bacon charged that this meant the computation of Easter had shifted forward by 9 days since the First Council of Nicaea in 325. His proposal to drop one day every 125 years and to cease the observance of fixed equinoxes and solstices was not acted upon following the death of Pope Clement IV in 1268. The eventual Gregorian calendar drops one day from the first three centuries in each set of 400 years.\n\n\n==== Optics ====\n\nIn Part V of the Opus Majus, Bacon discusses physiology of eyesight and the anatomy of the eye and the brain, considering light, distance, position, and size, direct and reflected vision, refraction, mirrors, and lenses. His treatment was primarily oriented by the Latin translation of Alhazen's Book of Optics. He also draws heavily on Eugene of Palermo's Latin translation of the Arabic translation of Ptolemy's Optics; on Robert Grosseteste's work based on Al-Kindi's Optics;  and, through Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham), on Ibn Sahl's work on dioptrics.\n\n\n==== Gunpowder ====\n\nA passage in the Opus Majus and another in the Opus Tertium are usually taken as the first European descriptions of a mixture containing the essential ingredients of gunpowder. Partington and others have come to the conclusion that Bacon most likely witnessed at least one demonstration of Chinese firecrackers, possibly obtained by Franciscans\u2014including Bacon's friend William of Rubruck\u2014who visited the Mongol Empire during this period. The most telling passage reads:\n\nWe have an example of these things (that act on the senses) in [the sound and fire of] that children's toy which is made in many [diverse] parts of the world; i.e. a device no bigger than one's thumb. From the violence of that salt called saltpetre [together with sulphur and willow charcoal, combined into a powder] so horrible a sound is made by the bursting of a thing so small, no more than a bit of parchment [containing it], that we find [the ear assaulted by a noise] exceeding the roar of strong thunder, and a flash brighter than the most brilliant lightning. \nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Henry William Lovett Hime of the Royal Artillery published the theory that Bacon's Epistola contained a cryptogram giving a recipe for the gunpowder he witnessed. The theory was criticised by Thorndike in a 1915 letter to Science and several books, a position joined by Muir, Stillman, Steele, and Sarton. Needham et al. concurred with these earlier critics that the additional passage did not originate with Bacon and further showed that the proportions supposedly deciphered (a 7:5:5 ratio of saltpetre to charcoal to sulphur) as not even useful for firecrackers, burning slowly with a great deal of smoke and failing to ignite inside a gun barrel. The ~41% nitrate content is too low to have explosive properties.\n\n\n=== Secret of Secrets ===\n\nBacon attributed the Secret of Secrets (Secretum Secretorum), the Islamic \"Mirror of Princes\" (Arabic: Sirr al-\u02bfasrar\u200e), to Aristotle, thinking that he had composed it for Alexander the Great. Bacon produced an edition of Philip of Tripoli's Latin translation, complete with his own introduction and notes; and his writings of the 1260s and 1270s cite it far more than his contemporaries did. This led Easton and others, including Robert Steele, to argue that the text spurred Bacon's own transformation into an experimentalist. (Bacon never described such a decisive impact himself.) The dating of Bacon's edition of the Secret of Secrets is a key piece of evidence in the debate, with those arguing for a greater impact giving it an earlier date; but it certainly influenced the elder Bacon's conception of the political aspects of his work in the sciences.\n\n\n=== Alchemy ===\n\nBacon has been credited with a number of alchemical texts.The Letter on the Secret Workings of Art and Nature and on the Vanity of Magic (Epistola de Secretis Operibus Artis et Naturae et de Nullitate Magiae), also known as On the Wonderful Powers of Art and Nature (De Mirabili Potestate Artis et Naturae), a likely-forged letter to an unknown \"William of Paris,\" dismisses practices such as necromancy but contains most of the alchemical formulae attributed to Bacon, including one for a philosopher's stone and another possibly for gunpowder. It also includes several passages about hypothetical flying machines and submarines, attributing their first use to Alexander the Great. On the Vanity of Magic or The Nullity of Magic is a debunking of esoteric claims in Bacon's time, showing that they could be explained by natural phenomena.\n\n\n=== Linguistics ===\n\nBacon's early linguistic and logical works are the Overview of Grammar (Summa Grammatica), Summa de Sophismatibus et Distinctionibus, and the Summulae Dialectices or Summulae super Totam Logicam. These are mature but essentially conventional presentations of Oxford and Paris's terminist and pre-modist logic and grammar. His later work in linguistics is much more idiosyncratic, using terminology and addressing questions unique in his era.In his Greek and Hebrew Grammars (Grammatica Graeca and Hebraica), in his work \"On the Usefulness of Grammar\" (Book III of the Opus Majus), and in his Compendium of the Study of Philosophy, Bacon stresses the need for scholars to know several languages. Europe's vernacular languages are not ignored\u2014he considers them useful for practical purposes such as trade, proselytism, and administration\u2014but Bacon is mostly interested in his era's languages of science and religion: Arabic, Greek, Hebrew and Latin.Bacon is less interested in a full practical mastery of the other languages than on a theoretical understanding of their grammatical rules, ensuring that a Latin reader will not misunderstand passages' original meaning. For this reason, his treatments of Greek and Hebrew grammar are not isolated works on their topic but contrastive grammars treating the aspects which influenced Latin or which were required for properly understanding Latin texts. He pointedly states, \"I want to describe Greek grammar for the benefit of Latin speakers\". It is likely only this limited sense which was intended by Bacon's boast that he could teach an interested pupil a new language within three days.Passages in the Overview and the Greek grammar have been taken as an early exposition of a universal grammar underlying all human languages. The Greek grammar contains the tersest and most famous exposition:\nGrammar is one and the same in all languages, substantially, though it may vary, accidentally, in each of them.\nHowever, Bacon's lack of interest in studying a literal grammar underlying the languages known to him and his numerous works on linguistics and comparative linguistics has prompted Hovdhaugen to question the usual literal translation of Bacon's grammatica in such passages. She notes the ambiguity in the Latin term, which could refer variously to the structure of language, to its description, and to the science underlying such descriptions: i.e., linguistics.\n\n\n=== Other works ===\n\nBacon states that his Lesser Work (Opus Minus) and Third Work (Opus Tertium) were originally intended as summaries of the Opus Majus in case it was lost in transit. Easton's review of the texts suggests that they became separate works over the course of the laborious process of creating a fair copy of the Opus Majus, whose half-million words were copied by hand and apparently greatly revised at least once.Other works by Bacon include his \"Tract on the Multiplication of Species\" (Tractatus de Multiplicatione Specierum), \"On Burning Lenses\" (De Speculis Comburentibus), the Communia Naturalium and Mathematica, the \"Compendium of the Study of Philosophy\" and \"of Theology\" (Compendium Studii Philosophiae and Theologiae), and his Computus. The \"Compendium of the Study of Theology\", presumably written in the last years of his life, was an anticlimax: adding nothing new, it is principally devoted to the concerns of the 1260s.\n\n\n=== Apocrypha ===\nThe Mirror of Alchimy (Speculum Alchemiae), a short treatise on the origin and composition of metals, is traditionally credited to Bacon. It espouses the Arabian theory of mercury and sulphur forming the other metals, with vague allusions to transmutation. Stillman opined that \"there is nothing in it that is characteristic of Roger Bacon's style or ideas, nor that distinguishes it from many unimportant alchemical lucubrations of anonymous writers of the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries\", and Muir and Lippmann also considered it a pseudepigraph.The cryptic Voynich manuscript has been attributed to Bacon by various sources, including by its first recorded owner, but historians of science Lynn Thorndike and George Sarton dismissed these claims as unsupported. and the vellum of the manuscript has since been dated to the 15th century.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nBacon was largely ignored by his contemporaries in favor of other scholars such as Albertus Magnus, Bonaventure, and Thomas Aquinas, although his works were studied by Bonaventure, John Pecham, and Peter of Limoges, through whom he may have influenced Raymond Lull. He was also partially responsible for the addition of optics (perspectiva) to the medieval university curriculum.By the early modern period, the English considered him the epitome of a wise and subtle possessor of forbidden knowledge, a Faust-like magician who had tricked the devil and so was able to go to heaven. Of these legends, one of the most prominent was that he created a talking brazen head which could answer any question. The story appears in the anonymous 16th-century account of The Famous Historie of Fryer Bacon, in which Bacon speaks with a demon but causes the head to speak by \"the continuall fume of the six hottest Simples\", testing his theory that speech is caused by \"an effusion of vapors\".Around 1589, Robert Greene adapted the story for the stage as The Honorable Historie of Frier Bacon and Frier Bongay, one of the most successful Elizabethan comedies. As late as the 1640s, Thomas Browne was still complaining that \"Every ear is filled with the story of Frier Bacon, that made a brazen head to speak these words, Time is\". Greene's Bacon spent seven years creating a brass head that would speak \"strange and uncouth aphorisms\" to enable him to encircle Britain with a wall of brass that would make it impossible to conquer.\nUnlike his source material, Greene does not cause his head to operate by natural forces but by \"nigromantic charms\" and \"the enchanting forces of the devil\": i.e., by entrapping a dead spirit or hobgoblin. Bacon collapses, exhausted, just before his device comes to life and announces \"Time is\", \"Time was\", and \"Time is Past\" before being destroyed in spectacular fashion: the stage direction instructs that \"a lightening flasheth forth, and a hand appears that breaketh down the Head with a hammer\".A necromantic head was ascribed to Pope Sylvester II as early as the 1120s, but Browne considered the legend to be a misunderstanding of a passage in Peter the Good's c.\u20091335 Precious Pearl where the negligent alchemist misses the birth of his creation and loses it forever. The story may also preserve the work by Bacon and his contemporaries to construct clockwork armillary spheres. Bacon had praised a \"self-activated working model of the heavens\" as \"the greatest of all things which have been devised\".As early as the 16th century, natural philosophers like Bruno, Dee, and Francis Bacon were attempting to rehabilitate Bacon's reputation and to portray him as a scientific pioneer who had avoided the petty bickering of his contemporaries to attempt a rational understanding of nature. By the 19th century, commenters following Whewell considered that \"Bacon... was not appreciated in his age because he was so completely in advance of it; he is a 16th- or 17th-century philosopher, whose lot has been by some accident cast in the 13th century\". His assertions in the Opus Majus that \"theories supplied by reason should be verified by sensory data, aided by instruments, and corroborated by trustworthy witnesses\" were (and still are) considered \"one of the first important formulations of the scientific method on record\".This idea that Bacon was a modern experimental scientist reflected two views of the period: that the principal form of scientific activity is experimentation and that 13th-century Europe still represented the \"Dark Ages\". This view, which is still reflected in some 21st-century popular science books, portrays Bacon as an advocate of modern experimental science who emerged as a solitary genius in an age hostile to his ideas. Based on Bacon's apocrypha, he is also portrayed as a visionary who predicted the invention of the submarine, aircraft, and automobile.However, in the course of the 20th century, Husserl, Heidegger and others emphasised the importance to modern science of Cartesian and Galilean projections of mathematics over sensory perceptions of nature; Heidegger in particular noted the lack of such an understanding in Bacon's works. Although Crombie, Kuhn and Schramm continued to argue for Bacon's importance to the development of \"qualitative\" areas of modern science, Duhem, Thorndike, Carton and Koyr\u00e9 emphasised the essentially medieval nature of Bacon's scientia experimentalis.Research also established that Bacon was not as isolated\u2014and probably not as persecuted\u2014as was once thought. Many medieval sources of and influences on Bacon's scientific activity have been identified. In particular, Bacon often mentioned his debt to the work of Robert Grosseteste: his work on optics and the calendar followed Grosseteste's lead, as did his idea that inductively-derived conclusions should be submitted for verification through experimental testing.Bacon noted of William of Sherwood that \"nobody was greater in philosophy than he\"; praised Peter of Maricourt (the author of \"A Letter on Magnetism\") and John of London as \"perfect\" mathematicians; Campanus of Novara (the author of works on astronomy, astrology, and the calendar) and a Master Nicholas as \"good\"; and acknowledged the influence of Adam Marsh and lesser figures. He was clearly not an isolated genius. The medieval church was also not generally opposed to scientific investigation and medieval science was both varied and extensive.As a result, the picture of Bacon has changed. Bacon is now seen as part of his age: a leading figure in the beginnings of the medieval universities at Paris and Oxford but one joined in the development of the philosophy of science by Robert Grosseteste, William of Auvergne, Henry of Ghent, Albert Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, John Duns Scotus, and William of Ockham. Lindberg summarised:\n\nBacon was not a modern, out of step with his age, or a harbinger of things to come, but a brilliant, combative, and somewhat eccentric schoolman of the thirteenth century, endeavoring to take advantage of the new learning just becoming available while remaining true to traditional notions... of the importance to be attached to philosophical knowledge\".\nA recent review of the many visions of Bacon across the ages says contemporary scholarship still neglects one of the most important aspects of his life and thought: his commitment to the Franciscan order. \n\nHis Opus majus was a plea for reform addressed to the supreme spiritual head of the Christian faith, written against a background of apocalyptic expectation and informed by the driving concerns of the friars. It was designed to improve training for missionaries and to provide new skills to be employed in the defence of the Christian world against the enmity of non-Christians and of the Antichrist. It cannot usefully be read solely in the context of the history of science and philosophy.\nWith regard to religion's influence on Bacon's philosophy, Charles Sanders Peirce noted, \"To Roger Bacon,... the schoolmen's conception of reasoning appeared only an obstacle to truth... [but] Of all kinds of experience, the best, he thought, was interior illumination, which teaches many things about Nature which the external senses could never discover, such as the transubstantiation of bread.\"In Oxford lore, Bacon is credited as the namesake of Folly Bridge for having gotten himself placed under house arrest nearby. Although this is probably untrue, it had formerly been known as \"Friar Bacon's Bridge\". Bacon is also honoured at Oxford by a plaque affixed to the wall of the new Westgate shopping centre.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\n\nTo commemorate the 700th anniversary of Bacon's approximate year of birth, Prof. J. Erskine wrote the biographical play A Pageant of the Thirteenth Century, which was performed and published by Columbia University in 1914. A fictionalised account of Bacon's life and times also appears in the second book of James Blish's After Such Knowledge trilogy, the 1964 Doctor Mirabilis. Bacon serves as a mentor to the protagonists of Thomas Costain's 1945 The Black Rose, and Umberto Eco's 1980 The Name of the Rose.Greene's play prompted a less successful sequel John of Bordeaux and was recast as a children's story for James Baldwin's 1905 Thirty More Famous Stories Retold. \"The Brazen Head of Friar Bacon\" also appears in Daniel Defoe's 1722 Journal of the Plague Year, Nathaniel Hawthorne's 1843 \"The Birth-Mark\" and 1844 \"The Artist of the Beautiful\", William Douglas O'Connor's 1891 \"The Brazen Android\" (where Bacon devises it to terrify King Henry into accepting Simon de Montfort's demands for greater democracy), John Cowper Powys's 1956 The Brazen Head, and Robertson Davies's 1970 Fifth Business.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBaco, a lunar crater named for Roger Bacon\nHistory of geomagnetism, of translation, of the scientific method, and of science in the Middle Ages\nJohn of St Amand\nList of Catholic clergy scientists\nOxford Franciscan school\nRoger Bacon High School\nVitello\nWilfrid Voynich\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Citations ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== External links ==\nHackett, Jeremiah. \"Roger Bacon\".

In the early modern era, he was regarded as a wizard and particularly famed for the story of his mechanical or necromantic brazen head. He is sometimes credited (mainly since the 19th century) as one of the earliest European advocates of the modern scientific method. Bacon applied the empirical method of Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) to observations in texts attributed to Aristotle. Bacon discovered the importance of empirical testing when the results he obtained were different from those that would have been predicted by Aristotle.His linguistic work has been heralded for its early exposition of a universal grammar. 21st century re-evaluations emphasise that Bacon was essentially a medieval thinker, with much of his \"experimental\" knowledge obtained from books in the scholastic tradition. He was, however, partially responsible for a revision of the medieval university curriculum, which saw the addition of optics to the traditional quadrivium.Bacon's major work, the Opus Majus, was sent to Pope Clement IV in Rome in 1267 upon the pope's request. Although gunpowder was first invented and described in China, Bacon was the first in Europe to record its formula."}, "Books_of_the_Balances": {"links": ["Themistius", "Jabir", "Doi ", "Ancient Greek philosophy", "Roger Bacon", "Albertus Magnus", "Aristotelianism", "Arab", "Iraq", "Eug\u00e8ne Canseliet", "Salomon Trismosin", "Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz", "Fasciculus Chemicus", "The Discourse on the Eighth and Ninth", "Ahmad ibn 'Imad al-Din", "Deutsches Theatrum Chemicum", "Apollonius of Tyana", "Patronymic", "Category of being", "Astrolabe", "Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa", "Bibliographer", "Musaeum Hermeticum", "Ramon Llull", "Trove ", "Abu Sulayman Sijistani", "Porphyry ", "Hdl ", "Frater Albertus", "Asclepius ", "Jan Baptist van Helmont", "Michael Sendivogius", "The Book of the Composition of Alchemy", "Johann of Laz", "Clavis sapientiae", "Jakob B\u00f6hme", "Khalid ibn Yazid", "Michael Scot", "Ortolanus", "Cyranides", "Summa perfectionis", "One Hundred and Twelve Books", "Samuel Norton ", "Magnum opus ", "Splendor Solis", "Maslama al-Majriti", "Ammonium chloride", "Book of Mercy ", "List of alchemical substances", "Archigenes", "Tarsus, Mersin", "Kitab al-Istamakhis", "Abbasid Revolution", "TDV\u0130A ", "Liber Hermetis ", "Alembic", "The Kybalion", "Theurgy", "Zosimos of Panopolis", "Isma'ilism", "Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn", "Chinese alchemy", "Syriac language", "Archimedes", "Khurasan", "Ahmad Y. al-Hassan", "History of music theory", "Alphidius", "Alexander of Aphrodisias", "Astrology", "Athanor", "Abu Mansur Muwaffaq", "Hellenization", "One Thousand and One Nights", "Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati", "Science in medieval Islam", "Mawla", "Aristotle", "Latinisation of names", "Ghulat", "Caliph", "Ibn al-Baitar", "Logic in Islamic philosophy", "Kunya ", "South Arabia", "Alchemical symbol", "Hermeticism", "Seventy Books", "Fire ", "Physika kai mystika", "Marcellin Berthelot", "Nisba ", "Azd", "Syed Nomanul Haq", "Gold", "History of botany", "NTA ", "Abu'l Hasan ibn Arfa Ra'a", "Torah", "Julius Ruska", "On the Soul", "Carl Jung", "Ab\u016b Hayy\u0101n al-Tawh\u012bd\u012b", "Pseudonym", "Sirr al-khaliqa", "Cataloging", "Paul Kraus ", "Giovanni Mercurio da Correggio", "Sasanian Empire", "History of chemistry", "Hasan al-Rammah", "Buch der heiligen Dreifaltigkeit", "Madhhab", "Mutus Liber", "PMID ", "De consideratione quintae essentiae", "Gerard of Cremona", "Status quaestionis", "Robert Boyle", "Arnaldus de Villa Nova", "History of zoology through one thousand, eight hundred and fifty-nine", "Aurora consurgens", "Ibn Rassam", "Takwin", "John Dee", "NKC ", "Al-Zahrawi", "Earth ", "Al-Fihrist", "RERO ", "Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum", "Chymes", "Ja'far ibn Yahya", "History of meteorology", "StwoCID ", "VIAF ", "Giovanni Pico della Mirandola", "Sulfur", "Liber Ignium", "SELIBR ", "Pseudepigrapha", "Metals of antiquity", "Hennig Brand", "Mercury ", "Euclid", "Isaac Newton", "Jean de Roquetaillade", "Petrus Bonus", "Sirr al-asrar ", "Henry Corbin", "Ostanes", "Hermetica", "Abul Ashba ibn Tammam", "Astrology in medieval Islam", "Bactria", "Ouroboros", "William R.

The works that survive today mainly deal with alchemy and chemistry, magic, and Shi'ite religious philosophy. However, the original scope of the corpus was vast and diverse, covering a wide range of topics ranging from cosmology, astronomy and astrology, over medicine, pharmacology, zoology and botany, to metaphysics, logic, and grammar.\nJabir's works contain the oldest known systematic classification of chemical substances, and the oldest known instructions for deriving an inorganic compound (sal ammoniac or ammonium chloride) from organic substances (such as plants, blood, and hair) by chemical means. His works also contain one of the earliest known versions of the sulfur-mercury theory of metals, a mineralogical theory that would remain dominant until the 18th century.\nA significant part of Jabir's writings were informed by a philosophical theory known as \"the science of the balance\" (Arabic: \u02bfilm al-m\u012bz\u0101n), which was aimed at reducing all phenomena (including material substances and their elements) to a system of measures and quantitative proportions. The Jabirian works also contain some of the earliest preserved Shi'ite eschatological, soteriological and imamological doctrines, which Jabir presented as deriving from his purported master, the Shi'ite Imam Ja\u02bffar al-\u1e62\u0101diq.\nAs early as the 10th century, the identity and exact corpus of works of Jabir was in dispute in Islamic scholarly circles. The authorship of all these works by a single figure, and even the existence of a historical Jabir, are also doubted by modern scholars. Instead, Jabir ibn Hayyan is thought to have been a pseudonym used by an anonymous school of Shi'ite alchemists writing in the late 9th and early 10th centuries.\nSome Arabic Jabirian works (e.g., The Great Book of Mercy, and The Book of Seventy) were translated into Latin under the Latinized name \"Geber\", and in 13th-century Europe an anonymous writer, usually referred to as pseudo-Geber, started to produce alchemical and metallurgical writings under this name.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\n\n=== Historicity ===\nIt is not clear whether Jabir ibn Hayyan ever existed as a historical person. He is purported to have lived in the 8th century, and to have been a disciple of the Shi'ite Imam Ja\u02bffar al-\u1e62\u0101diq (died 765). However, he is not mentioned in any historical source before c. 900, and the first known author to write about Jabir from a biographical point of view was the Baghdadi bibliographer Ibn al-Nad\u012bm (c. 932\u2013995). In his Fihrist (\"The Book Catalogue\", written in 987), Ibn al-Nad\u012bm compiled a list of Jabir's works, adding a short notice on the various claims that were then circulating about Jabir. Already in Ibn al-Nad\u012bm's time, there were some people who explicitly asserted that Jabir had never existed, although Ibn al-Nad\u012bm himself disagreed with this claim. Jabir was often ignored by medieval Islamic biographers and historians, but especially significant is the fact that early Shi'ite biographers such as A\u1e25mad al-Barq\u012b (died c. 893), Ab\u016b \u02bfAmr al-Kashsh\u012b (first half of the 10th century), A\u1e25mad ibn \u02bfAl\u012b al-Naj\u0101sh\u012b (983\u20131058), and Ab\u016b Ja\u02bffar al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b (995\u20131067), who wrote long volumes on the companions of the Shi'ite Imams (including the many companions of Ja\u02bffar al-\u1e62\u0101diq), did not mention Jabir at all.\n\n\n=== Dating of the Jabirian corpus ===\nApart from outright denying his existence, there were also some who, already in Ibn al-Nad\u012bm's time, questioned whether the writings attributed to Jabir were really written by him. The authenticity of these writings was expressly denied by the Bagdhadi philosopher Ab\u016b Sulaym\u0101n al-Sijist\u0101n\u012b (c. 912\u2013985) and his pupil Ab\u016b \u1e24ayy\u0101n al-Taw\u1e25\u012bd\u012b (c. 932\u20131023), though this may have been related to the hostility of both these thinkers to alchemy in general. Modern scholarly analysis has tended to confirm the inauthenticity of the writings attributed to Jabir. Much of the philosophical terminology used in the Jabirian treatises was only coined around the middle of the 9th century, and some of the Greek philosophical texts cited in the Jabirian writings are known to have been translated into Arabic towards the end of the 9th century. Moreover, an important part of the corpus deals with early Shi'ite religious philosophy that is elsewhere only attested in late 9th-century and early 10th-century sources. As a result, the dating of the Jabirian corpus to c. 850\u2013950 has been widely accepted in modern scholarship. However, it has also been noted that many Jabirian treatises show clear signs of having been redacted multiple times, and the writings as we now have them may well have been based on an earlier 8th-century core. Despite the obscurity involved, it is not impossible that some of these writings, in their earliest form, were written by a real Jabir ibn Hayyan. In any case, it is clear that Jabir's name was used as a pseudonym by one or more anonymous Shi'ite alchemists writing in the late 9th and early 10th centuries, who also redacted the corpus as we now know it.\n\n\n=== Biographical clues and legend ===\nJabir was generally known by the kunya Ab\u016b M\u016bs\u0101 (\"Father of M\u016bs\u0101\"), or sometimes Ab\u016b \u2018Abd All\u0101h (\"Father of \u2018Abd All\u0101h\"), and by the nisbas (attributive names) al-\u1e62\u016bf\u012b, al-Azd\u012b, al-K\u016bf\u012b, or al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b. The name al-Azd\u012b points to his affiliation with the Southern-Arabian (Yemenite) tribe of the Azd. However, it is not clear whether Jabir was an Arab belonging to the Azd tribe, or a non-Arab Muslim client (mawl\u0101) of the Azd. According to Ibn al-Nad\u012bm, Jabir hailed from Khurasan (eastern Iran), but spent most of his life in Kufa (Iraq). Since the Azd were firmly established both in Kufa and in Khurasan, Jabir may well have been a descendant of the Arab settlers in Khurasan. If, however, he was a non-Arab Muslim client of the Azd, he is most likely to have been Iranian, given his ties with eastern Iran (his nisba al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b also points to Tus, a city in Khurasan). Various late reports put his date of death between 806 (190 AH) and 816 (200 AH).Given the lack of independent biographical sources, most of the biographical information about Jabir can be traced back to the Jabirian writings themselves. There are references throughout the Jabirian corpus to the Shi'ite Imam Ja\u02bffar al-\u1e62\u0101diq (died 765), whom Jabir generally calls \"my master\" (Arabic: sayyid\u012b), and whom he represents as the original source of all his knowledge. In one work, Jabir is also represented as an associate of the Bactrian vizier family of the Barmakids, whereas Ibn al-Nad\u012bm reports that some claimed Jabir to have been especially devoted to Ja\u02bffar ibn Ya\u1e25y\u0101 al-Barmak\u012b (767\u2013803), the Abbasid vizier of One Thousand and One Nights fame. Jabir's links with the Abbasids were stressed even more by later tradition, which turned him into a favorite of the Abbasid caliph H\u0101r\u016bn Ar-Rash\u012bd (c. 763\u2013809, also of One Thousand and One Nights fame), for whom Jabir would have composed a treatise on alchemy, and who would have commanded the translation of Greek works into Arabic on Jabir's instigation.Given Jabir's purported ties with both the Shi'ite Imam Ja\u02bffar al-\u1e62\u0101diq and the Barmakid family (who served the Abbasids as viziers), or with the Abbasid caliphs themselves, it has sometimes been thought plausible that \u1e24ayy\u0101n al-\u02bfA\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101r (\"Hayyan the Druggist\"), a proto-Shi'ite activist who was fighting for the Abbasid cause in the early 8th century, may have been Jabir's father (Jabir's name \"Ibn Hayyan\" literally means \"The Son of Hayyan\"). Although there is no direct evidence supporting this hypothesis, it fits very well in the historical context, and it allows us to think of Jabir, however obscure, as a historical figure. However, it has recently been shown that \u1e24ayy\u0101n al-\u02bfA\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101r was a client (mawl\u0101) of the Nakha\u02bf tribe, which renders it highly improbable that he should have been the father of Jabir.\n\n\n== The Jabirian corpus ==\nThere are about 600 Arabic works attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan that are known by name, approximately 215 of which are still extant today. Though some of these are full-length works (e.g., The Great Book on Specific Properties), most of them are relatively short treatises and belong to larger collections (The One Hundred and Twelve Books, The Five Hundred Books, etc.) in which they function rather more like chapters. When the individual chapters of some full-length works are counted as separate treatises too, the total length of the corpus may be estimated at about 3000 treatises/chapters.The overwhelming majority of Jabirian treatises that are still extant today deal with alchemy or chemistry (though these may also contain religious speculations, and discuss a wide range of other topics ranging from cosmology to grammar). Nevertheless, there are also a few extant treatises which deal with magic, i.e., \"the science of talismans\" (\u02bfilm al-\u1e6dilasm\u0101t, a form of theurgy) and \"the science of specific properties\" (\u02bfilm al-khaw\u0101\u1e63\u1e63, the science dealing with the hidden powers of mineral, vegetable and animal substances, and with their practical applications in medical and various other pursuits). Other writings dealing with a great variety of subjects were also attributed to Jabir (this includes such subjects as engineering, medicine, pharmacology, zoology, botany, logic, metaphysics, mathematics, astronomy and astrology), but almost all of these are lost today.\n\n\n=== Alchemical writings ===\nNote that Paul Kraus, who first catalogued the Jabirian writings and whose numbering will be followed here, conceived of his division of Jabir's alchemical writings (Kr. nos. 5\u20131149) as roughly chronological in order.\nThe Great Book of Mercy (Kit\u0101b al-Ra\u1e25ma al-kab\u012br, Kr. no. 5): This was considered by Kraus to be the oldest work in the corpus, from which it may have been relatively independent. Some 10th-century skeptics considered it to be the only authentic work written by Jabir himself. The Persian physician, alchemist and philosopher Ab\u016b Bakr al-R\u0101z\u012b (c. 854\u2013925) appears to have written a (lost) commentary on it. It was translated into Latin in the 13th century under the title Liber Misericordiae.\nThe One Hundred and Twelve Books (al-Kutub al-mi\u02bea wa-l-ithn\u0101 \u02bfashar, Kr. nos. 6\u2013122): This collection consists of relatively independent treatises dealing with different practical aspects of alchemy, often framed as an explanation of the symbolic allusions of the 'ancients'. An important role is played by organic alchemy. Its theoretical foundations are similar to those of The Seventy Books (i.e., the reduction of bodies to the elements fire, air, water and earth, and of the elements to the 'natures' hot, cold, moist, and dry), though their exposition is less systematic. Just like in The Seventy Books, the quantitative directions in The One Hundred and Twelve Books are still of a practical and 'experimental' rather than of a theoretical and speculative nature, such as will be the case in The Books of the Balances. The first four treatises in this collection, i.e., the three-part Book of the Element of the Foundation (Kit\u0101b Us\u1e6duqus al-uss, Kr. nos. 6\u20138, the second part of which contains an early version of the famous Emerald Tablet attributed to Hermes Trismegistus) and a commentary on it (Tafs\u012br kit\u0101b al-us\u1e6duqus, Kr. no. 9), have been translated into English.\nThe Seventy Books (al-Kutub al-sab\u02bf\u016bn, Kr. nos. 123\u2013192) (also called The Book of Seventy, Kit\u0101b al-Sab\u02bf\u012bn): This contains a systematic exposition of Jabirian alchemy, in which the several treatises form a much more unified whole as compared to The One Hundred and Twelve Books. It is organized into seven parts, containing ten treatises each: three parts dealing with the preparation of the elixir from animal, vegetable, and mineral substances, respectively; two parts dealing with the four elements from a theoretical and practical point of view, respectively; one part focusing on the alchemical use of animal substances, and one part focusing on minerals and metals. It was translated into Latin by Gerard of Cremona (c. 1114\u20131187) under the title Liber de Septuaginta.\nTen books added to the Seventy (\u02bfasharat kutub mu\u1e0d\u0101fa il\u0101 l-sab\u02bf\u012bn, Kr. nos. 193\u2013202): The sole surviving treatise from this small collection (The Book of Clarification, Kit\u0101b al-\u012a\u1e0d\u0101\u1e25, Kr. no. 195) briefly discusses the different methods for preparing the elixir, criticizing the philosophers who have only expounded the method of preparing the elixir starting from mineral substances, to the exclusion of vegetable and animal substances.\nThe Ten Books of Rectifications (al-Mu\u1e63a\u1e25\u1e25a\u1e25\u0101t al-\u02bfashara, Kr. nos. 203\u2013212): Relates the successive improvements (\u201crectifications\u201d, mu\u1e63a\u1e25\u1e25a\u1e25\u0101t) brought to the art by such 'alchemists' as 'Pythagoras' (Kr. no. 203), 'Socrates' (Kr. no. 204), 'Plato' (Kr. no. 205), 'Aristotle' (Kr. no. 206), 'Archigenes' (Kr. nos. 207\u2013208), 'Homer' (Kr. no. 209), 'Democritus' (Kr. no. 210), \u1e24arb\u012b al-\u1e24imyar\u012b (Kr. no. 211), and Jabir himself (Kr. no. 212). The only surviving treatise from this small collection (The Book of the Rectifications of Plato, Kit\u0101b Mu\u1e63a\u1e25\u1e25a\u1e25\u0101t Ifl\u0101\u1e6d\u016bn, Kr. no. 205) is divided into 90 chapters:  20 chapters on processes using only mercury, 10 chapters on processes using mercury and one additional 'medicine' (daw\u0101\u02be), 30 chapters on processes using mercury and two additional 'medicines', and 30 chapters on processes using mercury and three additional 'medicines'. All of these are preceded by an introduction describing the laboratory equipment mentioned in the treatise.\nThe Twenty Books (al-Kutub al-\u02bfishr\u016bn, Kr. nos. 213\u2013232): Only one treatise (The Book of the Crystal, Kit\u0101b al-Billawra, Kr. no. 220) and a long extract from another one (The Book of the Inner Consciousness, Kit\u0101b al-\u1e0cam\u012br, Kr. no. 230) survive. The Book of the Inner Consciousness appears to deal with the subject of specific properties (khaw\u0101\u1e63\u1e63) and with talismans (\u1e6dilasm\u0101t).\nThe Seventeen Books (Kr. nos. 233\u2013249); three treatises added to the Seventeen Books (Kr. nos. 250\u2013252); thirty unnamed books (Kr. nos. 253\u2013282); The Four Treatises and some related treatises (Kr. nos. 283\u2013286, 287\u2013292); The Ten Books According to the Opinion of Bal\u012bn\u0101s, the Master of Talismans (Kr. nos. 293\u2013302): Of these, only three treatises appear to be extant, i.e., the Kit\u0101b al-Maw\u0101z\u012bn (Kr. no. 242), the Kit\u0101b al-Istiq\u1e63\u0101\u02be (Kr. no. 248), and the Kit\u0101b al-K\u0101mil (Kr. no. 291).\nThe Books of the Balances (Kutub al-Maw\u0101z\u012bn, Kr. nos. 303\u2013446): This collection appears to have consisted of 144 treatises of medium length, 79 of which are known by name and 44 of which are still extant. Though relatively independent from each other and devoted to a very wide range of topics (cosmology, grammar, music theory, medicine, logic, metaphysics, mathematics, astronomy, astrology, etc.), they all approach their subject matter from the perspective of \"the science of the balance\" (\u02bfilm al-m\u012bz\u0101n, a theory which aims at reducing all phenomena to a system of measures and quantitative proportions). The Books of the Balances are also an important source for Jabir's speculations regarding the apparition of the \"two brothers\" (al-akhaw\u0101n), a doctrine which was later to become of great significance to the Egyptian alchemist Ibn Umayl (c. 900\u2013960).\nThe Five Hundred Books (al-Kutub al-Khamsumi\u02bea, Kr. nos. 447\u2013946): Only 29 treatises in this collection are known by name, 15 of which are extant. Its contents appear to have been mainly religious in nature, with moral exhortations and alchemical allegories occupying an important place. Among the extant treatises, The Book of the Glorious (Kit\u0101b al-M\u0101jid, Kr. no. 706) and The Book of Explication (Kit\u0101b al-Bay\u0101n, Kr. no. 785) are notable for containing some of the earliest preserved Shi'ite eschatological, soteriological and imamological doctrines. Intermittent extracts from The Book of Kingship (Kit\u0101b al-Mulk, Kr. no. 454) exist in a Latin translation under the title Liber regni.\nThe Books on the Seven Metals (Kr. nos. 947\u2013956): Seven treatises which are closely related to The Books of the Balances, each one dealing with one of Jabir's seven metals (respectively gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, lead, and kh\u0101r\u1e63\u012bn\u012b or \"chinese metal\"). In one manuscript, these are followed by the related three-part Book of Concision (Kit\u0101b al-\u012aj\u0101z, Kr. nos. 954\u2013956).\nDiverse alchemical treatises (Kr. nos. 957\u20131149): In this category, Kraus placed a large number of named treatises which he could not with any confidence attribute to one of the alchemical collections of the corpus. According to Kraus, some of them may actually have been part of The Five Hundred Books.\n\n\n=== Writings on magic (talismans, specific properties) ===\nAmong the surviving Jabirian treatises, there are also a number of relatively independent treatises dealing with \"the science of talismans\" (\u02bfilm al-\u1e6dilasm\u0101t, a form of theurgy) and with \"the science of specific properties\" (\u02bfilm al-khaw\u0101\u1e63\u1e63, i.e., the science dealing with the hidden powers of mineral, vegetable and animal substances, and with their practical applications in medical and various other pursuits). These are:\n\nThe Book of the Search (Kit\u0101b al-Ba\u1e25th, also known as The Book of Extracts, Kit\u0101b al-Nukhab, Kr. no. 1800): This long work deals with the philosophical foundations of theurgy or \"the science of talismans\" (\u02bfilm al-\u1e6dilasm\u0101t). It is also notable for citing a significant number of Greek authors: there are references to (the works of) Plato, Aristotle, Archimedes, Galen, Alexander of Aphrodisias, Porphyry, Themistius, (pseudo-)Apollonius of Tyana, and others.\nThe Book of Fifty (Kit\u0101b al-Khams\u012bn, perhaps identical to The Great Book on Talismans, Kit\u0101b al-\u1e6cilasm\u0101t al-kab\u012br, Kr. nos. 1825\u20131874): This work, only extracts of which are extant, deals with subjects such as the theoretical basis of theurgy, specific properties, astrology, and demonology.\nThe Great Book on Specific Properties (Kit\u0101b al-Khaw\u0101\u1e63\u1e63 al-kab\u012br, Kr. nos. 1900\u20131970): This is Jabir's main work on \"the science of specific properties\" (\u02bfilm al-khaw\u0101\u1e63\u1e63), i.e., the science dealing with the hidden powers of mineral, vegetable and animal substances, and with their practical applications in medical and various other pursuits. However, it also contains a number of chapters on \"the science of the balance\" (\u02bfilm al-m\u012bz\u0101n, a theory which aims at reducing all phenomena to a system of measures and quantitative proportions).\nThe Book of the King (Kit\u0101b al-Malik, kr. no. 1985): Short treatise on the effectiveness of talismans.\nThe Book of Black Magic (Kit\u0101b al-Jafr al-aswad, Kr. no. 1996): This treatise is not mentioned in any other Jabirian work.\n\n\n=== Other extant writings ===\nWritings on a wide variety of other topics were also attributed to Jabir. Most of these are lost (see below), except for:\n\nThe Book on Poisons and on the Repelling of their Harmful Effects (Kit\u0101b al-Sum\u016bm wa-daf\u02bf ma\u1e0d\u0101rrih\u0101, Kr. no. 2145): on pharmacology.\nThe Book of Comprehensiveness (Kit\u0101b al-Ishtim\u0101l, Kr. no. 2715): a long extract of this philosophical treatise is preserved by the poet and alchemist al-\u1e6cughr\u0101\u02be\u012b (1061\u2013c. 1121).\n\n\n=== Lost writings ===\nAlthough a significant number of the Jabirian treatises on alchemy and magic do survive, many of them are also lost. Apart from two surviving treatises (see immediately above), Jabir's many writings on other topics are all lost:\n\nCatalogues (Kr. nos. 1\u20134): There are three catalogues which Jabir is said to have written of his own works (Kr. nos. 1\u20133), and one Book on the Order of Reading our Books (Kit\u0101b Tart\u012bb qir\u0101\u02beat kutubin\u0101, Kr. no. 4). They are all lost.\nThe Books on Stratagems (Kutub al-\u1e24iyal, Kr. nos. 1150\u20131449) and The Books on Military Stratagems and Tricks (Kutub al-\u1e24iyal al-\u1e25ur\u016bbiyya wa-l-mak\u0101yid, Kr. nos. 1450\u20131749): Two large collections on 'mechanical tricks' (the Arabic word \u1e25iyal translates Greek \u03bc\u03b7\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03af, m\u0113chanai) and military engineering, both lost.\nMedical and pharmacological writings (Kr. nos. 2000\u20132499): Seven treatises are known by name, the only one extant being The Book on Poisons and on the Repelling of their Harmful Effects (Kit\u0101b al-Sum\u016bm wa-daf\u02bf ma\u1e0d\u0101rrih\u0101, Kr. no. 2145). Kraus also included into this category a lost treatise on zoology (The Book of Animals, Kit\u0101b al-\u1e24ayaw\u0101n, Kr. no. 2458) and a lost treatise on botany (The Book of Plants or The Book of Herbs, Kit\u0101b al-Nab\u0101t or Kit\u0101b al-\u1e24ash\u0101\u02beish, Kr. no. 2459).\nPhilosophical writings (Kutub al-falsafa, Kr. nos. 2500\u20132799): Under this heading, Kraus mentioned 23 works, most of which appear to deal with Aristotelian philosophy (titles include, e.g., The Books of Logic According to the Opinion of Aristotle, Kr. no. 2580; The Book of Categories, Kr. no. 2582; The Book on Interpretation, Kr. no. 2583; The Book of Metaphysics, Kr. no. 2681; The Book of the Refutation of Aristotle in his Book On the Soul, Kr. no. 2734). Of one treatise (The Book of Comprehensiveness, Kit\u0101b al-Ishtim\u0101l, Kr. no. 2715) a long extract is preserved by the poet and alchemist al-\u1e6cughr\u0101\u02be\u012b (1061\u2013c. 1121), but all other treatises in this group are lost.\nMathematical, astronomical and astrological writings (Kr. nos. 2800\u20132899): Thirteen treatises in this category are known by name, all of which are lost. Notable titles include a Book of Commentary on Euclid (Kit\u0101b Shar\u1e25 Uql\u012bdiyas, Kr. no. 2813), a Commentary on the Book of the Weight of the Crown by Archimedes (Shar\u1e25 kit\u0101b wazn al-t\u0101j li-Arsham\u012bdas, Kr. no. 2821), a Book of Commentary on the Almagest (Kit\u0101b Shar\u1e25 al-Majis\u1e6d\u012b, Kr. no. 2834), a Subtle Book on Astronomical Tables (Kit\u0101b al-Z\u0101j al-la\u1e6d\u012bf, Kr. no. 2839), a Compendium on the Astrolabe from a Theoretical and Practical Point of View (Kit\u0101b al-j\u0101mi\u02bf f\u012b l-as\u1e6durl\u0101b \u02bfilman wa-\u02bfamalan, Kr. no. 2845), and a Book of the Explanation of the Figures of the Zodiac and Their Activities (Kit\u0101b Shar\u1e25 \u1e63uwar al-bur\u016bj wa-af\u02bf\u0101lih\u0101, Kr. no. 2856).\nReligious writings (Kr. nos. 2900\u20133000): Apart from those known to belong to The Five Hundred Books (see above), there are a number of religious treatises whose exact place in the corpus is uncertain, all of which are lost. Notable titles include Books on the Shi'ite Schools of Thought (Kutub f\u012b madh\u0101hib al-sh\u012b\u02bfa, Kr. no. 2914), Our Books on the Transmigration of the Soul (Kutubun\u0101 f\u012b l-tan\u0101sukh, Kr. no. 2947), The Book of the Imamate (Kit\u0101b al-Im\u0101ma, Kr. no. 2958), and The Book in Which I Explained the Torah (Kit\u0101b\u012b alladh\u012b fassartu f\u012bhi al-tawr\u0101t, Kr. no. 2982).\n\n\n== Historical background ==\n\n\n=== Greco-Egyptian, Byzantine and Persian alchemy ===\n\nThe Jabirian writings contain a number of references to Greco-Egyptian alchemists such as pseudo-Democritus (fl. c. 60), Mary the Jewess (fl. c. 0\u2013300), Agathodaemon (fl. c. 300), and Zosimos of Panopolis (fl. c. 300), as well as to legendary figures such as Hermes Trismegistus and Ostanes, and to scriptural figures such as Moses and Jesus (to whom a number of alchemical writings were also ascribed). However, these references may have been meant as an appeal to ancient authority rather than as an acknowledgement of any intellectual borrowing, and in any case Jabirian alchemy was very different from what is found in the extant Greek alchemical treatises: it was much more systematic and coherent, it made much less use of allegory and symbols, and a much more important place was occupied by philosophical speculations and their application to laboratory experiments. Furthermore, whereas Greek alchemical texts had been almost exclusively focused on the use of mineral substances (i.e., on 'inorganic chemistry'), Jabirian alchemy pioneered the use of vegetable and animal substances, and so represented an innovative shift towards 'organic chemistry'.Nevertheless, there are some important theoretical similarities between Jabirian alchemy and contemporary Byzantine alchemy, and even though the Jabirian authors do not seem to have known Byzantine works that are extant today such as the alchemical works attributed to the Neoplatonic philosophers Olympiodorus (c. 495\u2013570) and Stephanus of Alexandria (fl. c. 580\u2013640), it seems that they were at least partly drawing on a parallel tradition of theoretical and philosophical alchemy. In any case, the writings actually used by the Jabirian authors appear to have mainly consisted of alchemical works falsely attributed to ancient philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Apollonius of Tyana, only some of which are still extant today, and whose philosophical content still needs to be determined.One of the innovations in Jabirian alchemy was the addition of sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride) to the category of chemical substances known as 'spirits' (i.e., strongly volatile substances). This included both naturally occurring sal ammoniac and synthetic ammonium chloride as produced from organic substances, and so the addition of sal ammoniac to the list of 'spirits' is likely a product of the new focus on organic chemistry. Since the word for sal ammoniac used in the Jabirian corpus (n\u016bsh\u0101dhir) is Iranian in origin, it has been suggested that the direct precursors of Jabirian alchemy may have been active in the Hellenizing and Syriacizing schools of the Sassanid Empire.\n\n\n== Chemical philosophy ==\n\n\n=== Elements and natures ===\nBy Jabir's time Aristotelian physics had become Neoplatonic. Each Aristotelian element was composed of these qualities: fire was both hot and dry, earth, cold and dry, water cold and moist, and air, hot and moist. In the Jabirian corpus, these qualities came to be called \"natures\" (\u1e6dab\u0101\u02bei\u02bf), and elements are said to be composed of these 'natures', plus an underlying \"substance\" (jawhar). In metals two of these 'natures' were interior and two were exterior. For example, lead was cold and dry and gold was hot and moist. Thus, Jabir theorized, by rearranging the natures of one metal, a different metal would result. Like Zosimos, Jabir believed this would require a catalyst, an al-iksir, the elusive elixir that would make this transformation possible \u2013 which in European alchemy became known as the philosopher's stone.\n\n\n=== The sulfur-mercury theory of metals ===\nThe sulfur-mercury theory of metals, though first attested in pseudo-Apollonius of Tyana's The Secret of Creation (Sirr al-khal\u012bqa, late 8th or early 9th century, but largely based on older sources), was also adopted by the Jabirian authors. According to the Jabirian version of this theory, metals form in the earth through the mixing of sulfur and mercury. Depending on the quality of the sulfur, different metals are formed, with gold being formed by the most subtle and well-balanced sulfur. This theory, which is ultimately based on ancient meteorological speculations such as those found in Aristotle's Meteorology, has formed the basis of all theories of metallic composition until the 18th century.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n\n=== English translations of Arabic Jabirian texts ===\nNomanul Haq, Syed (1994).

The works that survive today mainly deal with alchemy and chemistry, magic, and Shi'ite religious philosophy. However, the original scope of the corpus was vast and diverse, covering a wide range of topics ranging from cosmology, astronomy and astrology, over medicine, pharmacology, zoology and botany, to metaphysics, logic, and grammar.\nJabir's works contain the oldest known systematic classification of chemical substances, and the oldest known instructions for deriving an inorganic compound (sal ammoniac or ammonium chloride) from organic substances (such as plants, blood, and hair) by chemical means. His works also contain one of the earliest known versions of the sulfur-mercury theory of metals, a mineralogical theory that would remain dominant until the 18th century.\nA significant part of Jabir's writings were informed by a philosophical theory known as \"the science of the balance\" (Arabic: \u02bfilm al-m\u012bz\u0101n), which was aimed at reducing all phenomena (including material substances and their elements) to a system of measures and quantitative proportions. The Jabirian works also contain some of the earliest preserved Shi'ite eschatological, soteriological and imamological doctrines, which Jabir presented as deriving from his purported master, the Shi'ite Imam Ja\u02bffar al-\u1e62\u0101diq.\nAs early as the 10th century, the identity and exact corpus of works of Jabir was in dispute in Islamic scholarly circles. The authorship of all these works by a single figure, and even the existence of a historical Jabir, are also doubted by modern scholars. Instead, Jabir ibn Hayyan is thought to have been a pseudonym used by an anonymous school of Shi'ite alchemists writing in the late 9th and early 10th centuries.\nSome Arabic Jabirian works (e.g., The Great Book of Mercy, and The Book of Seventy) were translated into Latin under the Latinized name \"Geber\", and in 13th-century Europe an anonymous writer, usually referred to as pseudo-Geber, started to produce alchemical and metallurgical writings under this name."}, "Omphalomancy": {"links": ["Oracle bone", "Navel", "Palmistry", "Cartomancy", "Augury", "Sortes ", "Anthropomancy", "Astragalomancy", "Omen", "Astrology", "Ornithomancy", "Scrying", "Tarot card reading", "Fortune-telling", "Rhapsodomancy", "Rumpology", "Bibliomancy", "Molybdomancy", "Apophenia", "Sortes Sanctorum", "Tasseography", "Catoptromancy", "Myomancy", "Runic magic", "Prophecy", "Methods of divination", "Scapulimancy", "Cephalonomancy", "Alectryomancy", "Ailuromancy", "Crystal gazing", "Sortes Homericae", "Oculomancy", "Divination", "Belomancy", "Geomancy", "Oracle", "If\u00e1", "Podomancy", "Sortes Vergilianae", "Opele", "Favomancy", "Haruspex", "Cowrie-shell divination", "I Ching divination", "Kumalak", "Myrmomancy", "Ventriloquism", "Aspidomancy", "Hydromancy", "Obi divination", "Rhabdomancy", "Mengdu", "Necromancy", "Opon If\u00e1", "Taghairm", "Technomancy", "Cleromancy"], "content": "Omphalomancy is a method of divination meant to determine how many children a mother may have during her lifetime, based on the belief that the shape of the navel can reveal this information.
