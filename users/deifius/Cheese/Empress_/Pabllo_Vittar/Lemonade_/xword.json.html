Phabullo spent part of his childhood and adolescence living in the cities of Santa In\u00eas and Caxias, both in the interior of Maranh\u00e3o, due to financial difficulties. He never knew his father, who abandoned his mother, a nurse, when she was pregnant with him.During his childhood, Phabullo experienced bullying because of his delicate gestures and feminine voice. He was physically assaulted with a plate of hot soup thrown over his face. He attended ballet classes during this period.At the age of 13, Phabullo began doing covers at family parties and school performances and joined a choir at a Catholic church. Soon after, he began songwriting. Later, he decided to become a professional, moving to S\u00e3o Paulo with his sister, where he worked in several places, such as snack bars and beauty salons. Soon after, he moved to Uberl\u00e2ndia with his mother, who had recently married. At the age of 15, he came out to his mother, who had suspected that he was gay; his sister already knew about his sexual orientation. His mother, whom he talks to daily, is supportive of his sexual orientation.\n\nHe then began to go out for the night in Maranh\u00e3o, to make friends, and to participate as one of a selection of singers in a house of shows. He started performing his own songs and impersonating celebrities for a small fee, but it was not a professional job. He was now dressing feminine, but did not identify himself as a drag queen; the first time that he did drag was at age 17 in Uberl\u00e2ndia, to publicize a party of his friend by delivering pamphlets at the door of a nightclub. With time, he started performing in LGBT parades in diverse cities of Maranh\u00e3o and became known by the state's LGBT community. At age 18, in Minas Gerais, Phabullo started participating in and winning some beauty contests in full drag, before beginning his professional career as a singer while adopting the stage name of \"Pabllo Knowles\", an homage to singer Beyonc\u00e9. His first performance as a drag queen occurred at the Belgrano nightclub, of producers Ian Hayashi and Leoc\u00e1dio Rezende (whom Phabullo would later call his \"parents\").Still in Minas Gerais, Phabullo took a university entrance exam by the Federal University of Uberl\u00e2ndia, where he was admitted to the full design course in 2013, but after some periods he dropped out of college due to his schedule of shows, which increased greatly due to the success of his music videos on the internet and his participation in the band of primetime television program Amor & Sexo.When he attracted attention from entrepreneurs in the entertainment field, Phabullo began his musical career professionally, performing in bars and concert halls in Uberl\u00e2ndia and cities of the region. In this period, Phabullo adopted the stage name of Pabllo Vittar.On April 23, 2021, Vittar announced he is engaged via Instagram.\n\n\n== Artistry ==\n\n\n=== Musical and vocal style ===\nVittar is mainly a pop singer, although his music incorporates other genres. His debut studio album Vai Passar Mal mixes pop with elements of electronic music and Brazilian genres such as tecnomelody, arrocha, funk carioca, and forr\u00f3. Music critics noted that his second studio album N\u00e3o Para N\u00e3o follows a similar formula, mixing Brazilian and international influences. Speaking about the latter album, Vittar explained: \"I lived in Santa Izabel do Par\u00e1 and listened to cumbia, carimb\u00f3, tecnobrega and guitarrada. In Maranh\u00e3o, I heard ax\u00e9 and Bahia pagode. Pabllo Vittar is all over this album, I cannot go against my origins.\" His lyrics often explore themes such as love, self-confidence, and partying.Vittar is a countertenor with 2.3 octaves of vocal extension already exhibited, spanning from flat E in the third octave (E\u266d3) to G# in the fifth octave (G\u266f5). S\u00e9rgio Anders, a singing professor at the State University of Minas Gerais, considers Vittar to have \"an infantile voice in an adult male\". While he views Vittar as a good singer, Anders opines that his technique is not very developed. Shannon Sims of The New York Times described Vittar's voice as a \"nasal soprano\".\n\n\n=== Influences ===\n\nVittar grew up listening to artists such as Aretha Franklin, Donna Summer, Whitney Houston, and Tina Turner, whom he imitated as a child before he even considered becoming a drag queen, as well as Gilberto Gil, Ney Matogrosso, Elis Regina, Alcione Nazareth, and Caetano Veloso. He became interested in drag after watching the reality show RuPaul's Drag Race and cited RuPaul as an important inspiration: \"All the drag artists in this world have to thank RuPaul for the visibility we have today.\" Some participants of the show have also influenced Vittar, notably April Carrion and Naomi Smalls. Model Bella Hadid visually influences him, especially his makeup and style. His music and performances are greatly influenced by bands such as Banda Batid\u00e3o and Companhia do Calypso.Early in his career, he used the stage name Pabllo Knowles as a reference to Beyonc\u00e9. Other influences include Rihanna, Kanye West, Lady Gaga, and Britney Spears, as well as his \"Sua Cara\" collaborators Anitta and Major Lazer. While making his debut album Vai Passar Mal, Vittar explained that he listened to several artists to find inspiration, citing Liniker and Elza Soares as examples. The album was also influenced by Lana Del Rey, Allie X, Rihanna's album Anti, and Beyonc\u00e9's album Lemonade.\n\n\n== Public image and impact ==\n Vittar's music is considered as \"unofficial anthems for Brazil's lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community\" and he is widely viewed as a voice for them. Because dangers to LGBT+ people have grown in Brazil, Vittar's openness about being gay has made him an icon to those living in a prejudiced environment. As an openly gay Brazilian drag queen, Vittar has served as a positive representation of homosexuality and gender fluidity. He used his visibility to support LGBT+ individuals in Brazil and in other countries in South America. He said: \"They tell me a lot about their daily struggle to go out on the street being gay, being drag. I want to give them strength so they can continue being who they are.\" Vittar also appeared on A For\u00e7a do Querer (\"Edge of Desire\"), a popular soap opera about a transgender man. After seeing Vittar perform at the Rock in Rio festival, actor F\u00e1bio Assun\u00e7\u00e3o wrote in a Facebook post: \"You represent the possibility of truth in a sea of hypocrisy. Your public figure is the voice of many suffocated people.\"In an interview for Veja magazine, Vittar revealed that he chose a masculine stage name because he wanted to be truthful to the public, since he is not transgender. He only acts as a woman when he's on stage as Pabllo Vittar and has a more typical masculine gender expression in his private life. During the same interview, Vittar said he is \"making music for humans.\" Since his debut, Vittar became the most followed and most streamed drag queen in the world, surpassing RuPaul. In 2020, Vittar was featured in a campaign for Calvin Klein, as part of the designer's pride collection.\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\nVai Passar Mal (2017)\nN\u00e3o Para N\u00e3o (2018)\n111 (2020)\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n\n=== Film ===\n\n\n=== Television ===\n\n\n== Tours ==\nOpen Bar Tour (2015\u20132016)\nVai Passar Mal Tour (2017\u20132018)\nN\u00e3o Para N\u00e3o Tour (2018\u20132019)\n111 Tour (2021)\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPabllo Vittar on Facebook\nPabllo Vittar at IMDb\nPabllo Vittar on Dicion\u00e1rio Cravo Albin da M\u00fasica Popular Brasileira (in Portuguese)", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Audio-input-microphone.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Beyonc%C3%A9_at_The_Lion_King_European_Premiere_2019.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Conga.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/Nuvola_LGBT_flag.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ab/Pabllo_Vittar_in_2021_02.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/RuPaul_by_David_Shankbone_cropped.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/05/Flag_of_Brazil.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/69/P_vip.svg"], "summary": "Phabullo Rodrigues da Silva (born November 1, 1993), known professionally as Pabllo Vittar (Portuguese pronunciation: [\u02c8pablu vi\u02c8ta\u027e]) is a Brazilian drag queen, singer and songwriter.
