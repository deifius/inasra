"Camp Pine Knot, also known as Huntington Memorial Camp, on Raquette Lake in the Adirondack Mountains of New York State, was built by William West Durant. Begun in 1877, it was the first of the \"Adirondack Great Camps\" and epitomizes the \"Great Camp\" architectural style.  Elements of that style include log and native stonework construction, decorative rustic items of branches and twigs, and layout as a compound of separated structures.   It is located on the southwest tip of Long Point, a two-mile long point extending into Raquette Lake, in the Town of Long Lake in Hamilton County, New York.\nThe camp consists of some two dozen buildings, including a seven-room  \"Swiss Cottage,\" four \"Log Cottages\" of one to three rooms, two frame cottages of three and five rooms, a \"Glass Dining Room,\" and a five-stall horse barn and wagon shed.  Covered walkways connect many of the buildings.  There was also the \"Barque,\" a 20 by 60 foot four-room bark cabin built on a log raft, used to escape from the dreaded black fly in the spring; it was fully equipped, with a kitchen, bath, and running water."
