"An English muffin is a small, round, flat yeast-leavened bread which is commonly sliced horizontally, toasted, and buttered. It is often part of breakfast in North America and Australia, frequently eaten with sweet or savory toppings such as fruit jam or honey, or eggs, sausage, bacon, or cheese.  English muffins are an essential ingredient in Eggs Benedict and a variety of breakfast sandwiches derived from it, such as the McMuffin.\nIn North America and North American-influenced territories, they are called English muffins to distinguish them from plain muffins, which are larger and sweeter miniature quick breads. English muffins are available in a wide range of varieties, including whole wheat, multigrain, cinnamon raisin, cranberry, and apple cinnamon.\nEnglish muffins are very similar to bolo do caco in Portuguese cuisine.  \n\n"
