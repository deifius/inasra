He is the central figure of Christianity, the world's largest religion. Most Christians believe he is the incarnation of God the Son and the awaited messiah (the Christ), prophesied in the Old Testament.Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has yielded some uncertainty on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the Jesus portrayed in the Bible reflects the historical Jesus, as the only records of Jesus' life are contained in the Gospels. Jesus was a Galilean Jew, who was baptized by John the Baptist and began his own ministry. His teachings were initially conserved by oral transmission and he himself was often referred to as \"rabbi\". Jesus debated with fellow Jews on how to best follow God, engaged in healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. Tradition holds that he was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, turned over to the Roman government, and crucified on the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the early Church.Christian doctrines include the beliefs that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit, was born of a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Christian Church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement for sin, rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, from where he will return. Commonly, Christians believe Jesus enables people to be reconciled to God. The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge the living and the dead either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology. The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of the Trinity. A small minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural. The birth of Jesus is celebrated annually on December 25 as Christmas. His crucifixion is honored on Good Friday and his resurrection on Easter Sunday. The widely used calendar era \"AD\", from the Latin anno Domini (\"year of the Lord\"), and the equivalent alternative \"CE\", are based on the approximate birthdate of Jesus.Jesus is also revered outside of Christianity in religions such as Islam, Manicheanism and Baha'i. Manicheanism was the first organised religion outside of Christianity to venerate Jesus, viewing him as an important prophet. In Islam, Jesus (often referred to by his Quranic name \u02bf\u012as\u0101) is considered one of God's important prophets and the messiah. Muslims believe Jesus was born of a virgin, but was neither God nor a son of God. The Quran states that Jesus never claimed divinity. Most Muslims do not believe that he was killed or crucified, but that God raised him into Heaven while he was still alive. In contrast, Judaism rejects the belief that Jesus was the awaited messiah, arguing that he did not fulfill messianic prophecies, and was neither divine nor resurrected.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nA typical Jew in Jesus' time had only one name, sometimes followed by the phrase \"son of [father's name]\", or the individual's hometown. Thus, in the New Testament, Jesus is commonly referred to as \"Jesus of Nazareth.\" Jesus' neighbors in Nazareth refer to him as \"the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon\", \"the carpenter's son,\" or \"Joseph's son\". In the Gospel of John, the disciple Philip refers to him as \"Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth\".The English name Jesus is derived from the Latin Iesus, itself a transliteration of the Greek \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2 (I\u0113so\u00fbs). The Greek form is probably a rendering of the Hebrew and Aramaic name \u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05e2\u200e (Y\u0113\u0161\u00fba\u02bf), a shorter variant of the earlier Hebrew name \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05e9\u05e2\u200e (Y\u0259h\u00f4\u0161\u00fba\u02bf, English: \"Joshua\"). The name Y\u0259h\u00f4\u0161\u00fba\u02bf likely means \"Yah saves\". This was also the name of Moses' successor and of a Jewish high priest in the Hebrew Bible, both of whom are represented in the Septuagint (a Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible) as I\u0113so\u00fbs.\nThe name Yeshua appears to have been in use in Judea at the time of the birth of Jesus. The 1st-century works of historian Flavius Josephus, who wrote in Koine Greek, the same language as that of the New Testament, refer to at least twenty different people with the name Jesus (i.e. \u1f38\u03b7\u03c3\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2). The etymology of Jesus' name in the context of the New Testament is generally given as \"Yahweh is salvation\".Since the early period of Christianity, Christians have commonly referred to Jesus as \"Jesus Christ\". \"Jesus Christ\" is the name that the author of the Gospel of John claims Jesus gave to himself during his high priestly prayer. The word Christ was a title or office (\"the Christ\"), not a given name. It derives from the Greek \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 (Christos), a translation of the Hebrew mashiakh (\u05de\u05e9\u05d9\u05d7) meaning \"anointed\", and is usually transliterated into English as \"messiah\". In biblical Judaism, sacred oil was used to anoint certain exceptionally holy people and objects as part of their religious investiture.Christians of the time designated Jesus as \"the Christ\" because they believed him to be the messiah, whose arrival is prophesied in the Hebrew Bible and Old Testament. In postbiblical usage, Christ became viewed as a name\u2014one part of \"Jesus Christ\". The term Christian (meaning a follower of Christ) has been in use since the 1st century.\n\n\n== Life and teachings in the New Testament ==\n\n\n=== Canonical gospels ===\nThe four canonical gospels (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John) are the foremost sources for the life and message of Jesus. But other parts of the New Testament also include references to key episodes in his life, such as the Last Supper in 1 Corinthians 11:23-26. Acts of the Apostles refers to Jesus' early ministry and its anticipation by John the Baptist. Acts 1:1-11 says more about the Ascension of Jesus than the canonical gospels do. In the undisputed Pauline letters, which were written earlier than the Gospels, Jesus' words or instructions are cited several times.Some early Christian groups had separate descriptions of Jesus' life and teachings that are not in the New Testament. These include the Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Peter, and Gospel of Judas, the Apocryphon of James, and many other apocryphal writings. Most scholars conclude that these were written much later and are less reliable accounts than the canonical gospels.The canonical gospels are four accounts, each by a different author. The authors of the Gospels are all anonymous, attributed by tradition to the four evangelists, each with close ties to Jesus: Mark by John Mark, an associate of Peter; Matthew by one of Jesus' disciples; Luke by a companion of Paul mentioned in a few epistles; and John by another of Jesus' disciples, the \"beloved disciple\".One important aspect of the study of the Gospels is the literary genre under which they fall. Genre \"is a key convention guiding both the composition and the interpretation of writings\". Whether the gospel authors set out to write novels, myths, histories, or biographies has a tremendous impact on how they ought to be interpreted. Some recent studies suggest that the genre of the Gospels ought to be situated within the realm of ancient biography. Although not without critics, the position that the Gospels are a type of ancient biography is the consensus among scholars today.Concerning the accuracy of the accounts, viewpoints run the gamut from considering them inerrant descriptions of Jesus' life, to doubting whether they are historically reliable on a number of points, to considering them to provide very little historical information about his life beyond the basics. According to a broad scholarly consensus, the Synoptic Gospels (the first three\u2014Matthew, Mark, and Luke) are the most reliable sources of information about Jesus.According to the Marcan priority, the first to be written was the Gospel of Mark (written AD 60\u201375), followed by the Gospel of Matthew (AD 65\u201385), the Gospel of Luke (AD 65\u201395), and the Gospel of John (AD 75\u2013100). Most scholars agree that the authors of Matthew and Luke used Mark as a source for their gospels. Since Matthew and Luke also share some content not found in Mark, many scholars assume that they used another source (commonly called the \"Q source\") in addition to Mark.Matthew, Mark, and Luke are known as the Synoptic Gospels, from the Greek \u03c3\u03cd\u03bd (syn \"together\") and \u1f44\u03c8\u03b9\u03c2 (opsis \"view\"), because they are similar in content, narrative arrangement, language and paragraph structure, and one can easily set them next to each other and synoptically compare what is in them. Scholars generally agree that it is impossible to find any direct literary relationship between the Synoptic Gospels and the Gospel of John. While the flow of some events (such as Jesus' baptism, transfiguration, crucifixion and interactions with the apostles) are shared among the Synoptic Gospels, incidents such as the transfiguration do not appear in John, which also differs on other matters, such as the Cleansing of the Temple.\nThe Synoptics emphasize different aspects of Jesus. In Mark, Jesus is the Son of God whose mighty works demonstrate the presence of God's Kingdom. He is a tireless wonder worker, the servant of both God and man. This short gospel records few of Jesus' words or teachings. The Gospel of Matthew emphasizes that Jesus is the fulfillment of God's will as revealed in the Old Testament, and the Lord of the Church. He is the \"Son of David\", a \"king\", and the messiah. Luke presents Jesus as the divine-human savior who shows compassion to the needy. He is the friend of sinners and outcasts, come to seek and save the lost. This gospel includes well-known parables, such as the Good Samaritan and the Prodigal Son.The prologue to the Gospel of John identifies Jesus as an incarnation of the divine Word (Logos). As the Word, Jesus was eternally present with God, active in all creation, and the source of humanity's moral and spiritual nature. Jesus is not only greater than any past human prophet but greater than any prophet could be. He not only speaks God's Word; he is God's Word. In the Gospel of John, Jesus reveals his divine role publicly. Here he is the Bread of Life, the Light of the World, the True Vine and more.In general, the authors of the New Testament showed little interest in an absolute chronology of Jesus or in synchronizing the episodes of his life with the secular history of the age. As stated in John 21:25, the Gospels do not claim to provide an exhaustive list of the events in Jesus' life. The accounts were primarily written as theological documents in the context of early Christianity, with timelines as a secondary consideration. In this respect, it is noteworthy that the Gospels devote about one third of their text to the last week of Jesus' life in Jerusalem, referred to as the Passion. The Gospels do not provide enough details to satisfy the demands of modern historians regarding exact dates, but it is possible to draw from them a general picture of Jesus' life story.\n\n\n=== Genealogy and nativity ===\n\nJesus was Jewish, born to Mary, wife of Joseph. The Gospels of Matthew and Luke offer two accounts of his genealogy. Matthew traces Jesus' ancestry to Abraham through David. Luke traces Jesus' ancestry through Adam to God. The lists are identical between Abraham and David, but differ radically from that point. Matthew has 27 generations from David to Joseph, whereas Luke has 42, with almost no overlap between the names on the two lists. Various theories have been put forward to explain why the two genealogies are so different.\n\nMatthew and Luke each describe Jesus' birth, especially that Jesus was born to a virgin named Mary in Bethlehem in fulfillment of prophecy. Luke's account emphasizes events before the birth of Jesus and centers on Mary, while Matthew's mostly covers those after the birth and centers on Joseph. Both accounts state that Jesus was born to Joseph and Mary, his betrothed, in Bethlehem, and both support the doctrine of the virgin birth of Jesus, according to which Jesus was miraculously conceived by the Holy Spirit in Mary's womb when she was still a virgin. At the same time, there is evidence, at least in the Lukan Acts of the Apostles, that Jesus was thought to have had, like many figures in antiquity, a dual paternity, since there it is stated he descended from the seed or loins of David. By taking him as his own, Joseph will give him the necessary Davidic descent.In Matthew, Joseph is troubled because Mary, his betrothed, is pregnant, but in the first of Joseph's three dreams an angel assures him not to be afraid to take Mary as his wife, because her child was conceived by the Holy Spirit. In Matthew 2:1\u201312, wise men or Magi from the East bring gifts to the young Jesus as the King of the Jews. They find him in a house in Bethlehem. Jesus is now a child and not an infant. Matthew focuses on an event after the Luke Nativity where Jesus was an infant. In Matthew Herod the Great hears of Jesus' birth and, wanting him killed, orders the murders of male infants in Bethlehem under age of 2. But an angel warns Joseph in his second dream, and the family flees to Egypt\u2014later to return and settle in Nazareth.In Luke 1:31-38, Mary learns from the angel Gabriel that she will conceive and bear a child called Jesus through the action of the Holy Spirit. When Mary is due to give birth, she and Joseph travel from Nazareth to Joseph's ancestral home in Bethlehem to register in the census ordered by Caesar Augustus. While there Mary gives birth to Jesus, and as they have found no room in the inn, she places the newborn in a manger. An angel announces the birth to a group of shepherds, who go to Bethlehem to see Jesus, and subsequently spread the news abroad. After the presentation of Jesus at the Temple, Joseph, Mary and Jesus return to Nazareth.\n\n\n=== Early life, family, and profession ===\n\nJesus' childhood home is identified in the Gospels of Luke and Matthew as the town of Nazareth in Galilee, where he lived with his family. Although Joseph appears in descriptions of Jesus' childhood, no mention is made of him thereafter. His other family members\u2014his mother, Mary, his brothers James, Joses (or Joseph), Judas and Simon and his unnamed sisters\u2014are mentioned in the Gospels and other sources.The Gospel of Mark reports that Jesus comes into conflict with his neighbors and family. Jesus' mother and brothers come to get him because people are saying that he is crazy. Jesus responds that his followers are his true family. In John, Mary follows Jesus to his crucifixion, and he expresses concern over her well-being.Jesus is called a \u03c4\u03ad\u03ba\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd (tekt\u014dn) in Mark 6:3, traditionally understood as carpenter but it could cover makers of objects in various materials, including builders. The Gospels indicate that Jesus could read, paraphrase, and debate scripture, but this does not necessarily mean that he received formal scribal training.When Jesus is presented as a baby in the temple per Jewish Law, a man named Simeon says to Mary and Joseph that Jesus \"shall stand as a sign of contradiction, while a sword will pierce your own soul. Then the secret thoughts of many will come to light.\" Several years later, when Jesus goes missing on a visit to Jerusalem, his parents find him in the temple sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking questions, and the people are amazed at his understanding and answers; Mary scolds Jesus for going missing, to which Jesus replies that he must \"be in his father's house.\"\n\n\n=== Baptism and temptation ===\n\nThe Synoptic accounts of Jesus' baptism are all preceded by information about John the Baptist. They show John preaching penance and repentance for the remission of sins and encouraging the giving of alms to the poor as he baptizes people in the area of the Jordan River around Perea and foretells the arrival of someone \"more powerful\" than he. Later, Jesus identifies John as \"the Elijah who was to come,\" the prophet who was expected to arrive before the \"great and terrible day of the Lord.\" Likewise, Luke says that John had the spirit and power of Elijah.In the Gospel of Mark, John the Baptist baptizes Jesus, and as he comes out of the water he sees the Holy Spirit descending to him like a dove and he hears a voice from heaven declaring him to be God's Son. This is one of two events described in the Gospels where a voice from Heaven calls Jesus \"Son\", the other being the Transfiguration. The spirit then drives him into the wilderness where he is tempted by Satan. Jesus then begins his ministry after John's arrest. Jesus' baptism in the Gospel of Matthew is similar. Here, before Jesus' baptism, John protests, saying, \"I need to be baptized by you.\" Jesus instructs him to carry on with the baptism \"to fulfill all righteousness.\" Matthew also details the three temptations that Satan offers Jesus in the wilderness. In the Gospel of Luke, the Holy Spirit descends as a dove after everyone has been baptized and Jesus is praying, John implicitly recognizes Jesus from prison after sending his followers to ask about him. Jesus' baptism and temptation serve as preparation for his public ministry.The Gospel of John leaves out Jesus' baptism and temptation. Here, John the Baptist testifies that he saw the Spirit descend on Jesus. John publicly proclaims Jesus as the sacrificial Lamb of God, and some of John's followers become disciples of Jesus. In this Gospel, John denies that he is Elijah. Before John is imprisoned, Jesus leads his followers to baptize disciples as well, and they baptize more people than John.\n\n\n=== Public ministry ===\n\nThe Synoptics depict two distinct geographical settings in Jesus' ministry. The first takes place north of Judea, in Galilee, where Jesus conducts a successful ministry, and the second shows Jesus rejected and killed when he travels to Jerusalem. Often referred to as \"rabbi\", Jesus preaches his message orally. Notably, Jesus forbids those who recognize him as the messiah to speak of it, including people he heals and demons he exorcises (see Messianic Secret).John depicts Jesus' ministry as largely taking place in and around Jerusalem, rather than in Galilee; and Jesus' divine identity is openly proclaimed and immediately recognized.Scholars divide the ministry of Jesus into several stages. The Galilean ministry begins when Jesus returns to Galilee from the Judaean Desert after rebuffing the temptation of Satan. Jesus preaches around Galilee, and in Matthew 4:18\u201320, his first disciples, who will eventually form the core of the early Church, encounter him and begin to travel with him. This period includes the Sermon on the Mount, one of Jesus' major discourses, as well as the calming of the storm, the feeding of the 5,000, walking on water and a number of other miracles and parables. It ends with the Confession of Peter and the Transfiguration.As Jesus travels towards Jerusalem, in the Perean ministry, he returns to the area where he was baptized, about a third of the way down from the Sea of Galilee along the Jordan River. The final ministry in Jerusalem begins with Jesus' triumphal entry into the city on Palm Sunday. In the Synoptic Gospels, during that week Jesus drives the money changers from the Second Temple and Judas bargains to betray him. This period culminates in the Last Supper and the Farewell Discourse.\n\n\n==== Disciples and followers ====\n\nNear the beginning of his ministry, Jesus appoints twelve apostles. In Matthew and Mark, despite Jesus only briefly requesting that they join him, Jesus' first four apostles, who were fishermen, are described as immediately consenting, and abandoning their nets and boats to do so. In John, Jesus' first two apostles were disciples of John the Baptist. The Baptist sees Jesus and calls him the Lamb of God; the two hear this and follow Jesus. In addition to the Twelve Apostles, the opening of the passage of the Sermon on the Plain identifies a much larger group of people as disciples. Also, in Luke 10:1\u201316 Jesus sends 70 or 72 of his followers in pairs to prepare towns for his prospective visit. They are instructed to accept hospitality, heal the sick and spread the word that the Kingdom of God is coming.In Mark, the disciples are notably obtuse. They fail to understand Jesus' miracles, his parables, or what \"rising from the dead\" means. When Jesus is later arrested, they desert him.\n\n\n==== Teachings and miracles ====\n\nIn the Synoptics, Jesus teaches extensively, often in parables, about the Kingdom of God (or, in Matthew, the Kingdom of Heaven). The Kingdom is described as both imminent and already present in the ministry of Jesus. Jesus promises inclusion in the Kingdom for those who accept his message. He talks of the \"Son of Man,\" an apocalyptic figure who will come to gather the chosen.Jesus calls people to repent their sins and to devote themselves completely to God. He tells his followers to adhere to Jewish law, although he is perceived by some to have broken the law himself, for example regarding the Sabbath. When asked what the greatest commandment is, Jesus replies: \"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind ... And a second is like it: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\" Other ethical teachings of Jesus include loving your enemies, refraining from hatred and lust, turning the other cheek, and forgiving people who have sinned against you.John's Gospel presents the teachings of Jesus not merely as his own preaching, but as divine revelation. John the Baptist, for example, states in John 3:34: \"He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure.\" In John 7:16 Jesus says, \"My teaching is not mine but his who sent me.\" He asserts the same thing in John 14:10: \"Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own; but the Father who dwells in me does his works.\"\n\nApproximately 30 parables form about one third of Jesus' recorded teachings. The parables appear within longer sermons and at other places in the narrative. They often contain symbolism, and usually relate the physical world to the spiritual. Common themes in these tales include the kindness and generosity of God and the perils of transgression. Some of his parables, such as the Prodigal Son, are relatively simple, while others, such as the Growing Seed, are sophisticated, profound and abstruse. When asked by his disciples why he speaks in parables to the people, Jesus replies that the chosen disciples have been given to \"know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven\", unlike the rest of their people, \"For the one who has will be given more and he will have in abundance. But the one who does not have will be deprived even more\", going on to say that the majority of their generation have grown \"dull hearts\" and thus are unable to understand.In the gospel accounts, Jesus devotes a large portion of his ministry performing miracles, especially healings. The miracles can be classified into two main categories: healing miracles and nature miracles. The healing miracles include cures for physical ailments, exorcisms, and resurrections of the dead. The nature miracles show Jesus' power over nature, and include turning water into wine, walking on water, and calming a storm, among others. Jesus states that his miracles are from a divine source. When his opponents suddenly accuse him of performing exorcisms by the power of Beelzebul, the prince of demons, Jesus counters that he performs them by the \"Spirit of God\" (Matthew 12:28) or \"finger of God\", arguing that all logic suggests that Satan would not let his demons assist the Children of God because it would divide Satan's house and bring his kingdom to desolation; furthermore, he asks his opponents that if he exorcises by Beel'zebub, \"by whom do your sons cast them out?\" In Matthew 12:31\u201332, he goes on to say that while all manner of sin, \"even insults against God\" or \"insults against the son of man\", shall be forgiven, whoever insults goodness (or \"The Holy Spirit\") shall never be forgiven; they carry the guilt of their sin forever.\nIn John, Jesus' miracles are described as \"signs\", performed to prove his mission and divinity. In the Synoptics, when asked by some teachers of the Law and some Pharisees to give miraculous signs to prove his authority, Jesus refuses, saying that no sign shall come to corrupt and evil people except the sign of the prophet Jonah. Also, in the Synoptic Gospels, the crowds regularly respond to Jesus' miracles with awe and press on him to heal their sick. In John's Gospel, Jesus is presented as unpressured by the crowds, who often respond to his miracles with trust and faith. One characteristic shared among all miracles of Jesus in the gospel accounts is that he performed them freely and never requested or accepted any form of payment. The gospel episodes that include descriptions of the miracles of Jesus also often include teachings, and the miracles themselves involve an element of teaching. Many of the miracles teach the importance of faith. In the cleansing of ten lepers and the raising of Jairus' daughter, for instance, the beneficiaries are told that their healing was due to their faith.\n\n\n==== Proclamation as Christ and Transfiguration ====\n\nAt about the middle of each of the three Synoptic Gospels are two significant events: the Confession of Peter and the Transfiguration of Jesus. These two events are not mentioned in the Gospel of John.In his Confession, Peter tells Jesus, \"You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.\" Jesus affirms that Peter's confession is divinely revealed truth. After the confession, Jesus tells his disciples about his upcoming death and resurrection.In the Transfiguration, Jesus takes Peter and two other apostles up an unnamed mountain, where \"he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became dazzling white.\" A bright cloud appears around them, and a voice from the cloud says, \"This is my Son, the Beloved; with him I am well pleased; listen to him.\"\n\n\n=== Passion Week ===\nThe description of the last week of the life of Jesus (often called Passion Week) occupies about one third of the narrative in the canonical gospels, starting with Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem and ending with his Crucifixion.\n\n\n==== Activities in Jerusalem ====\n\nIn the Synoptics, the last week in Jerusalem is the conclusion of the journey through Perea and Judea that Jesus began in Galilee. Jesus rides a young donkey into Jerusalem, reflecting the tale of the Messiah's Donkey, an oracle from the Book of Zechariah in which the Jews' humble king enters Jerusalem this way. People along the way lay cloaks and small branches of trees (known as palm fronds) in front of him and sing part of Psalms 118:25-26.Jesus next expels the money changers from the Second Temple, accusing them of turning it into a den of thieves through their commercial activities. He then prophesies about the coming destruction, including false prophets, wars, earthquakes, celestial disorders, persecution of the faithful, the appearance of an \"abomination of desolation,\" and unendurable tribulations. The mysterious \"Son of Man,\" he says, will dispatch angels to gather the faithful from all parts of the earth. Jesus warns that these wonders will occur in the lifetimes of the hearers. In John, the Cleansing of the Temple occurs at the beginning of Jesus' ministry instead of at the end.Jesus comes into conflict with the Jewish elders, such as when they question his authority and when he criticizes them and calls them hypocrites. Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve apostles, secretly strikes a bargain with the Jewish elders, agreeing to betray Jesus to them for 30 silver coins.The Gospel of John recounts of two other feasts in which Jesus taught in Jerusalem before the Passion Week. In Bethany, a village near Jerusalem, Jesus raises Lazarus from the dead. This potent sign increases the tension with authorities, who conspire to kill him. Mary of Bethany anoints Jesus' feet, foreshadowing his entombment. Jesus then makes his Messianic entry into Jerusalem.\nThe cheering crowds greeting Jesus as he enters Jerusalem add to the animosity between him and the establishment. In John, Jesus has already cleansed the Second Temple during an earlier Passover visit to Jerusalem. John next recounts Jesus' Last Supper with his disciples.\n\n\n==== Last Supper ====\n\nThe Last Supper is the final meal that Jesus shares with his twelve apostles in Jerusalem before his crucifixion. The Last Supper is mentioned in all four canonical gospels; Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians also refers to it. During the meal, Jesus predicts that one of his apostles will betray him. Despite each Apostle's assertion that he would not betray him, Jesus reiterates that the betrayer would be one of those present. Matthew 26:23\u201325 and John 13:26\u201327 specifically identify Judas as the traitor.In the Synoptics, Jesus takes bread, breaks it, and gives it to the disciples, saying, \"This is my body, which is given for you\". He then has them all drink from a cup, saying, \"This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood,\" The Christian sacrament or ordinance of the Eucharist is based on these events. Although the Gospel of John does not include a description of the bread-and-wine ritual during the Last Supper, most scholars agree that John 6:22\u201359 (the Bread of Life Discourse) has a eucharistic character and resonates with the institution narratives in the Synoptic Gospels and in the Pauline writings on the Last Supper.In all four gospels, Jesus predicts that Peter will deny knowledge of him three times before the rooster crows the next morning. In Luke and John, the prediction is made during the Supper. In Matthew and Mark, the prediction is made after the Supper; Jesus also predicts that all his disciples will desert him. The Gospel of John provides the only account of Jesus washing his disciples' feet after the meal. John also includes a long sermon by Jesus, preparing his disciples (now without Judas) for his departure. Chapters 14\u201317 of the Gospel of John are known as the Farewell Discourse and are a significant source of Christological content.\n\n\n==== Agony in the Garden, betrayal, and arrest ====\n\nIn the Synoptics, Jesus and his disciples go to the garden Gethsemane, where Jesus prays to be spared his coming ordeal. Then Judas comes with an armed mob, sent by the chief priests, scribes and elders. He kisses Jesus to identify him to the crowd, which then arrests Jesus. In an attempt to stop them, an unnamed disciple of Jesus uses a sword to cut off the ear of a man in the crowd. After Jesus' arrest, his disciples go into hiding, and Peter, when questioned, thrice denies knowing Jesus. After the third denial, Peter hears the rooster crow and recalls Jesus' prediction about his denial. Peter then weeps bitterly.In John 18:1\u201311, Jesus does not pray to be spared his crucifixion, as the gospel portrays him as scarcely touched by such human weakness. The people who arrest him are Roman soldiers and Temple guards. Instead of being betrayed by a kiss, Jesus proclaims his identity, and when he does, the soldiers and officers fall to the ground. The gospel identifies Peter as the disciple who used the sword, and Jesus rebukes him for it.\n\n\n==== Trials by the Sanhedrin, Herod, and Pilate ====\n\nAfter his arrest, Jesus is taken late at night to the private residence of the high priest, Caiaphas, who had been installed by Pilate's predecessor, the Roman procurator Valerius Gratus. The Sanhedrin was a Jewish judicial body, The gospel accounts differ on the details of the trials. In Matthew 26:57, Mark 14:53 and Luke 22:54, Jesus is taken to the house of the high priest, Caiaphas, where he is mocked and beaten that night. Early the next morning, the chief priests and scribes lead Jesus away into their council. John 18:12\u201314 states that Jesus is first taken to Annas, Caiaphas' father-in-law, and then to the high priest.\n\nDuring the trials Jesus speaks very little, mounts no defense, and gives very infrequent and indirect answers to the priests' questions, prompting an officer to slap him. In Matthew 26:62, Jesus' unresponsiveness leads Caiaphas to ask him, \"Have you no answer?\" In Mark 14:61 the high priest then asks Jesus, \"Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?\" Jesus replies, \"I am\", and then predicts the coming of the Son of Man. This provokes Caiaphas to tear his own robe in anger and to accuse Jesus of blasphemy. In Matthew and Luke, Jesus' answer is more ambiguous: in Matthew 26:64 he responds, \"You have said so\", and in Luke 22:70 he says, \"You say that I am\".The Jewish elders take Jesus to Pilate's Court and ask the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate, to judge and condemn Jesus for various allegations: subverting the nation, opposing the payment of tribute, claiming to be Christ, a King, and claiming to be the son of God. The use of the word \"king\" is central to the discussion between Jesus and Pilate. In John 18:36 Jesus states, \"My kingdom is not from this world\", but he does not unequivocally deny being the King of the Jews. In Luke 23:7\u201315, Pilate realizes that Jesus is a Galilean, and thus comes under the jurisdiction of Herod Antipas, the Tetrarch of Galilee and Perea. Pilate sends Jesus to Herod to be tried, but Jesus says almost nothing in response to Herod's questions. Herod and his soldiers mock Jesus, put an expensive robe on him to make him look like a king, and return him to Pilate, who then calls together the Jewish elders and announces that he has \"not found this man guilty\".Observing a Passover custom of the time, Pilate allows one prisoner chosen by the crowd to be released. He gives the people a choice between Jesus and a murderer called Barabbas (\u05d1\u05e8-\u05d0\u05d1\u05d0 or  Bar-abb\u00e2, \"son of the father\", from the common given name Abba: 'father'). Persuaded by the elders, the mob chooses to release Barabbas and crucify Jesus. Pilate writes a sign in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek that reads \"Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews\" (abbreviated as INRI in depictions) to be affixed to Jesus' cross, then scourges Jesus and sends him to be crucified. The soldiers place a Crown of Thorns on Jesus' head and ridicule him as the King of the Jews. They beat and taunt him before taking him to Calvary, also called Golgotha, for crucifixion.\n\n\n==== Crucifixion and entombment ====\n\nJesus' crucifixion is described in all four canonical gospels. After the trials, Jesus is led to Calvary carrying his cross; the route traditionally thought to have been taken is known as the Via Dolorosa. The three Synoptic Gospels indicate that Simon of Cyrene assists him, having been compelled by the Romans to do so. In Luke 23:27\u201328, Jesus tells the women in the multitude of people following him not to weep for him but for themselves and their children. At Calvary, Jesus is offered a sponge soaked in a concoction usually offered as a painkiller. According to Matthew and Mark, he refuses it.The soldiers then crucify Jesus and cast lots for his clothes. Above Jesus' head on the cross is Pilate's inscription, \"Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.\" Soldiers and passersby mock him about it. Two convicted thieves are crucified along with Jesus. In Matthew and Mark, both thieves mock Jesus. In Luke, one of them rebukes Jesus, while the other defends him. Jesus tells the latter: \"today you will be with me in Paradise.\" In John, Mary, the mother of Jesus, and the beloved disciple were at the crucifixion. Jesus tells the beloved disciple to take care of his mother.The Roman soldiers break the two thieves' legs (a procedure designed to hasten death in a crucifixion), but they do not break those of Jesus, as he is already dead (John 19:33). In John 19:34, one soldier pierces Jesus' side with a lance, and blood and water flow out. In the Synoptics, when Jesus dies, the heavy curtain at the Temple is torn. In Matthew 27:51\u201354, an earthquake breaks open tombs. In Matthew and Mark, terrified by the events, a Roman centurion states that Jesus was the Son of God.On the same day, Joseph of Arimathea, with Pilate's permission and with Nicodemus' help, removes Jesus' body from the cross, wraps him in a clean cloth, and buries him in his new rock-hewn tomb. In Matthew 27:62\u201366, on the following day the chief Jewish priests ask Pilate for the tomb to be secured, and with Pilate's permission the priests place seals on the large stone covering the entrance.\n\n\n=== Resurrection and ascension ===\n\nMary Magdalene (alone in the Gospel of John, but accompanied by other women in the Synoptics) goes to Jesus' tomb on Sunday morning and is surprised to find it empty. Despite Jesus' teaching, the disciples had not understood that Jesus would rise again.\nIn Matthew 28, there are guards at the tomb. An angel descends from Heaven, and opens the tomb. The guards faint from fear. Jesus appears to Mary Magdalene and \"the other Mary\" after they visited the tomb. Jesus then appears to the eleven remaining disciples in Galilee and commissions them to baptize all nations in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, \"teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you.\"\nIn Mark 16, Salome and Mary, mother of James are with Mary Magdalene. In the tomb, a young man in a white robe (an angel) tells them that Jesus will meet his disciples in Galilee, as he had told them (referring to Mark 14:28).\nIn Luke, Mary and various other women meet two angels at the tomb, but the eleven disciples do not believe their story. Jesus appears to two of his followers in Emmaus. He also makes an appearance to Peter. Jesus then appears that same day to his disciples in Jerusalem. Although he appears and vanishes mysteriously, he also eats and lets them touch him to prove that he is not a spirit. He repeats his command to bring his teaching to all nations.\nIn John, Mary is alone at first, but Peter and the beloved disciple come and see the tomb as well. Jesus then appears to Mary at the tomb. He later appears to the disciples, breathes on them, and gives them the power to forgive and retain sins. In a second visit to disciples, he proves to a doubting disciple (\"Doubting Thomas\") that he is flesh and blood. The disciples return to Galilee, where Jesus makes another appearance. He performs a miracle known as the catch of 153 fish at the Sea of Galilee, after which Jesus encourages Peter to serve his followers.Jesus' ascension into Heaven is described in Luke 24:50\u201353, Acts 1:1\u201311 and mentioned in 1 Timothy 3:16. In the Acts of the Apostles, forty days after the Resurrection, as the disciples look on, \"he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight\". 1 Peter 3:22 states that Jesus has \"gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God\".The Acts of the Apostles describes several appearances of Jesus after his Ascension. In Acts 7:55, Stephen gazes into heaven and sees \"Jesus standing at the right hand of God\" just before his death. On the road to Damascus, the Apostle Paul is converted to Christianity after seeing a blinding light and hearing a voice saying, \"I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.\" In Acts 9:10\u201318, Jesus instructs Ananias of Damascus in a vision to heal Paul. The Book of Revelation includes a revelation from Jesus concerning the last days.\n\n\n== Early Christianity ==\n\nAfter Jesus' life, his followers, as described in the first chapters of the Acts of the Apostles, were all Jews either by birth or conversion, for which the biblical term \"proselyte\" is used, and referred to by historians as Jewish Christians. The early Gospel message was spread orally, probably in Aramaic, but almost immediately also in Greek. The New Testament's Acts of the Apostles and Epistle to the Galatians record that the first Christian community was centered in Jerusalem and its leaders included Peter, James, the brother of Jesus, and John the Apostle.After the conversion of Paul the Apostle, he claimed the title of \"Apostle to the Gentiles\". Paul's influence on Christian thinking is said to be more significant than that of any other New Testament author. By the end of the 1st century, Christianity began to be recognized internally and externally as a separate religion from Judaism which itself was refined and developed further in the centuries after the destruction of the Second Temple.Numerous quotations in the New Testament and other Christian writings of the first centuries, indicate that early Christians generally used and revered the Hebrew Bible (the Tanakh) as religious text, mostly in the Greek (Septuagint) or Aramaic (Targum) translations.Early Christians wrote many religious works, including the ones included in the canon of the New Testament.  The canonical texts, which have become the main sources used by historians to try to understand the historical Jesus and sacred texts within Christianity, were probably written between 50 and 120 AD.\n\n\n== Historical views ==\n\nPrior to the Enlightenment, the Gospels were usually regarded as accurate historical accounts, but since then scholars have emerged who question the reliability of the Gospels and draw a distinction between the Jesus described in the Gospels and the Jesus of history. Since the 18th century, three separate scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during the quest that applied them. While there is widespread scholarly agreement on the existence of Jesus, and a basic consensus on the general outline of his life, the portraits of Jesus constructed by various scholars often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the gospel accounts.Approaches to the historical reconstruction of the life of Jesus have varied from the \"maximalist\" approaches of the 19th century, in which the gospel accounts were accepted as reliable evidence wherever it is possible, to the \"minimalist\" approaches of the early 20th century, where hardly anything about Jesus was accepted as historical. In the 1950s, as the second quest for the historical Jesus gathered pace, the minimalist approaches faded away, and in the 21st century, minimalists such as Price are a very small minority. Although a belief in the inerrancy of the Gospels cannot be supported historically, many scholars since the 1980s have held that, beyond the few facts considered to be historically certain, certain other elements of Jesus' life are \"historically probable\". Modern scholarly research on the historical Jesus thus focuses on identifying the most probable elements.\n\n\n=== Judea and Galilee in the 1st century ===\n\nIn AD 6, Judea, Idumea, and Samaria were transformed from a client kingdom of the Roman Empire into an imperial province, also called Judea. A Roman prefect, rather than a client king, ruled the land. The prefect ruled from Caesarea Maritima, leaving Jerusalem to be run by the High Priest of Israel. As an exception, the prefect came to Jerusalem during religious festivals, when religious and patriotic enthusiasm sometimes inspired unrest or uprisings. Gentile lands surrounded the Jewish territories of Judea and Galilee, but Roman law and practice allowed Jews to remain separate legally and culturally. Galilee was evidently prosperous, and poverty was limited enough that it did not threaten the social order.This was the era of Hellenistic Judaism, which combined Jewish religious tradition with elements of Hellenistic Greek culture. Until the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the Muslim conquests of the Eastern Mediterranean, the main centers of Hellenistic Judaism were Alexandria (Egypt) and Antioch (now Southern Turkey), the two main Greek urban settlements of the Middle East and North Africa area, both founded at the end of the 4th century BCE in the wake of the conquests of Alexander the Great. Hellenistic Judaism also existed in Jerusalem during the Second Temple Period, where there was conflict between Hellenizers and traditionalists (sometimes called Judaizers). The Hebrew Bible was translated from Biblical Hebrew and Biblical Aramaic into Jewish Koine Greek; the Targum translations into Aramaic were also generated during this era, both due to the decline of knowledge of Hebrew.Jews based their faith and religious practice on the Torah, five books said to have been given by God to Moses. The three prominent religious parties were the Pharisees, the Essenes, and the Sadducees. Together these parties represented only a small fraction of the population. Most Jews looked forward to a time that God would deliver them from their pagan rulers, possibly through war against the Romans.\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\nNew Testament scholars face a formidable challenge when they analyze the canonical Gospels.\nThe Gospels are not biographies in the modern sense, and the authors explain Jesus' theological significance and recount his public ministry while omitting many details of his life.\nThe reports of supernatural events associated with Jesus' death and resurrection make the challenge even more difficult.\nScholars regard the Gospels as compromised sources of information because the writers were trying to glorify Jesus.\nEven so, the sources for Jesus' life are better than sources scholars have for the life of Alexander the Great.\nScholars use a number of criteria, such as the criterion of independent attestation, the criterion of coherence, and the criterion of discontinuity to judge the historicity of events. The historicity of an event also depends on the reliability of the source; indeed, the Gospels are not independent nor consistent records of Jesus' life. Mark, which is most likely the earliest written gospel, has been considered for many decades the most historically accurate. John, the latest written gospel, differs considerably from the Synoptic Gospels, and thus is generally considered less reliable, although more and more scholars now also recognize that it may contain a core of older material as historically valuable as the Synoptic tradition or even more so.Some scholars (most notably the Jesus Seminar) believe that the non-canonical Gospel of Thomas might be an independent witness to many of Jesus' parables and aphorisms. For example, Thomas confirms that Jesus blessed the poor and that this saying circulated independently before being combined with similar sayings in the Q source. However, the majority scholars are sceptic about this text and believe it should be dated to the 2nd century CE instead.Other select non-canonical Christian texts may also have value for historical Jesus research.Early non-Christian sources that attest to the historical existence of Jesus include the works of the historians Josephus and Tacitus. Josephus scholar Louis Feldman has stated that \"few have doubted the genuineness\" of Josephus' reference to Jesus in book 20 of the Antiquities of the Jews, and it is disputed only by a small number of scholars. Tacitus referred to Christ and his execution by Pilate in book 15 of his work Annals. Scholars generally consider Tacitus' reference to the execution of Jesus to be both authentic and of historical value as an independent Roman source.Non-Christian sources are valuable in two ways. First, they show that even neutral or hostile parties never show any doubt that Jesus actually existed. Second, they present a rough picture of Jesus that is compatible with that found in the Christian sources: that Jesus was a teacher, had a reputation as a miracle worker, had a brother James, and died a violent death.Archaeology helps scholars better understand Jesus' social world. Recent archaeological work, for example, indicates that Capernaum, a city important in Jesus' ministry, was poor and small, without even a forum or an agora. This archaeological discovery resonates well with the scholarly view that Jesus advocated reciprocal sharing among the destitute in that area of Galilee.\n\n\n=== Chronology ===\n\nJesus was a Galilean Jew, born around the beginning of the 1st century, who died in 30 or 33 AD in Judea. The general scholarly consensus is that Jesus was a contemporary of John the Baptist and was crucified as ordered by the Roman governor Pontius Pilate, who held office from 26 to 36 AD.The Gospels offer several indications concerning the year of Jesus' birth. Matthew 2:1 associates the birth of Jesus with the reign of Herod the Great, who died around 4 BC, and Luke 1:5 mentions that Herod was on the throne shortly before the birth of Jesus, although this gospel also associates the birth with the Census of Quirinius which took place ten years later. Luke 3:23 states that Jesus was \"about thirty years old\" at the start of his ministry, which according to Acts 10:37\u201338 was preceded by John the Baptist's ministry, which was recorded in Luke 3:1\u20132 to have begun in the 15th year of Tiberius' reign (28 or 29 AD). By collating the gospel accounts with historical data and using various other methods, most scholars arrive at a date of birth for Jesus between 6 and 4 BC, but some propose estimates that include a wider range.The date range for Jesus' ministry have been estimated using several different approaches. One of these applies the reference in Luke 3:1\u20132, Acts 10:37\u201338 and the dates of Tiberius' reign, which are well known, to give a date of around 28\u201329 AD for the start of Jesus' ministry. Another approach estimates a date around 27\u201329 AD by using the statement about the temple in John 2:13\u201320, which asserts that the temple in Jerusalem was in its 46th year of construction at the start of Jesus' ministry, together with Josephus' statement that the temple's reconstruction was started by Herod the Great in the 18th year of his reign. A further method uses the date of the death of John the Baptist and the marriage of Herod Antipas to Herodias, based on the writings of Josephus, and correlates it with Matthew 14:4 and Mark 6:18. Given that most scholars date the marriage of Herod and Herodias as AD 28\u201335, this yields a date about 28\u201329 AD.A number of approaches have been used to estimate the year of the crucifixion of Jesus. Most scholars agree that he died in 30 or 33 AD. The Gospels state that the event occurred during the prefecture of Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea from 26 to 36 AD. The date for the conversion of Paul (estimated to be 33\u201336 AD) acts as an upper bound for the date of Crucifixion. The dates for Paul's conversion and ministry can be determined by analyzing the Pauline epistles and the Acts of the Apostles. Astronomers have tried to estimate the precise date of the Crucifixion by analyzing lunar motion and calculating historic dates of Passover, a festival based on the lunisolar Hebrew calendar. The most widely accepted dates derived from this method are April 7, 30 AD, and April 3, 33 AD (both Julian).\n\n\n=== Historicity of events ===\n\nNearly all historical scholars accept Jesus's historical existence as a real person. Scholars have reached a limited consensus on the basics of Jesus' life.\n\n\n==== Family ====\n\nMany scholars agree that Joseph, Jesus' father, died before Jesus began his ministry. Joseph is not mentioned at all in the Gospels during Jesus' ministry. Joseph's death would explain why in Mark 6:3, Jesus' neighbors refer to Jesus as the \"son of Mary\" (sons were usually identified by their fathers).According to Theissen and Merz, it is common for extraordinary charismatic leaders, such as Jesus, to come into conflict with their ordinary families. In Mark, Jesus' family comes to get him, fearing that he is mad (Mark 3:20\u201334), and this account is thought to be historical because early Christians would likely not have invented it. After Jesus' death, many members of his family joined the Christian movement. Jesus' brother James became a leader of the Jerusalem Church.G\u00e9za Vermes says that the doctrine of the virgin birth of Jesus arose from theological development rather than from historical events.\nDespite the widely held view that the authors of the Synoptic Gospels drew upon each other (the so-called synoptic problem), other scholars take it as significant that the virgin birth is attested by two separate gospels, Matthew and Luke.According to E. P. Sanders, the birth narratives in the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke are the clearest case of invention in the Gospel narratives of Jesus' life. Both accounts have Jesus born in Bethlehem, in accordance with Jewish salvation history, and both have him growing up in Nazareth. But Sanders points that the two Gospels report completely different and irreconcilable explanations for how that happened. Luke's account of a census in which everyone returned to their ancestral cities is not plausible. Matthew's account is more plausible, but the story reads as though it was invented to identify Jesus as like a new Moses, and the historian Josephus reports Herod the Great's brutality without ever mentioning that he massacred little boys. The contradictions between the two Gospels was probably apparent to the early Christians already, since attempts to harmonize the two narratives are already present in the earlier apochryphal infancy gospels (the Infancy Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of James), which are dated to the 2nd century CE.Sanders says that the genealogies of Jesus are based not on historical information but on the authors' desire to show that Jesus was the universal Jewish savior. In any event, once the doctrine of the virgin birth of Jesus became established, that tradition superseded the earlier tradition that he was descended from David through Joseph. The Gospel of Luke reports that Jesus was a blood relative of John the Baptist, but scholars generally consider this connection to be invented.\n\n\n==== Baptism ====\n\nMost modern scholars consider Jesus' baptism to be a definite historical fact, along with his crucifixion. Theologian James D. G. Dunn states that they \"command almost universal assent\" and \"rank so high on the 'almost impossible to doubt or deny' scale of historical facts\" that they are often the starting points for the study of the historical Jesus. Scholars adduce the criterion of embarrassment, saying that early Christians would not have invented a baptism that might imply that Jesus committed sins and wanted to repent. According to Theissen and Merz, Jesus was inspired by John the Baptist and took over from him many elements of his teaching.\n\n\n==== Ministry in Galilee ====\nMost scholars hold that Jesus lived in Galilee and Judea and did not preach or study elsewhere. They agree that Jesus debated with Jewish authorities on the subject of God, performed some healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. Jesus' Jewish critics considered his ministry to be scandalous because he feasted with sinners, fraternized with women, and allowed his followers to pluck grain on the Sabbath. According to Sanders, it is not plausible that disagreements over how to interpret the Law of Moses and the Sabbath would have led Jewish authorities to want Jesus killed.According to Ehrman, Jesus taught that a coming kingdom was everyone's proper focus, not anything in this life. He taught about the Jewish Law, seeking its true meaning, sometimes in opposition to other traditions. Jesus put love at the center of the Law, and following that Law was an apocalyptic necessity. His ethical teachings called for forgiveness, not judging others, loving enemies, and caring for the poor. Funk and Hoover note that typical of Jesus were paradoxical or surprising turns of phrase, such as advising one, when struck on the cheek, to offer the other cheek to be struck as well.The Gospels portray Jesus teaching in well-defined sessions, such as the Sermon on the Mount in the Gospel of Matthew or the parallel Sermon on the Plain in Luke. According to Gerd Theissen and Annette Merz, these teaching sessions include authentic teachings of Jesus, but the scenes were invented by the respective evangelists to frame these teachings, which had originally been recorded without context. While Jesus' miracles fit within the social context of antiquity, he defined them differently. First, he attributed them to the faith of those healed. Second, he connected them to end times prophecy.Jesus chose twelve disciples (the \"Twelve\"), evidently as an apocalyptic message. All three Synoptics mention the Twelve, although the names on Luke's list vary from those in Mark and Matthew, suggesting that Christians were not certain who all the disciples were. The twelve disciples might have represented the twelve original tribes of Israel, which would be restored once God's rule was instituted. The disciples were reportedly meant to be the rulers of the tribes in the coming Kingdom. According to Bart Ehrman, Jesus' promise that the Twelve would rule is historical, because the Twelve included Judas Iscariot. In Ehrman's view, no Christians would have invented a line from Jesus, promising rulership to the disciple who betrayed him.\nIn Mark, the disciples play hardly any role other than a negative one. While others sometimes respond to Jesus with complete faith, his disciples are puzzled and doubtful. They serve as a foil to Jesus and to other characters. The failings of the disciples are probably exaggerated in Mark, and the disciples make a better showing in Matthew and Luke.Sanders says that Jesus' mission was not about repentance, although he acknowledges that this opinion is unpopular. He argues that repentance appears as a strong theme only in Luke, that repentance was John the Baptist's message, and that Jesus' ministry would not have been scandalous if the sinners he ate with had been repentant. According to Theissen and Merz, Jesus taught that God was generously giving people an opportunity to repent.\n\n\n==== Role ====\nJesus taught that an apocalyptic figure, the \"Son of Man\", would soon come on clouds of glory to gather the elect, or chosen ones. He referred to himself as a \"son of man\" in the colloquial sense of \"a person\", but scholars do not know whether he also meant himself when he referred to the heavenly \"Son of Man\". Paul the Apostle and other early Christians interpreted the \"Son of Man\" as the risen Jesus.The Gospels refer to Jesus not only as a messiah but in the absolute form as \"the Messiah\" or, equivalently, \"the Christ\". In early Judaism, this absolute form of the title is not found, but only phrases such as \"his messiah\". The tradition is ambiguous enough to leave room for debate as to whether Jesus defined his eschatological role as that of the messiah. The Jewish messianic tradition included many different forms, some of them focused on a messiah figure and others not. Based on the Christian tradition, Gerd Theissen advances the hypothesis that Jesus saw himself in messianic terms but did not claim the title \"Messiah\". Bart Ehrman argues that Jesus did consider himself to be the messiah, albeit in the sense that he would be the king of the new political order that God would usher in, not in the sense that most people today think of the term.\n\n\n==== Passover and crucifixion in Jerusalem ====\nAround AD 30, Jesus and his followers traveled from Galilee to Jerusalem to observe Passover. Jesus caused a disturbance in the Second Temple, which was the center of Jewish religious and civil authority. Sanders associates it with Jesus' prophecy that the Temple would be totally demolished. Jesus held a last meal with his disciples, which is the origin of the Christian sacrament of bread and wine. His words as recorded in the Synoptic gospels and Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians do not entirely agree, but this symbolic meal appears to have pointed to Jesus' place in the coming Kingdom of God when very probably Jesus knew he was about to be killed, although he may have still hoped that God might yet intervene.The Gospels say that Jesus was betrayed to the authorities by a disciple, and many scholars consider this report to be highly reliable. He was executed on the orders of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect of Judaea. Pilate most likely saw Jesus' reference to the Kingdom of God as a threat to Roman authority and worked with the Temple elites to have Jesus executed. The Sadducean high-priestly leaders of the Temple more plausibly had Jesus executed for political reasons than for his teaching. They may have regarded him as a threat to stability, especially after he caused a disturbance at the Second Temple. Other factors, such as Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, may have contributed to this decision. Most scholars consider Jesus' crucifixion to be factual, because early Christians would not have invented the painful death of their leader.\n\n\n==== After crucifixion ====\n\nAfter Jesus' death, his followers said he was restored to life, although exact details of their experiences are unclear. The gospel reports contradict each other, possibly suggesting competition among those claiming to have seen him first rather than deliberate fraud. On the other hand, L. Michael White suggests that inconsistencies in the Gospels reflect differences in the agendas of their unknown authors. The followers of Jesus formed a community to wait for his return and the founding of his kingdom.\n\n\n=== Portraits of Jesus ===\n\nModern research on the historical Jesus has not led to a unified picture of the historical figure, partly because of the variety of academic traditions represented by the scholars. Given the scarcity of historical sources, it is generally difficult for any scholar to construct a portrait of Jesus that can be considered historically valid beyond the basic elements of his life. The portraits of Jesus constructed in these quests often differ from each other, and from the image portrayed in the Gospels.Jesus is seen as the founder of, in the words of Sanders, a '\"renewal movement within Judaism.\" One of the criteria used to discern historical details in the \"third quest\" is the criterion of plausibility, relative to Jesus' Jewish context and to his influence on Christianity. A disagreement in contemporary research is whether Jesus was apocalyptic. Most scholars conclude that he was an apocalyptic preacher, like John the Baptist and Paul the Apostle. In contrast, certain prominent North American scholars, such as Burton Mack and John Dominic Crossan, advocate for a non-eschatological Jesus, one who is more of a Cynic sage than an apocalyptic preacher. In addition to portraying Jesus as an apocalyptic prophet, a charismatic healer or a cynic philosopher, some scholars portray him as the true messiah or an egalitarian prophet of social change. However, the attributes described in the portraits sometimes overlap, and scholars who differ on some attributes sometimes agree on others.Since the 18th century, scholars have occasionally put forth that Jesus was a political national messiah, but the evidence for this portrait is negligible. Likewise, the proposal that Jesus was a Zealot does not fit with the earliest strata of the Synoptic tradition.\n\n\n=== Language, ethnicity, and appearance ===\n\nJesus grew up in Galilee and much of his ministry took place there. The languages spoken in Galilee and Judea during the 1st century AD include Jewish Palestinian Aramaic, Hebrew, and Greek, with Aramaic being predominant. There is substantial consensus that Jesus gave most of his teachings in Aramaic in the Galilean dialect.Modern scholars agree that Jesus was a Jew of 1st-century Palestine. Ioudaios in New Testament Greek is a term which in the contemporary context may refer to religion (Second Temple Judaism), ethnicity (of Judea), or both. In a review of the state of modern scholarship, Amy-Jill Levine writes that the entire question of ethnicity is \"fraught with difficulty\", and that \"beyond recognizing that 'Jesus was Jewish', rarely does the scholarship address what being 'Jewish' means\".The New Testament gives no description of the physical appearance of Jesus before his death\u2014it is generally indifferent to racial appearances and does not refer to the features of the people it mentions. Jesus probably looked like a typical Jew of his time and according to some scholars was likely to have had a sinewy appearance due to his ascetic and itinerant lifestyle. One scholar has drawn on biblical and extra-biblical sources, to suggest an appearance of Jesus much different from that of Western art. Unlike such depictions, his clothing may have suggested poverty consisting of a mantle (shawl) with tassels, a knee-length basic tunic and sandals.\n\n\n=== Christ myth theory ===\n\nThe Christ myth theory is the hypothesis that Jesus of Nazareth never existed; or if he did, that he had virtually nothing to do with the founding of Christianity and the accounts in the gospels. Stories of Jesus' birth, along with other key events, have so many mythic elements that some scholars have suggested that Jesus himself was a myth.Bruno Bauer (1809\u20131882) taught that the first Gospel was a work of literature that produced history rather than described it.\nAccording to Albert Kalthoff (1850\u20131906), a social movement produced Jesus when it encountered Jewish messianic expectations.Arthur Drews (1865\u20131935) saw Jesus as the concrete form of a myth that predated Christianity.\nDespite arguments put forward by authors who have questioned the existence of a historical Jesus, there remains a strong consensus in historical-critical biblical scholarship that a historical Jesus did live in that area and in that time period.\n\n\n== Perspectives ==\n\nApart from his own disciples and followers, the Jews of Jesus' day generally rejected him as the messiah, as do the great majority of Jews today. Christian theologians, ecumenical councils, reformers and others have written extensively about Jesus over the centuries. Christian sects and schisms have often been defined or characterized by their descriptions of Jesus. Meanwhile, Manichaeans, Gnostics, Muslims, Druzes, The Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, and others, have found prominent places for Jesus in their religions.\n\n\n=== Christian ===\n\nJesus is the central figure of Christianity. Although Christian views of Jesus vary, it is possible to summarize the key beliefs shared among major denominations, as stated in their catechetical or confessional texts. Christian views of Jesus are derived from various sources, including the canonical gospels and New Testament letters such as the Pauline epistles and the Johannine writings. These documents outline the key beliefs held by Christians about Jesus, including his divinity, humanity, and earthly life, and that he is the Christ and the Son of God. Despite their many shared beliefs, not all Christian denominations agree on all doctrines, and both major and minor differences on teachings and beliefs have persisted throughout Christianity for centuries.The New Testament states that the resurrection of Jesus is the foundation of the Christian faith. Christians believe that through his sacrificial death and resurrection, humans can be reconciled with God and are thereby offered salvation and the promise of eternal life. Recalling the words of John the Baptist on the day after Jesus' baptism, these doctrines sometimes refer to Jesus as the Lamb of God, who was crucified to fulfill his role as the servant of God. Jesus is thus seen as the new and last Adam, whose obedience contrasts with Adam's disobedience. Christians view Jesus as a role model, whose God-focused life believers are encouraged to imitate.Most Christians believe that Jesus was both human and the Son of God. While there has been theological debate over his nature, Trinitarian Christians generally believe that Jesus is the Logos, God's incarnation and God the Son, both fully divine and fully human. However, the doctrine of the Trinity is not universally accepted among Christians. With the Reformation, Christians such as Michael Servetus and the Socinians started questioning the ancient creeds that had established Jesus' two natures. Nontrinitarian Christian groups include The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Unitarians and Jehovah's Witnesses.Christians revere not only Jesus himself, but also his name. Devotions to the Holy Name of Jesus go back to the earliest days of Christianity. These devotions and feasts exist in both Eastern and Western Christianity.\n\n\n=== Jewish ===\n\nA central tenet of Judaism is the absolute unity and singularity of God and the worship of a person is understood as a form of idolatry. Therefore, Judaism rejects the idea of Jesus (or any future Jewish messiah) being God, or a mediator to God, or part of a Trinity. It holds that Jesus is not the messiah, arguing that he neither fulfilled the Messianic prophecies in the Tanakh nor embodied the personal qualifications of the Messiah. Jews argue that Jesus did not fulfill prophesies to build the Third Temple, gather Jews back to Israel, bring world peace, and unite humanity under the God of Israel. Furthermore, according to Jewish tradition, there were no prophets after Malachi, who delivered his prophesies in the 5th century BC.Judaic criticism of Jesus is long-standing. The Talmud, written and compiled from the 3rd to the 5th century AD, includes stories that since medieval times have been considered to be defamatory accounts of Jesus. In one such story, Yeshu HaNozri (\"Jesus the Nazarene\"), a lewd apostate, is executed by the Jewish high court for spreading idolatry and practicing magic. The form Yeshu is an acronym which in Hebrew reads: \"may his name and memory be blotted out.\"  The majority of contemporary scholars consider that this material provides no information on the historical Jesus. The Mishneh Torah, a late 12th-century work of Jewish law written by Moses Maimonides, states that Jesus is a \"stumbling block\" who makes \"the majority of the world to err and serve a god other than the Lord\".Medieval Hebrew literature contains the anecdotal \"Episode of Jesus\" (known also as Toledot Yeshu), in which Jesus is described as being the son of Joseph, the son of Pandera (see: Episode of Jesus). The account portrays Jesus as an impostor.\n\n\n=== Islamic ===\n\nA major figure in Islam, Jesus (often referred to by his Quranic name \u02bf\u012as\u0101) is considered to be a messenger of God (Allah) and the messiah (al-Masih) who was sent to guide the Children of Israel (Bani Isra'il) with a new scripture, the Gospel (referred to in Islam as Injil). Muslims regard the gospels accounts in the New Testament as partially authentic, and believe that Jesus' original message was altered (tahrif) and that Muhammad came later to revive it. Belief in Jesus (and all other messengers of God) is a requirement for being a Muslim. The Quran mentions Jesus by name 25 times\u2014more often than Muhammad\u2014and emphasizes that Jesus was a mortal human who, like all other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God's message. While the Quran affirms the Virgin birth of Jesus, he is considered to be neither an incarnation nor a son of God. Islamic texts emphasize a strict notion of monotheism (tawhid) and forbid the association of partners with God, which would be idolatry.The Quran describes the annunciation to Mary (Maryam) by the Holy Spirit that she is to give birth to Jesus while remaining a virgin. It calls the virgin birth a miracle that occurred by the will of God. The Quran (Q21:91 and Q66:12) states that God breathed his spirit into Mary while she was chaste. Jesus is called a \"spirit from God\" because he was born through the action of the Spirit, but that belief does not imply his pre-existence.To aid in his ministry to the Jewish people, Jesus was given the ability to perform miracles, by permission of God rather than by his own power. Through his ministry, Jesus is seen as a precursor to Muhammad. In the Quran (Q4:157\u2013159) it is said that Jesus was not killed but was merely made to appear that way to unbelievers, and that he was raised into the heavens while still alive by God. According to most classic Sunni and Twelver Shi'ite interpretations of these verses, the likeness of Jesus was cast upon a substitute (most often one of the apostles), who was crucified in Jesus' stead. However, some medieval Muslims (a.o., the ghulat writing under the name of al\u2010Mufaddal ibn Umar al\u2010Ju'fi, the Brethren of Purity, Isma'ili philosophers like Abu Hatim al-Razi, Abu Tammam, Ja'far ibn Mansur al-Yaman, Abu Yaqub al-Sijistani and Ibrahim al-Hamidi, and the Sunni mystic al-Ghazali) affirmed the historicity of Jesus' crucifixion, holding the docetic view that although Jesus' human form (his body) had died on the cross, his true divine nature (his spirit) had survived and ascended unto heaven, so that his death was only an appearance. Nevertheless, to Muslims it is the ascension rather than the crucifixion that constitutes a major event in the life of Jesus. There is no mention of his resurrection on the third day, and his death plays no special role in Islamic theories of salvation. However, Jesus is a central figure in Islamic eschatology: Muslims believe that he will return to Earth at the end of time and defeat the Antichrist (ad-Dajjal) by killing him.\n\n\n==== Isma'ili faith ====\nAccording to Qadi al-Nu'man, a famous Muslim jurist of the Fatimid period, Jesus is referred to as the messiah (al-mas\u012b\u1e25) in the Quran because he was sent to the people who responded to him in order to remove (masa\u1e25a) their impurities, the ailments of their faith; whether apparent (\u1e93\u0101hir) or hidden (b\u0101\u1e6din). Qadi al-Nu'man, in his work Foundation of Symbolic Interpretation (As\u0101s al-ta'w\u012bl), talks about the spiritual birth (m\u012bl\u0101d al-b\u0101\u1e6din) of Jesus, as an interpretation of his story of physical birth (m\u012bl\u0101d al-\u1e93\u0101hir) mentioned in the Quran. He says that Mary, the mother of Jesus, is a metaphor for someone who nurtured and instructed Jesus (l\u0101hiq), rather than physically giving birth to him. Qadi al-Nu'man explains that Jesus was from the pure progeny of Abraham, just as Ali and his sons were from the pure progeny of Muhammad, through Fatima.\n\n\n==== Ahmadiyya Islam ====\n\nThe Ahmadiyya Muslim Community has several distinct teachings about Jesus. Ahmadis believe that he was a mortal man who survived his crucifixion and died a natural death at the age of 120 in Kashmir, India, and is buried at Roza Bal.\n\n\n=== Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith ===\nThe teaching of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith consider Jesus to be a manifestation of God, a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed concept for prophets\u2014intermediaries between God and humanity, serving as messengers and reflecting God's qualities and attributes. The Bah\u00e1'\u00ed concept emphasizes the simultaneous qualities of humanity and divinity; thus, it is similar to the Christian concept of incarnation. Bah\u00e1'\u00ed thought accepts Jesus as the Son of God. In Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed thought, Jesus was a perfect incarnation of God's attributes, but Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed teachings reject the idea that \"ineffable essence\" of the Divinity was contained within a single human body because of their beliefs regarding \"omnipresence and transcendence of the essence of God\".Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, the founder of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, wrote that since each manifestation of God has the same divine attributes, they can be seen as the spiritual \"return\" of all previous manifestations of God, and the appearance of each new manifestation of God inaugurates a religion that supersedes the former ones, a concept known as progressive revelation. Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds believe that God's plan unfolds gradually through this process as mankind matures, and that some of the manifestations arrive in specific fulfillment of the missions of previous ones. Thus, Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds believe that Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h is the promised return of Christ. Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed teachings confirm many, but not all, aspects of Jesus as portrayed in the Gospels. Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds believe in the virgin birth and in the Crucifixion, but see the Resurrection and the miracles of Jesus as symbolic.\n\n\n=== Other ===\n\nIn Christian Gnosticism (now a largely extinct religious movement), Jesus was sent from the divine realm and provided the secret knowledge (gnosis) necessary for salvation. Most Gnostics believed that Jesus was a human who became possessed by the spirit of \"the Christ\" at his baptism. This spirit left Jesus' body during the crucifixion, but was rejoined to him when he was raised from the dead. Some Gnostics, however, were docetics, believed that Jesus did not have a physical body, but only appeared to possess one. Manichaeism, a Gnostic sect, accepted Jesus as a prophet, in addition to revering Gautama Buddha and Zoroaster. In the Druze faith, Jesus is considered one of God's important prophets, being among the seven prophets who appeared in different periods of history.Some Hindus consider Jesus to be an avatar or a sadhu. Paramahansa Yogananda, an Indian guru, taught that Jesus was the reincarnation of Elisha and a student of John the Baptist, the reincarnation of Elijah. Some Buddhists, including Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, regard Jesus as a bodhisattva who dedicated his life to the welfare of people. The New Age movement entertains a wide variety of views on Jesus. Theosophists, from whom many New Age teachings originated, refer to Jesus as the Master Jesus, a spiritual reformer, and they believe that Christ, after various incarnations, occupied the body of Jesus. The Urantia Book teaches Jesus is one of more than 700,000 heavenly sons of God. Scientologists recognize Jesus (along with other religious figures such as Zoroaster, Muhammad, and Buddha) as part of their \"religious heritage\". Atheists reject Jesus' divinity, but have different views about him \u2013 from challenging his mental health to emphasizing his \"moral superiority\" (Richard Dawkins).\n\n\n== Artistic depictions ==\n\nSome of the earliest depictions of Jesus at the Dura-Europos church are firmly dated to before 256. Thereafter, despite the lack of biblical references or historical records, a wide range of depictions of Jesus appeared during the last two millennia, often influenced by cultural settings, political circumstances and theological contexts. As in other Early Christian art, the earliest depictions date to the late 2nd or early 3rd century, and surviving images are found especially in the Catacombs of Rome.The depiction of Christ in pictorial form was highly controversial in the early Church. From the 5th century onward, flat painted icons became popular in the Eastern Church. The Byzantine Iconoclasm acted as a barrier to developments in the East, but by the 9th century, art was permitted again. The Protestant Reformation brought renewed resistance to imagery, but total prohibition was atypical, and Protestant objections to images have tended to reduce since the 16th century. Although large images are generally avoided, few Protestants now object to book illustrations depicting Jesus. The use of depictions of Jesus is advocated by the leaders of denominations such as Anglicans and Catholics and is a key element of the Eastern Orthodox tradition.The Transfiguration was a major theme in Eastern Christian art, and every Eastern Orthodox monk who had trained in icon painting had to prove his craft by painting an icon depicting it. Icons receive the external marks of veneration, such as kisses and prostration, and they are thought to be powerful channels of divine grace. The Renaissance brought forth a number of artists who focused on depictions of Jesus; Fra Angelico and others followed Giotto in the systematic development of uncluttered images.Before the Protestant Reformation, the crucifix was common in Western Christianity. It is a model of the cross with Jesus crucified on it. The crucifix became the central ornament of the altar in the 13th century, a use that has been nearly universal in Roman Catholic churches since then.Jesus appears as an infant in a manger (feed trough) in Christmas creches, which depict the Nativity scene. He is typically joined by Mary, Joseph, animals, shepherds, angels, and the Magi. Francis of Assisi (1181/82\u20131226) is credited with popularizing the creche, although he probably did not initiate it. The creche reached its height of popularity in the 17th and 18th centuries in southern Europe.\n\n\n== Associated relics ==\n\nThe total destruction that ensued with the siege of Jerusalem by the Romans in AD 70 made the survival of items from 1st-century Judea very rare and almost no direct records survive about the history of Judaism from the last part of the 1st century through the 2nd century. Margaret M. Mitchell writes that although Eusebius reports (Ecclesiastical History III 5.3) that the early Christians left Jerusalem for Pella just before Jerusalem was subjected to the final lockdown, we must accept that no first-hand Christian items from the early Jerusalem Church have reached us. Joe Nickell writes, \"as investigation after investigation has shown, not a single, reliably authenticated relic of Jesus exists.\"However, throughout the history of Christianity, a number of relics attributed to Jesus have been claimed, although doubt has been cast on them. The 16th-century Catholic theologian Erasmus wrote sarcastically about the proliferation of relics and the number of buildings that could have been constructed from the wood claimed to be from the cross used in the Crucifixion. Similarly, while experts debate whether Jesus was crucified with three nails or with four, at least thirty holy nails continue to be venerated as relics across Europe.Some relics, such as purported remnants of the Crown of Thorns, receive only a modest number of pilgrims, while the Shroud of Turin (which is associated with an approved Catholic devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus), has received millions, including popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI.\n\n\n== See also ==\nOutline of Jesus\nJesuism\nJesus in comparative mythology\nJesus in the Talmud\nLast Adam\nList of books about Jesus\nList

\u05d9\u05b5\u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2\u05b7\u200e, romanized: Y\u0113\u0161\u00fba\u02bf), c.\u20094 BC \u2013  AD 30 / 33, also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a first-century Jewish preacher and religious leader. He is the central figure of Christianity, the world's largest religion. Most Christians believe he is the incarnation of God the Son and the awaited messiah (the Christ), prophesied in the Old Testament.Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has yielded some uncertainty on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the Jesus portrayed in the Bible reflects the historical Jesus, as the only records of Jesus' life are contained in the Gospels. Jesus was a Galilean Jew, who was baptized by John the Baptist and began his own ministry. His teachings were initially conserved by oral transmission and he himself was often referred to as \"rabbi\". Jesus debated with fellow Jews on how to best follow God, engaged in healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. Tradition holds that he was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, turned over to the Roman government, and crucified on the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the early Church.Christian doctrines include the beliefs that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit, was born of a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, founded the Christian Church, died by crucifixion as a sacrifice to achieve atonement for sin, rose from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, from where he will return. Commonly, Christians believe Jesus enables people to be reconciled to God. The Nicene Creed asserts that Jesus will judge the living and the dead either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology. The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of the Trinity. A small minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural. The birth of Jesus is celebrated annually on December 25 as Christmas. His crucifixion is honored on Good Friday and his resurrection on Easter Sunday. The widely used calendar era \"AD\", from the Latin anno Domini (\"year of the Lord\"), and the equivalent alternative \"CE\", are based on the approximate birthdate of Jesus.Jesus is also revered outside of Christianity in religions such as Islam, Manicheanism and Baha'i. Manicheanism was the first organised religion outside of Christianity to venerate Jesus, viewing him as an important prophet. In Islam, Jesus (often referred to by his Quranic name \u02bf\u012as\u0101) is considered one of God's important prophets and the messiah. Muslims believe Jesus was born of a virgin, but was neither God nor a son of God. The Quran states that Jesus never claimed divinity. Most Muslims do not believe that he was killed or crucified, but that God raised him into Heaven while he was still alive. In contrast, Judaism rejects the belief that Jesus was the awaited messiah, arguing that he did not fulfill messianic prophecies, and was neither divine nor resurrected."}, "Chan_Buddhism": {"links": ["Dharma", "Catholic Apostolic Church", "Householder ", "Mett\u0101", "Mudra", "Han Dynasty", "S\u014dt\u014d", "Vimalakirti Sutra", "Japamala", "Lenape mythology", "\u015arauta", "Wahhabism", "Buddhism and the Roman world", "Buddhist cosmology", "Yogacara", "Roman Polytheistic Reconstructionism", "Six realms", "If\u00e1", "Benzhuism", "Secularism", "Agnosticism", "Religious terrorism", "Refuge ", "Buddha-nature", "Dhamma vicaya", "Vattisen Yaly", "Antai-ji", "Nath", "Indigenous religious beliefs of the Tagalog people", "Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith and Buddhism", "Five hindrances", "Chinese language", "Sa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101", "Ten Stages Sutra", "Toni Packer", "Tr\u00fac L\u00e2m Temple", "Kaumaram", "Skandha", "Five Ranks", "Fire worship", "Buddhism in France", "Amish", "Heraka", "Mormonism", "Tibetan Buddhist architecture", "Balinese Hinduism", "Religious violence", "Paleo-Balkan mythology", "Avalokite\u015bvara", "Quakers", "Seungsahn", "Babylonian religion", "Heart sutra", "ISBN ", "Kasina", "Anthroposophy", "Buddhism in Taiwan", "Mantra", "An\u0101g\u0101mi", "Dualism in cosmology", "Sunni Islam", "Nanzen-ji", "Tibetan Buddhist canon", "Lama", "Ajahn", "Linji school", "Buddhist economics", "Vassa", "Zen Studies Society", "Curlie", "Udmurt Vos", "Japanese Buddhist architecture", "Maasai mythology", "Ra\u00eblism", "Houn Jiyu-Kennett", "Buddhism in Vietnam", "Skanda ", "Prussian mythology", "Albanian folk beliefs", "Odinani", "Shikantaza", "Pratyutpanna Sam\u0101dhi S\u016btra", "Punna", "Ango", "Lineage ", "Buddhabhadra ", "La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra", "Hakuun Yasutani", "Eisai", "Zazenkai", "Mahasthamaprapta", "Overseas Chinese", "Deism", "Dharma Drum Retreat Center", "Engaged Buddhism", "Unitarian Universalism", "Buddhism in Afghanistan", "Yongjia Xuanjue", "Donyi-Polo", "Kyoto School", "Song dynasty", "Hawaiian religion", "Pur\u00e9pecha religion", "Palo ", "Akan religion", "Gallo-Roman religion", "Meivazhi", "Four sights", "Anishinaabe traditional beliefs", "Buddhism in the Middle East", "M\u0101ori religion", "Nuo folk religion", "V\u1ea1n H\u1ea1nh Zen Temple", "Religion and video games", "Parmalim", "Chinese characters", "Hermeticism", "Quimbanda", "Taisen Deshimaru", "Caucasian neopaganism", "Hsuan Hua", "Syncretism", "Wu wei", "Kensh\u014d", "Merit ", "Pomo religion", "Adventism", "Candombl\u00e9 Bantu", "Vajrayana", "Buddhist art", "Hussites", "Doctrinal background of Zen", "Historical Vedic religion", "Assaji", "Trinidad Orisha", "Ash'ari", "Maitreya", "Mandala", "Mindful Yoga", "Hsing Yun", "\u015a\u016bra\u1e45gama S\u016btra", "Relics associated with Buddha", "Religion and happiness", "Shamanism in Siberia", "Yahwism", "Chinese salvationist religions", "The Gateless Gate", "Shamarpa", "David Kalupahana", "Yarsanism", "Slavic Native Faith", "Umbanda", "Methodism", "Seiza", "Sentient beings ", "Relationship between religion and science", "Ati\u015ba", "Miwok mythology", "Yunmen school", "Muisca mythology", "Prajnaparamita", "Pre-sectarian Buddhism", "Ancient Semitic religion", "Buddhism and Gnosticism", "Yasa", "Indian religions", "Kashmir", "Lugbara mythology", "Sri Vaishnavism", "Islamic modernism", "Simplified Chinese characters", "Buddhism in Kalmykia", "Madhyamaka", "Digambara", "Nature of mind", "Avalokitesvara", "Terma ", "Christadelphians", "Dunhuang manuscripts", "Mindstream", "Dhy\u0101na in Buddhism", "Lutheranism", "Ten Principal Disciples", "Austroasiatic languages", "Imperial cult of ancient Rome", "Nirvana", "Achar ", "Burmese folk religion", "Buddhism in Venezuela", "\u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara", "Dharmakaya", "\u014cry\u014dki", "Holiness movement", "Sui dynasty", "Satipatthana", "Orthopraxy", "Pantheism", "Buddhist temple", "Du\u1e25kha", "Restoration Movement", "Index of Buddhism-related articles", "Maya ", "Buddhist Association of China", "Anuruddha", "Muh\u014d Noelke", "Correlation", "Anag\u0101rika", "Culture of Buddhism", "Wisdom in Buddhism", "Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind", "Buddhism in Cambodia", "Korea", "Tsimshian mythology", "Jikijitsu", "Religion and agriculture", "Daitoku-ji", "Xuefeng Yicun", "Maturidi", "Antireligion", "Miracles of Gautama Buddha", "Non-denominational Muslim", "Hinduism", "Sangha", "Zaidiyyah", "Taixu", "Bhavacakra", "Geoffrey Shugen Arnold", "Spiritual Christianity", "Sanjiejiao", "K\u014dsh\u014d Uchiyama", "Housewives", "Iranian languages", "Yunmen Wenyan", "Buddhism in the Maldives", "Atheism", "Tai folk religion", "San Francisco Zen Center", "Paritta", "D.

\"meditation\" or \"meditative state\"), is a Chinese school of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism. It developed in China from the 6th century CE onwards, becoming dominant during the Tang and Song dynasties. After the Yuan dynasty, Chan more or less fused with Pure Land Buddhism.\nChan is the originating tradition of Zen Buddhism (the Japanese pronunciation of the same character, which is the most commonly used name for the school in English). Chan Buddhism spread from China south to Vietnam as Thi\u1ec1n and north to Korea as Seon, and, in the 13th century, east to Japan as Japanese Zen.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe historical records required for a complete, accurate account of early Chan history no longer exist.\n\n\n=== Periodisation ===\nThe history of Ch\u00e1n in China can be divided into several periods. Zen as we know it today is the result of a long history, with many changes and contingent factors. Each period had different types of Zen, some of which remained influential while others vanished.Ferguson distinguishes three periods from the 5th century into the 13th century:\n\nThe Legendary period, from Bodhidharma in the late 5th century to the An Lushan Rebellion around 765 CE, in the middle of the Tang Dynasty. Little written information is left from this period. It is the time of the Six Patriarchs, including Bodhidharma and Huineng, and the legendary \"split\" between the Northern and the Southern School of Ch\u00e1n.\nThe Classical period, from the end of the An Lushan Rebellion around 765 CE to the beginning of the Song Dynasty around 950 CE. This is the time of the great masters of Ch\u00e1n, such as Mazu Daoyi and Linji Yixuan, and the creation of the y\u00fc-l\u00fc genre, the recordings of the sayings and teachings of these great masters.\nThe Literary period, from around 950 to 1250, which spans the era of the Song Dynasty (960\u20131279). In this time the gongan-collections were compiled, collections of sayings and deeds by the famous masters, appended with poetry and commentary. This genre reflects the influence of literati on the development of Ch\u00e1n. This period idealized the previous period as the \"golden age\" of Ch\u00e1n, producing the literature in which the spontaneity of the celebrated masters was portrayed.Although McRae has reservations about the division of Ch\u00e1n-history in phases or periods, he nevertheless distinguishes four phases in the history of Ch\u00e1n:\nProto-Ch\u00e1n (c. 500\u2013600) (Southern and Northern Dynasties (420 to 589) and Sui Dynasty (589\u2013618 CE)). In this phase, Ch\u00e1n developed in multiple locations in northern China. It was based on the practice of dhyana and is connected to the figures of Bodhidharma and Huike. Its principal text is the Two Entrances and Four Practices, attributed to Bodhidharma.\nEarly Ch\u00e1n (c. 600\u2013900) (Tang Dynasty (618\u2013907 CE)). In this phase Ch\u00e1n took its first clear contours. Prime figures are the fifth patriarch Daman Hongren (601\u2013674), his dharma-heir Yuquan Shenxiu (606?\u2013706), the sixth patriarch Huineng (638\u2013713), protagonist of the quintessential Platform Sutra, and Shenhui (670\u2013762), whose propaganda elevated Huineng to the status of sixth patriarch. Prime factions are the Northern School, Southern School and Oxhead School.\nMiddle Ch\u00e1n (c. 750\u20131000) (from An Lushan Rebellion (755\u2013763) till Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period  (907\u2013960/979)). In this phase developed the well-known Ch\u00e1n of the iconoclastic zen-masters. Prime figures are Mazu Daoyi (709\u2013788), Shitou Xiqian (710\u2013790), Linji Yixuan (died 867), and Xuefeng Yicun (822\u2013908). Prime factions are the Hongzhou school and the Hubei faction. An important text is the Anthology of the Patriarchal Hall (952), which gives a great amount of \"encounter-stories\", and the well-known genealogy of the Ch\u00e1n-school.\nSong Dynasty Ch\u00e1n (c. 950\u20131300). In this phase Ch\u00e1n took its definitive shape including the picture of the \"golden age\" of the Ch\u00e1n of the Tang-Dynasty, and the use of koans for individual study and meditation. Prime figures are Dahui Zonggao (1089\u20131163) who introduced the Hua Tou practice and Hongzhi Zhengjue (1091\u20131157) who emphasized Shikantaza. Prime factions are the Linji school and the Caodong school. The classic koan-collections, such as the Blue Cliff Record were assembled in this period, which reflect the influence of the \"literati\" on the development of Ch\u00e1n. In this phase Ch\u00e1n is transported to Japan, and exerts a great influence on Korean Seon via Jinul.Neither Ferguson nor McRae give a periodisation for Chinese Ch\u00e1n following the Song-dynasty, though McRae mentions \n\n[5.] \"at least a postclassical phase or perhaps multiple phases\".\n\n\n=== Introduction of Buddhism in China (c. 200\u2013500) ===\n\n\n==== Sinification of Buddhism and Taoist influences ====\nWhen Buddhism came to China, it was adapted to the Chinese culture and understanding. Theories about the influence of other schools in the evolution of Chan vary widely and are heavily reliant upon speculative correlation rather than on written records or histories. Some scholars have argued that Chan developed from the interaction between Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism and Taoism, while others insist that Chan has roots in yogic practices, specifically kamma\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na, the consideration of objects, and kasi\u1e47a, total fixation of the mind. A number of other conflicting theories exist.\nBuddhist meditation was practiced in China centuries before the rise of Ch\u00e1n, by people such as An Shigao (c. 148\u2013180 CE) and his school, who translated various Dhy\u0101na sutras (Ch\u00e1n-jing, \u79aa\u7d4c, \"meditation treatises\"), which were influential early meditation texts mostly based on the Yogacara meditation teachings of the Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da school of Kashmir circa 1st-4th centuries CE. The five main types of meditation in the Dyana sutras are anapanasati (mindfulness of breathing); pa\u1e6dik\u016blamanasik\u0101ra meditation, mindfulness of the impurities of the body; loving-kindness maitr\u012b meditation; the contemplation on the twelve links of prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da; and the contemplation on the Buddha's thirty-two Characteristics. Other important translators of meditation texts were Kum\u0101raj\u012bva (334\u2013413 CE), who translated The Sutra on the Concentration of Sitting Meditation, amongst many other texts; and Buddhabhadra. These Chinese translations of mostly Indian Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da Yogacara meditation manuals were the basis for the meditation techniques of Chinese Chan.Buddhism was exposed to Confucian and Taoist influences when it came to China. Goddard quotes D.T. Suzuki, calling Chan a \"natural evolution of Buddhism under Taoist conditions\". Buddhism was first identified to be \"a barbarian variant of Taoism\", and Taoist terminology was used to express Buddhist doctrines in the oldest translations of Buddhist texts, a practice termed ko-i, \"matching the concepts\".\nJudging from the reception by the Han of the Hinayana works and from the early commentaries, it appears that Buddhism was being perceived and digested through the medium of religious Daoism (Taoism). Buddha was seen as a foreign immortal who had achieved some form of Daoist nondeath. The Buddhists' mindfulness of the breath was regarded as an extension of Daoist breathing exercises.\nThe first Buddhist recruits in China were Taoists. They developed high esteem for the newly introduced Buddhist meditational techniques, and blended them with Taoist meditation. Representatives of early Chinese Buddhism like Sengzhao and Tao Sheng were deeply influenced by the Taoist keystone works of Laozi and Zhuangzi. Against this background, especially the Taoist concept of naturalness was inherited by the early Chan disciples: they equated \u2013 to some extent \u2013 the ineffable Tao and Buddha-nature, and thus, rather than feeling bound to the abstract \"wisdom of the s\u016btras\", emphasized Buddha-nature to be found in \"everyday\" human life, just as the Tao.Neo-Daoist concepts were taken over in Chinese Buddhism as well. Concepts such as T'i-yung (\u9ad4\u7528 Essence and Function) and Li-shih (\u7406\u4e8b Noumenon and Phenomenon, or Principle and Practice) were first taken over by Hua-yen Buddhism, which consequently influenced Chan deeply. On the other hand, Taoists at first misunderstood sunyata to be akin to the Taoist non-being.The emerging Chinese Buddhism nevertheless had to compete with Taoism and Confucianism:\nBecause Buddhism was a foreign influence, however, and everything \"barbarian\" was suspect, certain Chinese critics were jolted out of complacency by the spread of the dharma [...] In the first four centuries of the Christian Era, this barbarian influence was infiltrating China just when it was least politically stable and more vulnerable to sedition. As the philosophy and practice infiltrated society, many traditionalists banded together to stop the foreign influence, not so much out of intolerance (an attitude flatly rejected by both Taoism and Confucianism), but because they felt that the Chinese world view was being turned upside down.One point of confusion for this new emerging Chinese Buddhism was the two truths doctrine. Chinese thinking took this to refer to two ontological truths: reality exists on two levels, a relative level and an absolute level. Taoists at first misunderstood sunyata to be akin to the Taoist non-being. In Indian Madhyamaka philosophy the two truths are two epistemological truths: two different ways to look at reality. Based on their understanding of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra the Chinese supposed that the teaching of the Buddha-nature was, as stated by that sutra, the final Buddhist teaching, and that there is an essential truth above sunyata and the two truths.\n\n\n==== Divisions of training ====\nWhen Buddhism came to China, there were three divisions of training:\n\nThe training in virtue and discipline in the precepts (Skt. \u015b\u012bla),\nThe training in mind through meditation (Skt. dhy\u0101na) to attain a luminous and non-reactive state of mind, and\nThe training in the recorded teachings (Skt. Dharma).It was in this context that Buddhism entered into Chinese culture. Three types of teachers with expertise in each training practice developed:\n\nVinaya masters specialized in all the rules of discipline for monks and nuns,\nDhy\u0101na masters specialized in the practice of meditation, and\nDharma masters specialized in mastery of the Buddhist texts.Monasteries and practice centers were created that tended to focus on either the Vinaya and training of monks or the teachings focused on one scripture or a small group of texts. Dhy\u0101na (Chan) masters tended to practice in solitary hermitages, or to be associated with vinaya training monasteries or the dharma teaching centers. The later naming of the Zen school has its origins in this view of the threefold division of training.\nMcRae goes so far as to say:\n\n... one important feature must not be overlooked: Chan was not nearly as separate from these other types of Buddhist activities as one might think [...] [T]he monasteries of which Chan monks became abbots were comprehensive institutions, \"public monasteries\" that supported various types of Buddhist activities other than Chan-style meditation. The reader should bear this point in mind: In contrast to the independent denominations of Soto and Rinzai that emerged (largely by government fiat) in seventeenth-century Japan, there was never any such thing as an institutionally separate Chan \"school\" at any time in Chinese Buddhist history (emphasis McRae).\n\n\n=== Legendary or Proto-Chan (c. 500\u2013600) ===\n\n\n==== Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and the Flower Sermon ====\nThe Chan tradition ascribes the origins of Chan in India to the Flower Sermon, the earliest source for which comes from the 14th century. It is said that Gautama Buddha gathered his disciples one day for a Dharma talk. When they gathered together, the Buddha was completely silent and some speculated that perhaps the Buddha was tired or ill. The Buddha silently held up and twirled a flower and his eyes twinkled; several of his disciples tried to interpret what this meant, though none of them were correct. One of the Buddha's disciples, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, gazed at the flower and smiled. The Buddha then acknowledged Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's insight by saying the following:\nI possess the true Dharma eye, the marvelous mind of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a, the true form of the formless, the subtle Dharma gate that does not rest on words or letters but is a special transmission outside of the scriptures. This I entrust to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa.\n\n\n==== First six patriarchs (c. 500 \u2013 early 8th century) ====\n\nTraditionally the origin of Ch\u00e1n in China is credited to Bodhidharma, an Iranian language speaking Central Asian monk or an Indian monk.The story of his life, and of the Six Patriarchs, was constructed during the Tang Dynasty to lend credibility to the growing Ch\u00e1n-school. Only scarce historical information is available about him, but his hagiography developed when the Chan tradition grew stronger and gained prominence in the early 8th century. By this time a lineage of the six ancestral founders of Chan in China was developed.The actual origins of Ch\u00e1n may lie in ascetic practitioners of Buddhism, who found refuge in forests and mountains. Huike, \"a dhuta (extreme ascetic) who schooled others\" and used the Srimala Sutra, one of the Tath\u0101gatagarbha s\u016btras , figures in the stories about Bodhidharma. Huike is regarded as the second Ch\u00e1n patriarch, appointed by Bodhidharma to succeed him. One of Huike's students, Sengcan, to whom is ascribed the Xinxin Ming, is regarded as the third patriarch.\nBy the late 8th century, under the influence of Huineng's student Shenhui, the traditional list of patriarchs of the Chan lineage had been established:\nBodhidharma (\u9054\u6469) c. 440 \u2013 c. 528\nDazu Huike (\u6167\u53ef) 487\u2013593\nSengcan (\u50e7\u71e6) ?\u2013606\nDayi Daoxin (\u9053\u4fe1) 580\u2013651\nDaman Hongren (\u5f18\u5fcd) 601\u2013674\nHuineng (\u60e0\u80fd) 638\u2013713In later writings this lineage was extended to include 28 Indian patriarchs. In the Song of Enlightenment (\u8b49\u9053\u6b4c Zh\u00e8ngd\u00e0o g\u0113) of Yongjia Xuanjue (\u6c38\u5609\u7384\u89ba, 665\u2013713), one of the chief disciples of Hu\u00ecn\u00e9ng, it is written that Bodhidharma was the 28th patriarch in a line of descent from Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, a disciple of \u015a\u0101kyamuni Buddha, and the first patriarch of Chan Buddhism.\n\n\n==== Lankavatara Sutra ====\nIn its beginnings in China, Chan primarily referred to the Mah\u0101y\u0101na s\u016btras and especially to the La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra. As a result, early masters of the Chan tradition were referred to as \"La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra masters\". As the La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra teaches the doctrine of the Ekay\u0101na \"One Vehicle\", the early Chan school was sometimes referred to as the \"One Vehicle School\". In other early texts, the school that would later become known as Chan is sometimes even referred to as simply the \"La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra school\" (Ch. \u695e\u4f3d\u5b97, L\u00e9ngqi\u00e9 Z\u014dng). Accounts recording the history of this early period are to be found in the Records of the La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra Masters (Chinese: \u695e\u4f3d\u5e2b\u8cc7\u8a18).\n\n\n==== Bodhidharma ====\n\nBodhidharma is recorded as having come into China during the time of Southern and Northern Dynasties to teach a \"special transmission outside scriptures\" which \"did not stand upon words\". Throughout Buddhist art, Bodhidharma is depicted as a rather ill-tempered, profusely bearded and wide-eyed barbarian. He is referred as \"The Blue-Eyed Barbarian\" (\u78a7\u773c\u80e1:B\u00ecy\u01cen h\u00fa) in Chinese Chan texts. Only scarce historical information is available about him but his hagiography developed when the Chan tradition grew stronger and gained prominence in the early 8th century. By this time a lineage of the six ancestral founders of Ch\u00e1n in China was developed.Little contemporary biographical information on Bodhidharma is extant, and subsequent accounts became layered with legend. There are three principal sources for Bodhidharma's biography: The Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang by Y\u00e1ng Xu\u00e0nzh\u012b's (\u694a\u8852\u4e4b, 547), Tan Lin's preface to the Long Scroll of the Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices (6th century CE), and Dayi Daoxin's Further Biographies of Eminent Monks (7th century CE).\nThese sources vary in their account of Bodhidharma being either \"from Persia\" (547 CE), \"a Brahman monk from South India\" (645 CE), \"the third son of a Brahman king of South India\" (c. 715 CE). Some traditions specifically describe Bodhidharma to be the third son of a Pallava king from Kanchipuram.The Long Scroll of the Treatise on the Two Entrances and Four Practices written by Tan Lin (\u66c7\u6797; 506\u2013574), contains teachings which are attributed to Bodhidharma. The text is known from the Dunhuang manuscripts. The two entrances to enlightenment are the entrance of principle and the entrance of practice:\n\nThe entrance of principle is to become enlightened to the Truth on the basis of the teaching. One must have a profound faith in the fact that one and the same True Nature is possessed by all sentient beings, both ordinary and enlightened, and that this True Nature is only covered up and made imperceptible [in the case of ordinary people] by false sense impressions\".\nThe entrance of practice includes the following four increments:\nPractice of the retribution of enmity: to accept all suffering as the fruition of past transgressions, without enmity or complaint\nPractice of the acceptance of circumstances: to remain unmoved even by good fortune, recognizing it as evanescent\nPractice of the absence of craving: to be without craving, which is the source of all suffering\nPractice of accordance with the Dharma: to eradicate wrong thoughts and practice the six perfections, without having any \"practice\".\nThis text was used and studied by Huike and his students. The True Nature refers to the Buddha-nature.\n\n\n==== Huike ====\nBodhidharma settled in Northern Wei China. Shortly before his death, Bodhidharma appointed his disciple Dazu Huike to succeed him, making Huike the first Chinese-born ancestral founder and the second ancestral founder of Chan in China. Bodhidharma is said to have passed three items to Huike as a sign of transmission of the Dharma: a robe, a bowl, and a copy of the La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra. The transmission then passed to the second ancestral founder Dazu Huike, the third Sengcan, the fourth ancestral founder Dayi Daoxin, and the fifth ancestral founder Daman Hongren.\n\n\n=== Early Chan in Tang China (c. 600\u2013900) ===\n\n\n==== East Mountain Teachings ====\nWith the fourth patriarch, Daoxin (\u9053\u4fe1 580\u2013651), Ch\u00e1n began to take shape as a distinct school. The link between Huike and Sengcan, and the fourth patriarch Daoxin \"is far from clear and remains tenuous\". With Daoxin and his successor, the fifth patriarch Hongren (\u5f18\u5fcd 601\u2013674), there emerged a new style of teaching, which was inspired by the Chinese text Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana. According to John R. McRae the \"first explicit statement of the sudden and direct approach that was to become the hallmark of Ch'an religious practice\" is associated with the East Mountain School. It is a method named \"Maintaining the one without wavering\" (shou-i pu i, \u5b88\u4e00\u4e0d\u79fb), the one being the nature of mind, which is equated with Buddha-nature. In this practice, one turns the attention from the objects of experience, to the perceiving subject itself. According to McRae, this type of meditation resembles the methods of \"virtually all schools of Mahayana Buddhism,\" but differs in that \"no preparatory requirements, no moral prerequisites or preliminary exercises are given,\" and is \"without steps or gradations. One concentrates, understands, and is enlightened, all in one undifferentiated practice.\" Sharf notes that the notion of \"Mind\" came to be criticised by radical subitists, and was replaced by \"No Mind,\" to avoid any reifications.A large group of students gathered at a permanent residence, and extreme ascetism became outdated. The period of Daoxin and Hongren came to be called the East Mountain Teaching, due to the location of the residence of Hongren at Huangmei. The term was used by Yuquan Shenxiu (\u795e\u79c0 606?\u2013706), the most important successor to Hongren. By this time the group had grown into a matured congregation which became significant enough to be reckoned with by the ruling forces. The East Mountain community was a specialized meditation training centre. Hongren was a plain meditation teacher, who taught students of \"various religious interests\", including \"practitioners of the Lotus Sutra, students of Madhyamaka philosophy, or specialists in the monastic regulations of Buddhist Vinaya\". The school was typified by a \"loose practice,\" aiming to make meditation accessible to a larger audience. Shenxiu used short formulas extracted from various sutras to package the teachings, a style which is also used in the Platform Sutra. The establishment of a community in one location was a change from the wandering lives of Bodhiharma and Huike and their followers. It fitted better into the Chinese society, which highly valued community-oriented behaviour, instead of solitary practice.In 701 Shenxiu was invited to the Imperial Court by Zhou Empress Wu Zetian, who paid him due imperial reverence. The first lineage documents were produced in this period:\n\n[T]he genealogical presentation of the Chan transmission was first recorded on paper in the early years of metropolitan Chan activity. The earliest recorded instance of this was in the epitaph for a certain Faru, a student of Hongren's who died in 689, and by the second decade of the 8th century, the later followers of Hongren had produced two separate texts describing the transmission from Bodhidharma to Shenxiu.\nThe transition from the East Mountain to the two capitals changed the character of Chan:\n\n[I]t was only when Hongren's successors moved into the environment of the two capitals, with its literate society and incomparably larger urban scale, that well-written texts were required for disseminating the teaching.Members of the \"East Mountain Teaching\" shifted the alleged scriptural basis, realizing that the Awakening of Faith is not a sutra but a sastra, commentary, and fabricated a lineage of Lankavatara Sutra masters, as being the sutra that preluded the Awakening of Faith.\n\n\n==== Southern School \u2013 Huineng and Shenhui ====\n\nAccording to tradition, the sixth and last ancestral founder, Huineng (\u60e0\u80fd; 638\u2013713), was one of the giants of Chan history, and all surviving schools regard him as their ancestor. The dramatic story of Huineng's life tells that there was a controversy over his claim to the title of patriarch. After being chosen by Hongren, the fifth ancestral founder, Huineng had to flee by night to Nanhua Temple in the south to avoid the wrath of Hongren's jealous senior disciples.\nModern scholarship, however, has questioned this narrative. Historic research reveals that this story was created around the middle of the 8th century, as part of a campaign to win influence at the Imperial Court in 731 by a successor to Huineng called Shenhui. He claimed Huineng to be the successor of Hongren instead of Shenxiu, the recognized successor. A dramatic story of Huineng's life was created, as narrated in the Platform Sutra, which tells that there was a contest for the transmission of the title of patriarch. After being chosen by Hongren, the fifth patriarch, Huineng had to flee by night to Nanhua Temple in the south to avoid the wrath of Hongren's jealous senior disciples. Shenhui succeeded in his campaign, and Huineng eventually came to be regarded as the Sixth Patriarch. In 745 Shenhui was invited to take up residence in the Heze Temple in the capital, Dongdu (modern Luoyang) In 753, he fell out of grace and had to leave Dongdu to go into exile.\nThe most prominent of the successors of Shenhui's lineage was Guifeng Zongmi. According to Zongmi, Shenhui's approach was officially sanctioned in 796, when \"an imperial commission determined that the Southern line of Ch'an represented the orthodox transmission and established Shen-hui as the seventh patriarch, placing an inscription to that effect in the Shen-lung temple\".Doctrinally, Shenhui's \"Southern School\" is associated with the teaching that enlightenment is sudden while the \"Northern\" or East Mountain school is associated with the teaching that enlightenment is gradual. This was a polemical exaggeration since both schools were derived from the same tradition, and the so-called Southern School incorporated many teachings of the more influential Northern School. Eventually both schools died out, but the influence of Shenhui was so immense that all later Chan schools traced their origin to Huineng, and \"sudden enlightenment\" became a standard doctrine of Chan.Shenhui's influence is traceable in the Platform Sutra, which gives a popular account of the story of Huineng but also reconciles the antagonism created by Shenhui. Salient is that Shenhui himself does not figure in the Platform Sutra; he was effectively written out of Chan history. The Platform Sutra also reflects the growing popularity of the Diamond S\u016btra (Vajracchedik\u0101 Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 S\u016btra) in 8th-century Chinese Buddhism. Thereafter, the essential texts of the Chan school were often considered to be both the La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra and the Diamond S\u016btra. The La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra, which endorses the Buddha-nature, emphasized purity of mind, which can be attained in gradations. The Diamond-sutra emphasizes sunyata, which \"must be realized totally or not at all\". David Kalupahana associates the later Caodong school (Japanese S\u014dt\u014d, gradual) and Linji school (Japanese Rinzai school, sudden) schools with the Yogacara and Madhyamaka philosophies respectively. The same comparison has been made by McRae. The Madhyamaka school elaborated on the theme of \u015b\u016bnyat\u0101, which was set forth in the prajnaparamita sutras, to which the Diamond Sutra also belongs. The shift from the La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra to the Diamond Sutra also signifies a tension between Buddha-nature teachings, which imply a transcendental reality, versus \u015b\u016bnyat\u0101, which denies such a transcendental reality.\n\n\n=== Tibetan Chan ===\nChinese Chan Buddhist teachers such as Moheyan first went to Tibet in the eighth century during the height of the Tibetan Empire. There seems to have been disputes between them and Indian Buddhists, as exemplified by the Samye debate. Many Tibetan Chan texts have been recovered from the caves at Dunhuang, where Chan and Tantric Buddhists lived side by side and this led to religious syncretism in some cases. Chan Buddhism survived in Tibet for several centuries, but had mostly been replaced by the 10th century developments in Tibetan Buddhism. According to Sam Van Schaik:\n\nAfter the 'dark period', all visible influences of Chan were eliminated from Tibetan Buddhism, and Mahayoga and Chan were carefully distinguished from each other. This trend\ncan already be observed in the tenth-century Lamp for the Eyes in Contemplation by the great central Tibetan scholar Gnubs chen Sangs rgyas ye shes. This influential work represented a crucial step in the codification of Chan, Mahayoga and the Great Perfection as distinct vehicles to enlightenment. In comparison, our group of [Dunhuang] manuscripts exhibits a remarkable freedom, blurring the lines between meditation systems which were elsewhere kept quite distinct. The system of practice set out in these manuscripts did not survive into the later Tibetan tradition. Indeed, this creative integration of meditation practices derived from both Indic and Chinese traditions could only have been possible during the earliest years of Tibetan Buddhism, when doctrinal categories were still forming, and in this sense it represents an important stage in the Tibetan assimilation of Buddhism.\n\n\n=== Classical or Middle Chan \u2013 Tang dynasty (c. 750\u20131000) ===\nDaoxin, Hongren, Shenxiu, Huineng and Shenhui all lived during the early Tang. The later period of the Tang Dynasty is traditionally regarded as the \"golden age\" of Chan. This proliferation is described in a famous saying:\nLook at the territory of the house of Tang \u2014The whole of it is the realm of the Chan school.\n\n\n==== An Lu-shan rebellion ====\nThe An Lushan Rebellion (755\u2013763) led to a loss of control by the Tang dynasty, and changed the Chan scene again. Metropolitan Chan began to lose its status, while \"other schools were arising in outlying areas controlled by warlords. These are the forerunners of the Chan we know today. Their origins are obscure; the power of Shen-hui's preaching is shown by the fact that they all trace themselves to Hui-neng.\"\n\n\n==== Hung-chou School ====\n\nThe most important of these schools is the Hongzhou school (\u6d2a\u5dde\u5b97) of Mazu, to which also belong Shitou, Baizhang Huaihai, Huangbo and Linji (Rinzai). Linji is also regarded as the founder of one of the Five Houses.\nThis school developed \"shock techniques such as shouting, beating, and using irrational retorts to startle their students into realization\". Some of these are common today, while others are found mostly in anecdotes. It is common in many Chan traditions today for Chan teachers to have a stick with them during formal ceremonies which is a symbol of authority and which can be also used to strike on the table during a talk.\nThese shock techniques became part of the traditional and still popular image of Chan masters displaying irrational and strange behaviour to aid their students. Part of this image was due to later misinterpretations and translation errors, such as the loud belly shout known as katsu. \"Katsu\" means \"to shout\", which has traditionally been translated as \"yelled 'katsu'\" \u2013 which should mean \"yelled a yell\".A well-known story depicts Mazu practicing dhyana, but being rebuked by his teacher Nanyue Huairang, comparing seated meditation with polishing a tile. According to Faure, the criticism is not about dhyana as such, but \"the idea of \"becoming a Buddha\" by means of any practice, lowered to the standing of a \"means\" to achieve an \"end\"\". The criticism of seated dhyana reflects a change in the role and position of monks in Tang society, who \"undertook only pious works, reciting sacred texts and remaining seated in dhyana\". Nevertheless, seated dhyana remained an important part of the Chan tradition, also due to the influence of Guifeng Zongmi, who tried to balance dhyana and insight.The Hung-chou school has been criticised for its radical subitism. Guifeng Zongmi (\u572d\u5cf0 \u5b97\u5bc6) (780\u2013841), an influential teacher-scholar and patriarch of both the Chan and the Huayan school, claimed that the Hongzhou school teaching led to a radical nondualism that denies the need for spiritual cultivation and moral discipline. While Zongmi acknowledged that the essence of Buddha-nature and its functioning in the day-to-day reality are but difference aspects of the same reality, he insisted that there is a difference.\n\n\n==== Shitou Xiqian ====\nTraditionally Sh\u00edt\u00f3u X\u012bqi\u0101n (Ch. \u77f3\u982d\u5e0c\u9077, c. 700 \u2013 c.790) is seen as the other great figure of this period. In the Chan lineages he is regarded as the predecessor of the Caodong (S\u014dt\u014d) school. He is also regarded as the author of the Sandokai, a poem which formed the basis for the Song of the Precious Mirror Samadhi of Dongshan Liangjie (Jp. T\u014dzan Ry\u014dkan) and the teaching of the Five Ranks.\n\n\n==== The Great Persecution ====\nDuring 845\u2013846 Emperor Wuzong persecuted the Buddhist schools in China:\n\nIt was a desperate attempt on the part of the hard-pressed central government, which had been in disarray since the An Lu-shan rebellion of 756, to gain some measure of political, economic, and military relief by preying on the Buddhist temples with their immense wealth and extensive lands.\nThis persecution was devastating for metropolitan Chan, but the Chan school of Ma-tsu and his likes survived, and took a leading role in the Chan of the later Tang.\n\n\n==== Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period (907\u2013960/979) ====\n\nAfter the fall of the Tang Dynasty, China was without effective central control during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period. China was divided into several autonomous regions. Support for Buddhism was limited to a few areas. The Hua-yen and T'ient-tai schools suffered from the changing circumstances, since they had depended on imperial support. The collapse of T'ang society also deprived the aristocratic classes of wealth and influence, which meant a further drawback for Buddhism. Shenxiu's Northern School and Henshui's Southern School didn't survive the changing circumstances. Nevertheless, Chan emerged as the dominant stream within Chinese Buddhism, but with various schools developing various emphasises in their teachings, due to the regional orientation of the period. The Fayan school, named after Fa-yen Wen-i (885\u2013958) became the dominant school in the southern kingdoms of Nan-T'ang (Jiangxi, Chiang-hsi) and Wuyue (Che-chiang).\n\n\n=== Literary Chan \u2013 Song dynasty (c. 960\u20131300) ===\n\nThe Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period was followed by the Song Dynasty, which established a strong central government. During the Song Dynasty, Chan (\u79aa) was used by the government to strengthen its control over the country, and Chan grew to become the largest sect in Chinese Buddhism. An ideal picture of the Chan of the Tang period was produced, which served the legacy of this newly acquired status:\n\nIn the Song dynasty (960\u20131279), Chinese Chan Buddhism reached something of a climax paradigm. By \"climax paradigm\", I mean a conceptual configuration by which Chan was described in written texts, practiced by its adherents, and by extension understood as a religious entity by the Chinese population as a whole ... Previous events in Chan were interpreted through the lens of the Song dynasty configuration, and subsequent developments in China, Korea, Japan, and Vietnam were evaluated, even as they occurred, against what was known of the standards established during the Song. Thus the romanticized image of the great Tang dynasty masters \u2013 Mazu and his students, Caoshan, Dongshan, and their students, and of course Linji \u2013 was generated by Song dynasty authors and functioned within Song dynasty texts. Similarly, even where subsequent figures throughout East Asia \u2013 Hakuin Ekaku (1685\u20131769), the famous reviver of Japanese Rinzai, is the best example \u2013 evoke the examples of Bodhidharma, the Sixth Patriarch Huineng, Mazu, and the others, they do so through the conceptual filter of Song-dynasty Chan.\n\n\n==== Five Houses of Chan ====\n\nDuring the Song the Five Houses (Ch. \u4e94\u5bb6) of Chan, or five \"schools\", were recognized. These were not originally regarded as \"schools\" or \"sects\", but based on the various Chan-genealogies. Historically they have come to be understood as \"schools\".\nThe Five Houses of Chan are:\nGuiyang school (\u6f59\u4ef0\u5b97), named after masters Guishan Lingyou (771\u2013854) and Yangshan Huiji (813\u2013890), dharma-descendants of Mazu Daoyi;\nLinji school (\u81e8\u6fdf\u5b97), named after master Linji Yixuan (died 866), whose lineage came to be traced to Mazu, establishing him as the archetypal iconoclastic Chan-master;\nCaodong school (\u66f9\u6d1e\u5b97), named after masters Dongshan Liangjie (807\u2013869) and Caoshan Benji (840\u2013901);\nYunmen school (\u96f2\u9580\u5b97), named after master Yunmen Wenyan (died 949), a student of Xuefeng Yicun (822\u2013908), whose lineage was traced to Shitou Xiqian:\nFayan school (\u6cd5\u773c\u5b97), named after master Fayan Wenyi (885\u2013958), a \"grand-student\" of Xuefeng Yicun.\n\n\n==== Rise of the Linji-school ====\n\nThe Linji-school became the dominant school within Chan, due to support from literati and the court. Before the Song Dynasty, the Linji-school is rather obscure, and very little is known about its early history. The first mention of Linji is in the Zutang ji, compiled in 952, 86 years after Linji's death. But the Zutang ji pictures the Xuefeng Yicun lineage as heir to the legacy of Mazu and the Hongzhou-school.According to Welter, the real founder of the Linji-school was Shoushan (or Baoying) Shengnian (\u9996\u5c71\u7701\u5ff5) (926\u2013993), a fourth generation dharma-heir of Linji. The Tiansheng Guangdeng lu (\u5929\u8056\u5ee3\u71c8\u9304), \"Tiansheng Era Expanded Lamp Record\", compiled by the official Li Zunxu (\u674e\u9075\u52d7) (988\u20131038) confirms the status of Shoushan Shengnian, but also pictures Linji as a major Chan patriarch and heir to the Mazu, displacing the prominence of the Fayan-lineage. It also established the slogan of \"a special transmission outside the teaching\", supporting the Linji-school claim of \"Chan as separate from and superior to all other Buddhist teachings\".\n\n\n==== Dahui Zonggao ====\nOver the course of Song Dynasty (960\u20131279), the Guiyang, Fayan, and Yunmen schools were gradually absorbed into the Linji. Song Chan was dominated by the Linji school of Dahui Zonggao, which in turn became strongly affiliated to the Imperial Court:\n\n... the Ta-hui school of Sung Chan had become closely associated with the Sung court, high officials, and the literati [...] With the establishment of the Wu-shan (Gozan) system during the Southern Sung the school of Ta-hui took precedence. The Chinese bureaucratic system entered into Chan temples throughout the country, and a highly organized system of temple rank and administration developed.\nThe Gozan system was a system of state-controlled temples, which were established by the Song government in all provinces.\n\n\n==== Koan-system ====\nThe teaching styles and words of the classical masters were recorded in the so-called \"encounter dialogues\". Snippets of these encounter dialogues were collected in texts as the Blue Cliff Record (1125) of Yuanwu, The Gateless Gate (1228) of Wumen, both of the Linji lineage, and the Book of Equanimity (1223) by Wansong Xingxiu of the Caodong lineage.\nThese texts became classic g\u014dng'\u00e0n cases, together with verse and prose commentaries, which crystallized into the systematized g\u014dng'\u00e0n (koan) practice. According to Miura and Sasaki, \"[I]t was during the lifetime of Y\u00fcan-wu's successor, Dahui Zonggao (\u5927\u6167\u5b97\u6772; 1089\u20131163) that Koan Chan entered its determinative stage.\"\nG\u014dng'\u00e0n practice was prevalent in the Linji school, to which Yuanwu and Dahui belonged, but it was also employed on a more limited basis by the Caodong school.\nThe recorded encounter dialogues, and the koan collections which derived from this genre, mark a shift from solitary practice to interaction between master and student:\n\nThe essence of enlightenment came to be identified with the interaction between masters and students. Whatever insight dhyana might bring, its verification was always interpersonal. In effect, enlightenment came to be understood not so much as an insight, but as a way of acting in the world with other people\nThis mutual enquiry of the meaning of the encounters of masters and students of the past gave students a role model:\n\nOne looked at the enlightened activities of one's lineal forebears in order to understand one's own identity [...] taking the role of the participants and engaging in their dialogues instead\nKoan practice was a literary practice, styling snippets of encounter-dialogue into well-edited stories. It arose in interaction with \"educated literati\". There were dangers involved in such a literary approach, such as fixing specific meanings to the cases. Dahui Zonggao is even said to have burned the woodblocks of the Blue Cliff Record, for the hindrance it had become to study of Chan by his students\n\n\n==== Silent illumination ====\nThe Caodong was the other school to survive into the Song period. Its main protagonist was Hung-chih Cheng-chueh, a contemporary of Dahui Zonggao. It put emphasis on \"silent illumination\", or \"just sitting\". This approach was attacked by Dahui as being mere passivity, and lacking emphasis on gaining insight into one's true nature. Cheng-chueh in his turn criticized the emphasis on koan study.\n\n\n=== Post-classical Chan (c. 1300\u2013present) ===\n\n\n==== Yuan Dynasty (1279\u20131368) ====\nThe Yuan dynasty was the empire established by Kublai Khan, the leader of the Borjigin clan, after the Mongol Empire conquered the Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234) and the Southern Song Dynasty. Chan began to be mixed with Pure Land Buddhism as in the teachings of Zhongfeng Mingben (1263\u20131323).\n\n\n==== Ming dynasty (1368\u20131644) ====\nChan Buddhism enjoyed something of a revival in the Ming dynasty, with teachers such as Hanshan Deqing (\u61a8\u5c71\u5fb7\u6e05), who wrote and taught extensively on both Chan and Pure Land Buddhism; Miyun Yuanwu (\u5bc6\u96f2\u5713\u609f), who came to be seen posthumously as the first patriarch of the \u014cbaku school of Zen; and as Yunqi Zhuhong (\u96f2\u68f2\u7969\u5b8f) and Ouyi Zhixu (\u8545\u76ca\u667a\u65ed).\nChan was taught alongside Pure Land Buddhism in many monasteries. In time much of the distinction between them was lost, and many masters taught both Chan and Pure Land.With the downfall of the Ming, several Chan masters fled to Japan, founding the \u014cbaku school.\n\n\n==== Qing Dynasty (1644\u20131912) ====\nIn the beginning of the Qing dynasty, Chan was \"reinvented\", by the \"revival of beating and shouting practices\" by Miyun Yuanwu (1566\u20131642), and the publication of the Wudeng yantong (\"The strict transmission of the five Chan schools\") by Feiyin Tongrong's (1593\u20131662), a dharma heir of Miyun Yuanwu. The book placed self-proclaimed Chan monks without proper Dharma transmission in the category of \"lineage unknown\" (sifa weixiang), thereby excluding several prominent Caodong monks.\n\n\n=== Modernisation ===\n\n\n==== 19th century (late Qing Dynasty) ====\nAround 1900, Buddhists from other Asian countries showed a growing interest in Chinese Buddhism. Anagarika Dharmapala visited Shaghai in 1893, intending \"to make a tour of China, to arouse the Chinese Buddhists to send missionaries to India to restore Buddhism there, and then to start a propaganda throughout the whole world\", but eventually limiting his stay to Shanghai. Japanese Buddhist missionaries were active in China in the beginning of the 20th century.\n\n\n==== Republic of China (1912\u20131949) \u2013 First Buddhist Revival ====\n\nThe modernisation of China led to the end of the Chinese Empire, and the installation of the Republic of China, which lasted on the mainland until the Communist Revolution and the installation of the People's Republic of China in 1949.\nAfter further centuries of decline during the Qing, Chan was revived again in the early 20th century by Hsu Yun (\u865b\u96f2), a well-known figure of 20th-century Chinese Buddhism. Many Chan teachers today trace their lineage to Hsu Yun, including Sheng Yen (\u8056\u56b4) and Hsuan Hua (\u5ba3\u5316), who have propagated Chan in the West where it has grown steadily through the 20th and 21st century.\nThe Buddhist reformist Taixu propagated a Chan-influenced humanistic Buddhism, which is endorsed by Jing Hui, former abbott of Bailin Monastery.Until 1949, monasteries were built in the Southeast Asian countries, for example by monks of Guanghua Monastery, to spread Chinese Buddhism. Presently, Guanghua Monastery has seven branches in the Malay Peninsula and Indonesia.\n\n\n==== People's Republic of China (1949\u2013present) \u2013 Second Buddhist Revival ====\n\nChan was repressed in China during the recent modern era in the early periods of the People's Republic, but subsequently had been re-asserting itself on the mainland, and has a significant following in Taiwan and Hong Kong as well as among Overseas Chinese.\nSince the Chinese economic reform of the 1970s, a new revival of Chinese Buddhism is going on. Ancient Buddhist temples, such as Bailin Monastery and Guanghua Monastery have been refurbished.\nBailin Monastery was ruined long before 1949. In 1988, Jing Hui was persuaded to take over the Hebei Buddhist Association, and start rebuilding the Monastery. Jing Hui is a student and dharma successor of Hsu Yun, but has also adopted the Humanistic Buddhism of Taixu.Guanghua Monastery was restored beginning in 1979, when a six-year restoration program began under the supervision of then 70-year-old Venerable Master Yuanzhou (\u5706\u62d9\u8001\u6cd5\u5e08). In 1983 the temple became one of the Chinese Buddhism Regional Temples (\u6c49\u65cf\u5730\u533a\u5168\u56fd\u91cd\u70b9\u5bfa\u9662) whilst 36-year-old Master Yiran (\u6bc5\u7136\u6cd5\u5e2b) became abbot. The same year, Venerable Master Yuanzhou funded the establishment of the new Fujian Buddhism Academy (\u798f\u5efa\u4f5b\u5b66\u9662) on the site.\n\n\n==== Taiwan ====\n\nSeveral Chinese Buddhist teachers left China during the Communist Revolution, and settled in Hong Kong and Taiwan.\nSheng Yen (1930\u20132009) was the founder of the Dharma Drum Mountain, a Buddhist organization based in Taiwan. During his time in Taiwan, Sheng Yen was well known as one of the progressive Buddhist teachers who sought to teach Buddhism in a modern and Western-influenced world. As such, Sheng yen published over 30 Chan texts in English.Wei Chueh (1928\u20132016) was born in Sichuan, China, and ordained in Taiwan. In 1982, he founded Lin Quan Temple in Taipei County and became known for his teaching on Ch'an practices by offering many lectures and seven-day Ch'an retreats. His order is called Chung Tai Shan.\nTwo additional traditions emerged in the 1960s, based their teaching on Ch'an practices.\nCheng Yen (born 1937), a Buddhist nun, founded the Tzu Chi Foundation as a charity organization with Buddhist origins on 14 May 1966 in Hualien, Taiwan. She was inspired by her master and mentor, the late Venerable Master Yin Shun (\u5370\u9806\u5c0e\u5e2b, Y\u00ecn Sh\u00f9n d\u01ceosh\u012b) a proponent of Humanistic Buddhism, who exhorted her to \"work for Buddhism and for all sentient beings\". The organisation began with a motto of \"instructing the rich and saving the poor\" as a group of thirty housewives who donated a small amount of money each day to care for needy families.Hsing Yun (born 1927), founded the Fo Guang Shan an international Chinese Buddhist new religious movement based in Taiwan in 1967. The order promotes Humanistic Buddhism. Fo Guang Shan also calls itself the International Buddhist Progress Society.  The headquarters of Fo Guang Shan, located in Dashu District, Kaohsiung, is the largest Buddhist monastery in Taiwan. Hsing Yun's stated position within Fo Guang Shan is that it is an \"amalgam of all Eight Schools of Chinese Buddhism\" (\u516b\u5b97\u517c\u5f18), including Chan. Fo Guang Shan is the most comprehensive of the major Buddhist organizations of Taiwan, focusing extensively on both social works and religious engagement.In Taiwan, these four masters are popularly referred to as the \"Four Heavenly Kings\" of Taiwanese Buddhism, with their respective organizations Dharma Drum Mountain, Chung Tai Shan, Tzu Chi, and Fo Guang Shan being referred to as the \"Four Great Mountains\".\n\n\n== Spread of Chan Buddhism in Asia ==\n\n\n=== Thi\u1ec1n in Vietnam ===\n\nAccording to traditional accounts of Vietnam, in 580 an Indian monk named Vin\u012btaruci (Vietnamese: T\u00ec-ni-\u0111a-l\u01b0u-chi) travelled to Vietnam after completing his studies with Sengcan, the third patriarch of Chinese Chan. This, then, would be the first appearance of Thi\u1ec1n Buddhism. Other early Thi\u1ec1n schools included that of Wu Yantong (Chinese: \u7121\u8a00\u901a; Vietnamese: V\u00f4 Ng\u00f4n Th\u00f4ng), which was associated with the teachings of Mazu Daoyi, and the Th\u1ea3o \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng (Caodong), which incorporated nianfo chanting techniques; both were founded by Chinese monks.\n\n\n=== Seon in Korea ===\n\nSeon was gradually transmitted into Korea during the late Silla period (7th through 9th centuries) as Korean monks of predominantly Hwaeom (Korean: \ud654\uc5c4\uc885; Hanja: \u83ef\u56b4\u5b97) and East Asian Yog\u0101c\u0101ra (Korean: \uc720\uc2dd\uc885; Hanja: \u552f\u8b58\u5b97) background began to travel to China to learn the newly developing tradition. Seon received its most significant impetus and consolidation from the Goryeo monk Jinul (\u77e5\u8a25) (1158\u20131210), who established a reform movement and introduced k\u014dan practice to Korea. Jinul established the Songgwangsa (\u677e\u5ee3\u5bfa) as a new center of pure practice.\n\n\n=== Zen in Japan ===\n\nZen was not introduced as a separate school in Japan until the 12th century when Eisai traveled to China and returned to establish a Linji lineage, which is known in Japan as the Rinzai. In 1215, D\u014dgen, a younger contemporary of Eisai's, journeyed to China himself, where he became a disciple of the Caodong master Rujing. After his return, D\u014dgen established the S\u014dt\u014d school, the Japanese branch of Caodong.\nThe schools of Zen that currently exist in Japan are the S\u014dt\u014d, Rinzai and \u014cbaku. Of these, S\u014dt\u014d is the largest and \u014cbaku the smallest. Rinzai is itself divided into several subschools based on temple affiliation, including My\u014dshin-ji, Nanzen-ji, Tenry\u016b-ji, Daitoku-ji, and T\u014dfuku-ji.\n\n\n=== Chan in Indonesia ===\n\nIn the 20th century, during the First Buddhist revival, missionaries were sent to Indonesia and Malaysia. Ashin Jinarakkhita, who played a central role in the revival of Indonesian Buddhism, received ordination as a Chan \u015br\u0101ma\u1e47era on July 29, 1953 and received the name Ti Zheng (Te Cheng) from bhik\u1e63u Ben Qing.\n\n\n== Chan in the Western world ==\n\nChan has become especially popular in its Japanese form. Although it is difficult to trace when the West first became aware of Chan as a distinct form of Buddhism, the visit of Soyen Shaku, a Japanese Zen monk, to Chicago during the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions is often pointed to as an event that enhanced its profile in the Western world. It was during the late 1950s and the early 1960s that the number of Westerners pursuing a serious interest in Zen, other than the descendants of Asian immigrants, reached a significant level.\n\n\n=== Western Chan lineages ===\n\nThe first Chinese master to teach Westerners in North America was Hsuan Hua, who taught Chan and other traditions of Chinese Buddhism in San Francisco during the early 1960s. He went on to found the City Of Ten Thousand Buddhas, a monastery and retreat center located on a 237-acre (959,000 m\u00b2) property near Ukiah, California, founding the Dharma Realm Buddhist Association. Another Chinese Chan teacher with a Western following was Sheng Yen, a master trained in both the Caodong and Linji schools. He first visited the United States in 1978 under the sponsorship of the Buddhist Association of the United States, and subsequently founded the CMC Chan Meditation Center in Queens, New York and the Dharma Drum Retreat Center in Pine Bush, New York.\n\n\n== Doctrinal background ==\n\nThough Zen-narrative states that it is a \"special transmission outside scriptures\" which \"did not stand upon words\", Zen does have a rich doctrinal background.\n\n\n=== Polarities ===\nClassical Chinese Chan is characterised by a set of polarities: absolute-relative, Buddha-nature \u2013 sunyata, sudden and gradual enlightenment, esoteric and exoteric transmission.\n\n\n==== Absolute-relative ====\nThe Prajnaparamita sutras and Madhyamaka emphasize the non-duality of form and emptiness: \"form is emptiness, emptiness is form\", as the Heart sutra says. This was understood to mean that ultimate reality is not a transcendental realm, but equal to the daily world of relative reality. This idea fitted into the Chinese culture, which emphasized the mundane world and society. But this does not fully explain how the absolute is present in the relative world. This question is answered in such schemata as the Five Ranks of Tozan, the Ten Bulls (\"the Oxherding Pictures\"), and Hakuin's Four ways of knowing.The Madhyamaka two truths doctrine and the Yogacara three natures and Trikaya doctrines also give depictions of the interplay between the absolute and the relative.\n\n\n==== Buddha-nature and \u015b\u016bnyat\u0101 ====\nWhen Buddhism was introduced in China it was understood in native terms. Various sects struggled to attain an understanding of the Indian texts. The Tath\u0101gatagarbha s\u016btras and the idea of the Buddha-nature were endorsed because of the perceived similarities with the Tao, which was understood as a transcendental reality underlying the world of appearances. \u015a\u016bnyat\u0101 at first was understood as pointing to the Taoist wu.The doctrine of the Buddha-nature asserts that all sentient beings have Buddha-nature (Skt. Buddhadh\u0101tu, \"Buddha Element\", \"Buddha-Principle\"), the element from which awakening springs. The Tath\u0101gatagarbha sutras state that every living being has the potential to realize awakening. Hence Buddhism offers salvation to every-one, not only to monks or those who have freed themselves almost completely from karma in previous lives. The Yogacara theory of the Eight Consciousnesses explains how sensory input and the mind create the world we experience, and obscure the alaya-jnana, which is equated to the Buddha-nature.When this potential is realized, and the defilements have been eliminated, the Buddha-nature manifests as the Dharmakaya, the absolute reality which pervades everything in the world. In this way, it is also the primordial reality from which phenomenal reality springs. When this understanding is idealized, it becomes a transcendental reality beneath the world of appearances.Sunyata points to the \"emptiness\" or no-\"thing\"-ness of all \"things\". Though we perceive a world of concrete and discrete objects, designated by names, on close analysis the \"thingness\" dissolves, leaving them \"empty\" of inherent existence. The Heart sutra, a text from the praj\u00f1aparamita sutras, articulates this in the following saying in which the five skandhas are said to be \"empty\":\nYogacara explains this \"emptiness\" in an analysis of the way we perceive \"things\". Everything we conceive of is the result of the working of the five skandhas\u2014results of perception, feeling, volition, and discrimination. The five skandhas together compose consciousness. The \"things\" we are conscious of are \"mere concepts\", not noumenon.It took Chinese Buddhism several centuries to recognize that \u015b\u016bnyat\u0101 is not identical to \"wu\", nor does Buddhism postulate a permanent soul. The influence of those various doctrinal and textual backgrounds is still discernible in Zen. Zen teachers still refer to Buddha-nature, but the Zen tradition also emphasizes that Buddha-nature is \u015b\u016bnyat\u0101, the absence of an independent and substantial self.\n\n\n==== Sudden and gradual enlightenment ====\n\nIn Zen Buddhism two main views on the way to enlightenment are discernible, namely sudden and gradual enlightenment.\nEarly Chan recognized the \"transcendence of the body and mind\", followed by \"non-defilement [of] knowledge and perception\", or sudden insight into the true nature (ji\u00e0nx\u00ecng) followed by gradual purification of intentions.In the 8th century Chan history was effectively refashioned by Shenhui, who created a dichotomy between the so-called East Mountain Teaching or \"Northern School\", led by Yuquan Shenxiu, and his own line of teaching, which he called the \"Southern school\". Shenhui placed Huineng into prominence as the sixth Chan-patriarch, and emphasized sudden enlightenment, as opposed to the concurrent Northern School's alleged gradual enlightenment. According to the sudden enlightenment propagated by Shenhui, insight into true nature is sudden; thereafter there can be no misunderstanding anymore about this true nature.\nIn the Platform Sutra, the dichotomy between sudden and gradual is reconciled. Guifeng Zongmi, fifth-generation successor to Shenhui, also softened the edge between sudden and gradual. In his analysis, sudden awakening points to seeing into one's true nature, but is to be followed by a gradual cultivation to attain Buddhahood.This gradual cultivation is also recognized by Dongshan Liangjie (Japanese T\u014dzan), who described the five ranks of enlightenment.\n\n\n==== Esoteric and exoteric transmission ====\nAccording to Borup the emphasis on 'mind to mind transmission' is a form of esoteric transmission, in which \"the tradition and the enlightened mind is transmitted face to face\". Metaphorically this can be described as the transmission from a flame from one candle to another candle, or the transmission from one vein to another. In exoteric transmission requires \"direct access to the teaching through a personal discovery of one's self. This type of transmission and identification is symbolized by the discovery of a shining lantern, or a mirror.\"\n\n\n=== Chan scripture ===\n\nChan is deeply rooted in the teachings and doctrines of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism. What the Chan tradition emphasizes is that enlightenment of the Buddha came not through intellectual reasoning, but rather through self-realization in Dharma practice and meditation. Therefore, it is held that it is primarily through Dharma practice and meditation that others may attain enlightenment and become Buddhas as well.\nA review of the early historical documents and literature of early Chan masters clearly reveals that they were all well versed in numerous Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhist s\u016btras. For example, in the Platform S\u016btra of the Sixth Patriarch, Huineng cites and explains the Diamond S\u016btra, the Lotus S\u016btra (Saddharma Pu\u1e47\u1e0dar\u012bka S\u016btra), the Vimalak\u012brti Nirde\u015ba S\u016btra, the \u015a\u016bra\u1e45gama S\u016btra, and the La\u1e45k\u0101vat\u0101ra S\u016btra.\nThe Chan school had to develop a doctrinal tradition of its own to establish its position. Subsequently, the Chan tradition produced a rich corpus of written literature which has become a part of its practice and teaching. Among the earliest and most widely studied of the specifically Chan texts, dating to at least the 9th century CE, is the Platform S\u016btra of the Sixth Patriarch, attributed to Huineng. The most important Chan texts belong to the \"encounter dialogue\" genre, which developed into various collections of k\u014dans.\n\n\n== Teaching and practice ==\nSee also Zen practice\n\n\n=== Bodhisattva ideal ===\nAs a school of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, Chan draws many of its basic driving concepts from that tradition, such as the Bodhisattva ideal. Karu\u1e47\u0101 is the counterpart of prajna. Avalokite\u015bvara embodies the striving for Karuna, compassion.Central to Chan practice is dhyana or meditation. In the Lin-ji (Rinzai) school this is supplemented with koan study.\n\n\n=== Chan meditation ===\nIn meditation practice, the Chan tradition holds that the very notions of doctrine and teachings create various other notions and appearances (Skt. sa\u1e43j\u00f1\u0101; Ch. \u76f8, xi\u0101ng) that obscure the transcendent wisdom of each being's Buddha-nature. Thus, Chan encourages its practitioners to distrust the very scripture or text being taught to them. The process of rediscovery goes under various terms such as \"introspection\", \"a backward step\", \"turning-about\" or \"turning the eye inward\".\n\n\n==== Sitting meditation ====\n\nSitting meditation is called zu\u00f2ch\u00e1n (\u5750\u7985), zazen in Japanese, both simply meaning \"sitting dhy\u0101na\". During this sitting meditation, practitioners usually assume a position such as the lotus position, half-lotus, Burmese, or seiza postures. To regulate the mind, awareness is directed towards counting or watching the breath, or put in the energy center below the navel (see also anapanasati). Often, a square or round cushion placed on a padded mat is used to sit on; in some other cases, a chair may be used.\nAt the beginning of the Song Dynasty, practice with the koan method became popular, whereas others practiced \"silent illumination.\" This became the source of some differences in practice between the Linji and Caodong traditions.\n\n\n=== Koan practice ===\n\nA koan (literally \"public case\") is a story or dialogue, generally related to Chan or other Buddhist history; the most typical form is an anecdote involving early Chinese Chan masters. These anecdotes involving famous Chan teachers are a practical demonstration of their wisdom, and can be used to test a student's progress in Chan practice. Koans often appear to be paradoxical or linguistically meaningless dialogues or questions. But to Chan Buddhists the koan is \"the place and the time and the event where truth reveals itself\" unobstructed by the oppositions and differentiations of language. Answering a koan requires a student to let go of conceptual thinking and of the logical way we order the world, so that, like creativity in art, the appropriate insight and response arises naturally and spontaneously in the mind.\n\n\n== Chan monasticism ==\nChan developed a distinct monastic system.\n\n\n=== Emphasizing daily life ===\nAs the Chan school grew in China, the monastic discipline also became distinct, focusing on practice through all aspects of life. Temples began emphasizing labor and humility, expanding the training of Chan to include the mundane tasks of daily life. D.T. Suzuki wrote that aspects of this life are: a life of humility; a life of labor; a life of service; a life of prayer and gratitude; and a life of meditation. The Chinese Chan master Baizhang (720\u2013814 CE) left behind a famous saying which had been the guiding principle of his life, \"A day without work is a day without food\".\n\n\n=== Sinification of Buddhism in China ===\nIt was scholar D.T. Suzuki's contention that a spiritual awakening was always the goal of Chan's training, but that part of what distinguished the tradition as it developed through the centuries in China was a way of life radically different from that of Indian Buddhists. In Indian Buddhism, the tradition of the mendicant prevailed, but Suzuki explained that in China social circumstances led to the development of a temple and training-center system in which the abbot and the monks all performed mundane tasks. These included food gardening or farming, carpentry, architecture, housekeeping, administration (or community direction), and the practice of Traditional Chinese medicine. Consequently, the enlightenment sought in Chan had to stand up well to the demands and potential frustrations of everyday life.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBuddhism\nOutline of Buddhism\nTimeline of Buddhism\nList of Buddhists\nChinese Buddhism\nJapanese Zen\nYiduan\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n=== Printed sources ===\n\n\n=== Web-sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nModern classics\n\nD.T.

After Smith's death in 1844 the movement split into several groups following different leaders; the majority followed Brigham Young, while smaller groups followed Joseph Smith III, Sidney Rigdon, and James Strang. Most of these smaller groups eventually coalesced into the Community of Christ, and the term Mormon typically refers to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), as today this branch is far larger than all the others combined. (Since 2018, the LDS Church has requested that its members be referred to as \"Latter-day Saints\".) People who identify as Mormons may also be independently religious, secular and non-practicing, or belong to other denominations.\nMormons have developed a strong sense of community that stems from their doctrine and history. One of the central doctrinal issues that defined Mormonism in the 19th century was the practice of plural marriage, a form of religious polygamy. From 1852 until 1904, when the LDS Church banned the practice, many Mormons who had followed Brigham Young to the Utah Territory openly practiced polygamy.  Mormons dedicate significant time and resources to serving in their churches. A prominent practice among young and retired members of the LDS Church is to serve a full-time proselytizing mission. Mormons have a health code which eschews alcoholic beverages, tobacco, tea, coffee, and addictive substances. They tend to be very family-oriented and have strong connections across generations and with extended family, reflective of their belief that families can be sealed together beyond death. They also have a strict law of chastity, requiring abstention from sexual relations outside heterosexual marriage and fidelity within marriage, though the Community of Christ is accepting of LGBTQ individuals and relationships. \nMormons self-identify as Christian, but some non-Mormons consider Mormons to be non-Christian because some of their beliefs differ from those of Nicene Christianity. Mormons believe that Christ's church was restored through Joseph Smith and is guided by living prophets and apostles. Mormons believe in the Bible, as well as other books of scripture, such as the Book of Mormon. They have a unique view of cosmology and believe that all people are literal spirit-children of God. Mormons believe that returning to God requires following the example of Jesus Christ, and accepting his atonement through repentance and ordinances such as baptism.\nDuring the 19th century, Mormon converts tended to gather to a central geographic location, a trend that reversed somewhat in the 1920s and 30s. The center of Mormon cultural influence is in Utah, and North America has more Mormons than any other continent, although the majority of Mormons live outside the United States. As of December 2020, the LDS Church reported having 16,663,663 members worldwide.\n\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe word Mormon was originally coined to describe any person who believes in the Book of Mormon as a volume of scripture. The term Mormonite and Mormon were originally descriptive terms used by outsiders to the faith and occasionally used by church leaders. The term Mormon later evolved into a derogatory term, likely during the 1838 Mormon War, although the term was later adopted by Joseph Smith.Today, while the term Mormonism can act as a blanket term for all sects following the religious tradition started by Joseph Smith, many sects do not prefer the term Mormon as an acceptable label. For example, the largest sect, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, based in Salt Lake City, recently clarified in a style guide that it prefers the term Latter-day Saints among other acceptable terms. The term preferred by the Salt Lake-based LDS church has varied in the past, and at various points it has embraced the term Mormon and also stated that other sects within the shared faith tradition should not be called Mormon. The second largest sect, the Community of Christ, also rejects the term Mormon due to its association with the practice of polygamy among Brighamite sects. Other sects, including several fundamentalist branches of the Brighamite tradition, embrace the term Mormon.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe history of the Mormons has shaped them into a people with a strong sense of unity and commonality. From the start, Mormons have tried to establish what they call \"Zion\", a utopian society of the righteous.\nMormon history can be divided into three broad time periods: (1) the early history during the lifetime of Joseph Smith, (2) a \"pioneer era\" under the leadership of Brigham Young and his successors, and (3) a modern era beginning around the turn of the 20th century. In the first period, Smith attempted to build a city called Zion, in which converts could gather. During the pioneer era, Zion became a \"landscape of villages\" in Utah. In modern times, Zion is still an ideal, though Mormons gather together in their individual congregations rather than a central geographic location.\n\n\n=== Beginnings ===\n\nThe Mormon movement began with the publishing of the Book of Mormon in March 1830, which Smith claimed was a translation of golden plates containing the religious history of an ancient American civilization which had been compiled by the ancient prophet-historian Mormon. Smith claimed that an angel had directed him to the golden plates, buried in the Hill Cumorah. On April 6, 1830, Smith founded the Church of Christ. In 1832, Smith added an account of a vision he had sometime in the early 1820s while living in Upstate New York . This vision would come to be regarded by some Mormons as the most important event in human history after the birth, ministry, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.The early church grew westward as Smith sent missionaries to proselytize. In 1831, the church moved to Kirtland, Ohio where missionaries had made a large number of converts and Smith began establishing an outpost in Jackson County, Missouri, where he planned to eventually build the city of Zion (or the New Jerusalem). In 1833, Missouri settlers, alarmed by the rapid influx of Mormons, expelled them from Jackson County into the nearby Clay County, where local residents were more welcoming.\nAfter Smith led a mission, known as Zion's Camp, to recover the land, he began building Kirtland Temple in Lake County, Ohio, where the church flourished. When the Missouri Mormons were later asked to leave Clay County in 1836, they secured land in what would become Caldwell County.The Kirtland era ended in 1838, after the failure of a church-sponsored anti-bank caused widespread defections, and Smith regrouped with the remaining church in Far West, Missouri. During the fall of 1838, tensions escalated into the Mormon War with the old Missouri settlers. On October 27, the governor of Missouri ordered that the Mormons \"must be treated as enemies\" and be exterminated or driven from the state. Between November and April, some eight thousand displaced Mormons migrated east into Illinois.\n\nIn 1839, the Mormons purchased the small town of Commerce, converted swampland on the banks of the Mississippi River, and renamed the area Nauvoo, Illinois, and began construction of the Nauvoo Temple. The city became the church's new headquarters and gathering place, and it grew rapidly, fueled in part by converts immigrating from Europe. Meanwhile, Smith introduced temple ceremonies meant to seal families together for eternity, as well as the doctrines of eternal progression or exaltation, and plural marriage.\nSmith created a service organization for women called the Relief Society, as well as an organization called the Council of Fifty, representing a future theodemocratic \"Kingdom of God\" on the earth. Smith also published the story of his First Vision, in which the Father and the Son appeared to him while he was about 14 years old. This vision would come to be regarded by some Mormons as the most important event in human history after the birth, ministry, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.In 1844, local prejudices and political tensions, fueled by Mormon peculiarity, internal dissent, and reports of polygamy, escalated into conflicts between Mormons and \"anti-Mormons\" in Illinois and Missouri. Smith was arrested, and on June 27, 1844, he and his brother Hyrum were killed by a mob in Carthage, Illinois. Because Hyrum was Smith's logical successor, their deaths caused a succession crisis, and Brigham Young assumed leadership over the majority of Latter Day Saints. Young had been a close associate of Smith's and was senior apostle of the Quorum of the Twelve. Smaller groups of Latter Day Saints followed other leaders to form other denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement.\n\n\n=== Pioneer era ===\n\nFor two years after Smith's death, conflicts escalated between Mormons and other Illinois residents. To prevent war, Brigham Young led the Mormon pioneers (constituting most of the Latter Day Saints) to a temporary winter quarters in Nebraska and then, eventually (beginning in 1847), to what became the Utah Territory. Having failed to build Zion within the confines of American society, the Mormons began to construct a society in isolation, based on their beliefs and values. The cooperative ethic that Mormons had developed over the last decade and a half became important as settlers branched out and colonized a large desert region now known as the Mormon Corridor. Colonizing efforts were seen as religious duties, and the new villages were governed by the Mormon bishops (local lay religious leaders). The Mormons viewed land as commonwealth, devising and maintaining a co-operative system of irrigation that allowed them to build a farming community in the desert.From 1849 to 1852, the Mormons greatly expanded their missionary efforts, establishing several missions in Europe, Latin America, and the South Pacific. Converts were expected to \"gather\" to Zion, and during Young's presidency (1847\u201377) over seventy thousand Mormon converts immigrated to America. Many of the converts came from England and Scandinavia, and were quickly assimilated into the Mormon community. Many of these immigrants crossed the Great Plains in wagons drawn by oxen, while some later groups pulled their possessions in small handcarts. During the 1860s, newcomers began using the new railroad that was under construction.In 1852, church leaders publicized the previously secret practice of plural marriage, a form of polygamy. Over the next 50 years, many Mormons (between 20 and 30 percent of Mormon families) entered into plural marriages as a religious duty, with the number of plural marriages reaching a peak around 1860, and then declining through the rest of the century. Besides the doctrinal reasons for plural marriage, the practice made some economic sense, as many of the plural wives were single women who arrived in Utah without brothers or fathers to offer them societal support.\n\nBy 1857, tensions had again escalated between Mormons and other Americans, largely as a result of accusations involving polygamy and the theocratic rule of the Utah Territory by Brigham Young. In 1857, U.S. President James Buchanan sent an army to Utah, which Mormons interpreted as open aggression against them. Fearing a repeat of Missouri and Illinois, the Mormons prepared to defend themselves, determined to torch their own homes in the case that they were invaded. The relatively peaceful Utah War ensued from 1857 to 1858, in which the most notable instance of violence was the Mountain Meadows massacre, when leaders of a local Mormon militia ordered the killing of a civilian emigrant party that was traveling through Utah during the escalating tensions. In 1858, Young agreed to step down from his position as governor and was replaced by a non-Mormon, Alfred Cumming. Nevertheless, the LDS Church still wielded significant political power in the Utah Territory.At Young's death in 1877, he was followed by other LDS Church presidents, who resisted efforts by the United States Congress to outlaw Mormon polygamous marriages. In 1878, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Reynolds v. United States that religious duty was not a suitable defense for practicing polygamy, and many Mormon polygamists went into hiding; later, Congress began seizing church assets. In September 1890, church president Wilford Woodruff issued a Manifesto that officially suspended the practice of polygamy. Although this Manifesto did not dissolve existing plural marriages, relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, such that Utah was admitted as a U.S. state in 1896. After the Manifesto, some Mormons continued to enter into polygamous marriages, but these eventually stopped in 1904 when church president Joseph F. Smith disavowed polygamy before Congress and issued a \"Second Manifesto\" calling for all plural marriages in the church to cease. Eventually, the church adopted a policy of excommunicating members found practicing polygamy, and today seeks actively to distance itself from \"fundamentalist\" groups that continue the practice.\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\n\nDuring the early 20th century, Mormons began to reintegrate into the American mainstream. In 1929, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir began broadcasting a weekly performance on national radio, becoming an asset for public relations. Mormons emphasized patriotism and industry, rising in socioeconomic status from the bottom among American religious denominations to middle-class.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Mormons began migrating out of Utah, a trend hurried by the Great Depression, as Mormons looked for work wherever they could find it. As Mormons spread out, church leaders created programs that would help preserve the tight-knit community feel of Mormon culture. In addition to weekly worship services, Mormons began participating in numerous programs such as Boy Scouting, a Young Women organization, church-sponsored dances, ward basketball, camping trips, plays, and religious education programs for youth and college students. During the Great Depression, the church started a welfare program to meet the needs of poor members, which has since grown to include a humanitarian branch that provides relief to disaster victims.\n\nDuring the later half of the 20th century, there was a retrenchment movement in Mormonism in which Mormons became more conservative, attempting to regain their status as a \"peculiar people\".\nThough the 1960s and 1970s brought changes such as Women's Liberation and the civil rights movement, Mormon leaders were alarmed by the erosion of traditional values, the sexual revolution, the widespread use of recreational drugs, moral relativism, and other forces they saw as damaging to the family.\nPartly to counter this, Mormons put an even greater emphasis on family life, religious education, and missionary work, becoming more conservative in the process. As a result, Mormons today are probably less integrated with mainstream society than they were in the early 1960s.Although black people have been members of Mormon congregations since Joseph Smith's time, before 1978, black membership was small. From 1852 to 1978, the LDS Church enforced a policy that restricted men of black African descent from being ordained to the church's lay priesthood. The church was sharply criticized for its policy during the civil rights movement, but the policy remained in force until a 1978 reversal that was prompted in part by questions about mixed-race converts in Brazil. In general, Mormons greeted the change with joy and relief. Since 1978, black membership has grown, and in 1997 there were approximately 500,000 black members of the church (about 5 percent of the total membership), mostly in Africa, Brazil and the Caribbean. Black membership has continued to grow substantially, especially in West Africa, where two temples have been built. Some black Mormons are members of the Genesis Group, an organization of black members that predates the priesthood ban, and is endorsed by the church.\n\nThe LDS Church grew rapidly after World War II and became a worldwide organization as missionaries were sent across the globe. The church doubled in size every 15 to 20 years, and by 1996, there were more Mormons outside the United States than inside. In 2012, there were an estimated 14.8 million Mormons, with roughly 57 percent living outside the United States. It is estimated that approximately 4.5 million Mormons \u2013 roughly 30% of the total membership \u2013 regularly attend services. A majority of U.S. Mormons are white and non-Hispanic (84 percent). Most Mormons are distributed in North and South America, the South Pacific, and Western Europe. The global distribution of Mormons resembles a contact diffusion model, radiating out from the organization's headquarters in Utah. The church enforces general doctrinal uniformity, and congregations on all continents teach the same doctrines, and international Mormons tend to absorb a good deal of Mormon culture, possibly because of the church's top-down hierarchy and a missionary presence. However, international Mormons often bring pieces of their own heritage into the church, adapting church practices to local cultures.As of December 2019, the LDS Church reported having 16,565,036 members worldwide. Chile, Uruguay, and several areas in the South Pacific have a higher percentage of Mormons than the United States (which is at about 2 percent). South Pacific countries and dependencies that are more than 10 percent Mormon include American Samoa, the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Niue, Samoa, and Tonga.\n\n\n== Culture and practices ==\n\nIsolation in Utah had allowed Mormons to create a culture of their own. As the faith spread around the world, many of its more distinctive practices followed. Mormon converts are urged to undergo lifestyle changes, repent of sins, and adopt sometimes atypical standards of conduct. Practices common to Mormons include studying scriptures, praying daily, fasting regularly, attending Sunday worship services, participating in church programs and activities on weekdays, and refraining from work on Sundays when possible. The most important part of the church services is considered to be the Lord's Supper (commonly called sacrament), in which church members renew covenants made at baptism. Mormons also emphasize standards they believe were taught by Jesus Christ, including personal honesty, integrity, obedience to law, chastity outside marriage and fidelity within marriage.In 2010, around 13\u201314 percent of Mormons lived in Utah, the center of cultural influence for Mormonism. Utah Mormons (as well as Mormons living in the Intermountain West) are on average more culturally and/or politically conservative than those living in some cosmopolitan centers elsewhere in the U.S. Utahns self-identifying as Mormon also attend church somewhat more on average than Mormons living in other states. (Nonetheless, whether they live in Utah or elsewhere in the U.S., Mormons tend to be more culturally and/or politically conservative than members of other U.S. religious groups.) Utah Mormons often place a greater emphasis on pioneer heritage than international Mormons who generally are not descendants of the Mormon pioneers.\n\nMormons have a strong sense of communality that stems from their doctrine and history. LDS Church members have a responsibility to dedicate their time and talents to helping the poor and building the church. The church is divided by locality into congregations called \"wards\", with several wards or branches to create a \"stake\". The vast majority of church leadership positions are lay positions, and church leaders may work 10 to 15 hours a week in unpaid church service. Observant Mormons also contribute 10 percent of their income to the church as tithing, and are often involved in humanitarian efforts. Many LDS young men, women and elderly couples choose to serve a proselytizing mission, during which they dedicate all of their time to the church, without pay.Mormons adhere to the Word of Wisdom, a health law or code that is interpreted as prohibiting the consumption of tobacco, alcohol, coffee and tea, while encouraging the use of herbs, grains, fruits, and a moderate consumption of meat. The Word of Wisdom is also understood to forbid other harmful and addictive substances and practices, such as the use of illegal drugs and abuse of prescription drugs. Mormons are encouraged to keep a year's supplies that include a food supply and a financial reserve. Mormons also oppose behaviors such as viewing pornography and gambling.The concept of a united family that lives and progresses forever is at the core of Latter-day Saint doctrine, and Mormons place a high importance on family life. Many Mormons hold weekly Family Home Evenings, in which an evening is set aside for family bonding, study, prayer and other activities they consider to be wholesome. Latter-day Saint fathers who hold the priesthood typically name and bless their children shortly after birth to formally give the child a name. Mormon parents hope and pray that their children will gain testimonies of the \"gospel\" so they can grow up and marry in temples.Mormons have a strict law of chastity, requiring abstention from sexual relations outside opposite-sex marriage and strict fidelity within marriage. All sexual activity (heterosexual and homosexual) outside marriage is considered a serious sin, with marriage recognized as only between a man and a woman. Same-sex marriages are not performed or supported by the LDS Church. Church members are encouraged to marry and have children, and Latter-day Saint families tend to be larger than average. Mormons are opposed to abortion, except in some exceptional circumstances, such as when pregnancy is the result of incest or rape, or when the life or health of the mother is in serious jeopardy. Many practicing adult Mormons wear religious undergarments that remind them of covenants and encourage them to dress modestly. Latter-day Saints are counseled not to partake of any form of media that is obscene or pornographic in any way, including media that depicts graphic representations of sex or violence. Tattoos and body piercings are also discouraged, with the exception of a single pair of earrings for LDS women.LGBT Mormons remain in good standing in the church if they abstain from homosexual relations and obey the law of chastity. While there are no official numbers, LDS Family Services estimates that there are on average four or five members per LDS ward who experience same-sex attraction. Gary Watts, former president of Family Fellowship, estimates that only 10 percent of homosexuals stay in the church. Many of these individuals have come forward through different support groups or websites discussing their homosexual attractions and concurrent church membership.\n\n\n== Groups within Mormonism ==\n\nNote that the categories below are not necessarily mutually exclusive.\n\n\n=== Latter-day Saints (\"LDS\") ===\n\nMembers of the LDS Church, also known as Latter-day Saints, constitute over 95 percent of Mormons. The beliefs and practices of LDS Mormons are generally guided by the teachings of LDS Church leaders. However, several smaller groups substantially differ from \"mainstream\" Mormonism in various ways.\nLDS Church members who do not actively participate in worship services or church callings are often called \"less-active\" or \"inactive\" (akin to the qualifying expressions non-observant or non-practicing used in relation to members of other religious groups). The LDS Church does not release statistics on church activity, but it is likely that about 40 percent of Mormons in the United States and 30 percent worldwide regularly attend worship services. Reasons for inactivity can include rejection of the fundamental beliefs and/or history of the church, lifestyle incongruities with doctrinal teachings, and problems with social integration. Activity rates tend to vary with age, and disengagement occurs most frequently between age 16 and 25. In 1998, the church reported a majority of less active members returned to church activity later in life. As of 2017, the LDS Church was losing millennial-age members, a phenomenon not unique to the LDS Church. Former Latter-day Saints who seek to disassociate themselves from the religion are often referred to as ex-Mormons.\n\n\n=== Fundamentalist Mormons ===\nMembers of sects that broke with the LDS Church over the issue of polygamy have become known as fundamentalist Mormons; these groups differ from mainstream Mormonism primarily in their belief in and practice of plural marriage. There are thought to be between 20,000 and 60,000 members of fundamentalist sects, (0.1\u20130.4 percent of Mormons), with roughly half of them practicing polygamy. There are a number of fundamentalist sects, the largest two being the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church) and the Apostolic United Brethren (AUB). In addition to plural marriage, some of these groups also practice a form of Christian communalism known as the law of consecration or the United Order. The LDS Church seeks to distance itself from all such polygamous groups, excommunicating their members if discovered practicing or teaching it, and today a majority of Mormon fundamentalists have never been members of the LDS Church.\n\n\n=== Liberal Mormons ===\n\nLiberal Mormons, also known as Progressive Mormons, take an interpretive approach to LDS teachings and scripture. They look to the scriptures for spiritual guidance, but may not necessarily believe the teachings to be literally or uniquely true. For liberal Mormons, revelation is a process through which God gradually brings fallible human beings to greater understanding. A person in this group is sometimes mistakenly regarded by others within the mainstream church as a Jack Mormon, although this term is more commonly used to describe a different group with distinct motives to live the gospel in a non-traditional manner. Liberal Mormons place doing good and loving fellow human beings above the importance of believing correctly. In a separate context, members of small progressive breakaway groups have also adopted the label.\n\n\n=== Cultural Mormons ===\nCultural Mormons are individuals who may not believe in certain doctrines or practices of the institutional LDS Church yet identify as members of the Mormon ethnic identity. Usually this is a result of having been raised in the LDS faith, or as having converted and spent a large portion of one's life as an active member of the LDS Church. Cultural Mormons may or may not be actively involved with the LDS Church. In some cases they may not be members of the LDS Church.\n\n\n== Beliefs ==\n\nMormons have a scriptural canon consisting of the Bible (both Old and New Testaments), the Book of Mormon, and a collection of revelations and writings by Joseph Smith known as the Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price. Mormons, however, have a relatively open definition of scripture. As a general rule, anything spoken or written by a prophet, while under inspiration, is considered to be the word of God. Thus, the Bible, written by prophets and apostles, is the word of God, so far as it is translated correctly. The Book of Mormon is also believed to have been written by ancient prophets, and is viewed as a companion to the Bible. By this definition, the teachings of Smith's successors are also accepted as scripture, though they are always measured against, and draw heavily from the scriptural canon.\n\nMormons believe in \"a friendly universe\", governed by a God whose aim it is to bring his children to immortality and eternal life. Mormons have a unique perspective on the nature of God, the origin of man, and the purpose of life. For instance, Mormons believe in a pre-mortal existence where people were literal spirit children of God, and that God presented a plan of salvation that would allow his children to progress and become more like him. The plan involved the spirits receiving bodies on earth and going through trials in order to learn, progress, and receive a \"fulness of joy\". The most important part of the plan involved Jesus, the eldest of God's children, coming to earth as the literal Son of God, to conquer sin and death so that God's other children could return. According to Mormons, every person who lives on earth will be resurrected, and nearly all of them will be received into various kingdoms of glory. To be accepted into the highest kingdom, a person must fully accept Christ through faith, repentance, and through ordinances such as baptism and the laying on of hands.\n\nAccording to Mormons, a deviation from the original principles of Christianity, known as the Great Apostasy, began not long after the ascension of Jesus Christ. It was marked with the corruption of Christian doctrine by Greek and other philosophies, with followers dividing into different ideological groups. Mormons claim the martyrdom of the apostles led to a loss of priesthood authority to administer the church and its ordinances.\nMormons believe that God restored the early Christian church through Joseph Smith. In particular, Mormons believe that angels such as Peter, James, John, John the Baptist, Moses, and Elijah appeared to Smith and others and bestowed various priesthood authorities on them. Mormons believe that their church is the \"only true and living church\" because of the divine authority restored through Smith. Mormons self-identify as being Christian, while many Christians, particularly evangelical Protestants, disagree with this view. Mormons view other religions as having portions of the truth, doing good works, and having genuine value.The LDS Church has a top-down hierarchical structure with a president\u2013prophet dictating revelations for the entire church. Lay Mormons are also believed to have access to inspiration, and are encouraged to seek their own personal revelations. Mormons see Joseph Smith's First Vision as proof that the heavens are open, and that God answers prayers. They place considerable emphasis on \"asking God\" to find out if something is true. Most Mormons do not claim to have had heavenly visions like Smith's in response to prayers, but feel that God talks to them in their hearts and minds through the Holy Ghost. Though Mormons have some beliefs that are considered strange in a modernized world, they continue to hold onto their beliefs because they feel God has spoken to them.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of Latter Day Saints\nList of denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement: Followers of Brigham Young\nList of former or dissident LDS\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nchurchofjesuschrist.org and comeuntochrist.org, official websites of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\nMormons page at the Public Broadcasting Service", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Christus_statue_temple_square_salt_lake_city.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Crossing_the_Mississippi_on_the_Ice_by_C.C.A._Christensen.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Flag_of_Argentina.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Flag_of_Chile.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Flag_of_Mexico.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Flag_of_Peru.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Flag_of_the_Philippines.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Global_thinking.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Igreja_SUD_uruguaiana_rs.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Joseph_Preaching_to_the_Indians_by_C.C.A._Christensen.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Joseph_Smith_first_vision_stained_glass.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/LDS_Global_Distribution_%282009%29.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Latter_Day_Saint_confirmation_%28Mayhew_1852%29.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Mormon_Pioneer_handcart_statue.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Mtchoirandorchestra_ConferenceCenter.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/P_christianity.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Salt_Lake_Temple%2C_Utah_-_Sept_2004-2.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/05/Flag_of_Brazil.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e2/Symbol_portal_class.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg"], "summary": "Mormons are a religious and cultural group related to Mormonism, the principal branch of the Latter Day Saint movement started by Joseph Smith in upstate New York during the 1820s. After Smith's death in 1844 the movement split into several groups following different leaders; the majority followed Brigham Young, while smaller groups followed Joseph Smith III, Sidney Rigdon, and James Strang. Most of these smaller groups eventually coalesced into the Community of Christ, and the term Mormon typically refers to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), as today this branch is far larger than all the others combined. (Since 2018, the LDS Church has requested that its members be referred to as \"Latter-day Saints\".) People who identify as Mormons may also be independently religious, secular and non-practicing, or belong to other denominations.\nMormons have developed a strong sense of community that stems from their doctrine and history. One of the central doctrinal issues that defined Mormonism in the 19th century was the practice of plural marriage, a form of religious polygamy. From 1852 until 1904, when the LDS Church banned the practice, many Mormons who had followed Brigham Young to the Utah Territory openly practiced polygamy.  Mormons dedicate significant time and resources to serving in their churches. A prominent practice among young and retired members of the LDS Church is to serve a full-time proselytizing mission. Mormons have a health code which eschews alcoholic beverages, tobacco, tea, coffee, and addictive substances. They tend to be very family-oriented and have strong connections across generations and with extended family, reflective of their belief that families can be sealed together beyond death. They also have a strict law of chastity, requiring abstention from sexual relations outside heterosexual marriage and fidelity within marriage, though the Community of Christ is accepting of LGBTQ individuals and relationships. \nMormons self-identify as Christian, but some non-Mormons consider Mormons to be non-Christian because some of their beliefs differ from those of Nicene Christianity. Mormons believe that Christ's church was restored through Joseph Smith and is guided by living prophets and apostles. Mormons believe in the Bible, as well as other books of scripture, such as the Book of Mormon. They have a unique view of cosmology and believe that all people are literal spirit-children of God. Mormons believe that returning to God requires following the example of Jesus Christ, and accepting his atonement through repentance and ordinances such as baptism.\nDuring the 19th century, Mormon converts tended to gather to a central geographic location, a trend that reversed somewhat in the 1920s and 30s. The center of Mormon cultural influence is in Utah, and North America has more Mormons than any other continent, although the majority of Mormons live outside the United States. As of December 2020, the LDS Church reported having 16,663,663 members worldwide."}, "Nauvoo_Temple": {"links": ["Nauvoo, Illinois", "Beehive House", "Temple Square", "Harper's Magazine", "Ordinance ", "Wesley P.

The church's first temple was completed in Kirtland, Ohio, United States, in 1836. When the main body of the church was forced out of Nauvoo, Illinois, in the winter of 1846, the church attempted to sell the building, finally succeeding in 1848. The building was damaged by fire and a tornado before being demolished.\nIn 1937, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) reacquired the lot on which the original temple had stood. In 2000, the church began to build a temple on the original site with an exterior that is a replica of the first temple, but whose interior is laid out like a modern Latter-day Saint temple. On June 27, 2002, a date that coincided with the 158th anniversary of the death of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, the temple was dedicated by the LDS Church as the Nauvoo Illinois Temple.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Latter Day Saints made preparations to build a temple soon after establishing their headquarters at Nauvoo, Illinois, in 1839. On April 6, 1841, the temple's cornerstone was laid under the direction of Joseph Smith, the church founder and president; Sidney Rigdon gave the principal oration. At its base the building was 128 feet (39 m) long and 88 feet (27 m) wide with a clock tower and weather vane reaching to  a total height of 165 feet (50 m)\u2014a 60% increase over the dimensions of the Kirtland Temple. Like Kirtland, the Nauvoo Temple contained two assembly halls, one on the first floor and one on the second, called the lower and upper courts. Both had classrooms and offices in the attic. Unlike Kirtland, the Nauvoo Temple had a full basement which housed a baptismal font. Because the Saints had to abandon Nauvoo, the building was not entirely completed. The basement with its font was finished, as were the first floor assembly hall and the attic. When these parts of the building were completed they were used for performing ordinances (basement and attic) or for worship services (first floor assembly hall).\n\nThe Nauvoo Temple was designed in the Greek Revival style by architect William Weeks, under the direction of Joseph Smith. Weeks's design made use of distinctively Latter Day Saint motifs, including sunstones, moonstones, and starstones. It is often mistakenly thought that these stones represent the three degrees of glory in the Latter Day Saint conception of the afterlife, but the stones appear in the wrong order. Instead, Wandle Mace, foreman for the framework of the Nauvoo Temple, has explained that the design of the temple was meant to be \"a representation of the Church, the Bride, the Lamb's wife\". In this regard, Mace references John's statement in Revelation 12:1 concerning the \"woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.\" This explains why the starstones are at the top of the temple (\"crown of twelve stars\"), the sunstones in the middle (\"clothed with the sun\") and the moonstones at the bottom (\"moon under her feet\").\nConstruction was only half complete at the death of Joseph Smith in 1844. After a succession crisis, Brigham Young was sustained as the church's leader by the majority of Latter Day Saints in Nauvoo. As mob violence increased during the summer of 1845, he encouraged the Latter Day Saints to complete the temple even as they prepared to abandon the city, so portions of it could be used for Latter Day Saint ordinance, such as baptisms for the dead in the basement font. During the winter of 1845\u201346, the temple began to be used for additional ordinances, including the Nauvoo-era endowment, sealings in marriage, and adoptions. The Nauvoo Temple was in use for less than three months.\nMost of the Latter Day Saints left Nauvoo, beginning in February 1846, but a small crew remained to finish the temple's first floor, so that it could be formally dedicated. Once the first floor was finished with pulpits and benches, the building was finally dedicated in private services on April 30, 1846, and in public services on 1 May. In September 1846 the remaining Latter Day Saints were driven from the city and vigilantes from the neighboring region, including Carthage, Illinois, entered the near-empty city and vandalized the temple.\nInitially the church's agents tried to lease the structure, first to the Catholic Church, and then to private individuals. When this failed, they attempted to sell the temple, asking up to $200,000, but this effort also met with no success. On March 11, 1848, the LDS Church's agents sold the building to David T. LeBaron, for $5,000. Finally, the New York Home Missionary Society expressed interest in leasing the building as a school, but around midnight on October 8\u20139, 1848, the temple was set on fire by an unknown arsonist. Nauvoo's residents attempted to put out the fire, but the temple was gutted. James J. Strang, leader of the Strangite faction of Latter Day Saints, accused Young's agents of setting fire to the temple. However, Strang's charges were never proven. On April 2, 1849, LeBaron sold the damaged temple to \u00c9tienne Cabet for $2,000. Cabet, whose followers were called Icarians, hoped to establish Nauvoo as a communistic utopia.\n\n\n=== Destruction ===\n\nAfter the fire of October 9, 1848, only the four exterior walls remained standing. The Icarian leader Cabet was fascinated by the temple and planned to reconstruct it, and a considerable amount of money was spent in the endeavor.  However, on May 27, 1850, Nauvoo was struck by a major tornado which toppled one of the walls of the temple. One source claimed the storm seemed to \"single out the Temple\", felling \"the walls with a roar that was heard miles away\". Cabet ordered the demolition of two more walls in the interests of public safety, leaving only the fa\u00e7ade standing. The Icarians used much of the temple's stone to build a new school building on the southwest corner of the temple lot. By 1857, however, most of Cabet's followers had left Nauvoo and over time many of the original stones for the temple were used in the construction of other buildings throughout Hancock County. In February 1865, Nauvoo's City Council ordered the final demolition of the last standing portion of the temple\u2014one lone corner of the fa\u00e7ade. Soon afterwards, all evidence of the temple disappeared, except for a hand pump over a well that supplied water to the baptismal font. Three of the original sunstones are known to have survived and are on display\u2014one is on loan to LDS Church's Visitor Center in Nauvoo, one is in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C, and the third and only one that has not been restored is displayed, along with the only moonstone on display, at the Joseph Smith Historic Center of the Community of Christ.\n\n\n== Nauvoo Illinois Temple ==\n\nFrom 1937 to 1962, the LDS Church reacquired and restored the lot on which the temple stood. In 1999, church president Gordon B. Hinckley announced the rebuilding of the temple on its original footprint. After two years of construction, on June 27, 2002, the church dedicated the Nauvoo Illinois Temple, whose exterior is a replica of the first temple, but whose interior is laid out like a modern LDS temple.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nAt its base the Nauvoo Temple was 128 feet (39 m) long and 88 feet (27 m) wide with a tower and weather vane reaching to 164 feet (50 m).  The second temple of the Latter Day Saint movement  was built 60 percent larger in dimensions than its predecessor, the Kirtland Temple. Like Kirtland, the temple contained two assembly halls, one on the first floor and one on the second, called the lower and upper courts. Both had classrooms and offices in the attic. Unlike Kirtland, it had a full basement which housed a baptismal font.\n\n\n=== Exterior ===\nThe limestone used for the original temple was quarried from a site just west of the temple. Much of that quarry, however, was submerged by rising water behind the Keokuk Dam in 1912. Therefore, Russellville, Alabama, subsidiary of Minnesota's Vetter Stone Company, was chosen by the Church to provide stone for the new temple. Church officials say the quarry was selected because it provided stone that is a close match to the limestone originally used.\n\n\n=== Basement ===\n\nThe basement of the Nauvoo Temple was used as the baptistry, containing a large baptismal font in the center of the main room.\nThe basement was accessed by spiral staircases at the northwest and southwest corners of the temple. The staircase landing was made of wood and opened to a short hallway heading east, leading to the basement proper. Between the two hallways was an unfinished room sealed off from the rest of the temple, containing an old well that had been dug but never used.  The room was discovered by an anti-Mormon mob who broke through the floor of the vestibule above.The basement proper was one hundred feet long and forty feet wide with six rooms of varying sizes on either side. The sides of the rooms were stone and abutted the massive stone piers that supported the floors above. With the exception of the two rooms at the western end of the basement, reportedly used for clerical purposes, each side room rose two steps in height from the basement floor. The rooms were dressing rooms for those using the font. The floor was made of red brick laid in a herringbone pattern. The walls were painted white. The floor sloped down to the center of the room to allow water to run toward a drain beneath the font.During an archaeological investigation of the temple site, two highly polished limestone blocks were discovered. Approximately twelve feet east of the entrance to the baptistry and ten feet from either the side of the support piers rested the blocks, roughly fourteen inches square, which projected seven inches (178 mm) above the brick floor. These objects are not mentioned in any account of the basement, and their purpose is unknown. They may have held some type of support columns, dividing the font from the entrance to the basement, or they may simply have been a decorative element beneath a vase or something similar.  They may have been part of a feature planned, but not used, in the final construction.\n\n\n==== The baptismal font ====\n\nEvery visitor who wrote about the temple mentioned the baptismal font. It was clearly the most impressive feature of the temple.  There were actually two fonts built during the lifetime of the temple, a temporary wooden one, and a permanent limestone one.The first font was built out of tongue and grooved white pine and painted white. It was sixteen feet long, twelve feet wide and four feet deep. The lip of the font was seven feet from the floor. The font's cap and base were carved molding in an \"antique style\" and the sides were finished with panel work.  Two railed stairways led to the font from the north and south sides.The font was held up by twelve oxen as are almost all temple fonts. They were carved from pine planking that was glued together. They were patterned from the most beautiful five-year-old steer that could be found in the region. The head, shoulders and legs protruded beyond the base of the font, and they appeared to have sunk to their knees into the pavement. The most perfect horn that could be found was used to model the animals' horns.A decision was made to replace the wooden font in 1845, apparently because the water caused a mildew odor, and possibly because the wood had begun to rot. The new limestone font followed the pattern of the wooden one. Twelve oxen held up the basin, four on each side and two at each end. The oxen were solid stone and similarly were placed and appeared sunken into the floor. Where the oxen met the basin, the stone was carved to suggest drapery.  The ears of the oxen were made of tin. The stairs were moved to an east/west orientation making access to the font easier.A well on the east side of the font provided the water supply.  There may have been some kind of tank at the eastern end of the baptistry to store and heat water.\n\n\n=== The vestibule ===\n\nA flight of eight broad steps led to a landing where two more steps entered three archways.  These archways led to the vestibule, the formal entrance to the temple.\nThe archways were approximately nine feet wide and twenty-one feet high.\nThe vestibule itself was forty-three feet by seventeen feet in dimension.  It was composed of limestone on all four of its walls. The floor has been speculated to be made of wood, because when the mob occupied the temple briefly in late 1847, they broke through the floor to reach a sealed off room in the basement.  Had the floor been limestone, it seems unlikely that they would have dug it up.\nTwo large double doors on the east wall opened to the first floor assembly hall of the lower court, known as the \"Great Hall\". Two doors, one on the North wall, and another on the South opened to the landing of two spiral staircases, one in the Northwest corner, and the other in the Southwest corner which led all the way to the attic.  These were the only access points to the rest of the building.\nOne report stated that on the east wall of the vestibule was an entablature, similar to the one in the facade, which read in bright gilded letters, \"THE HOUSE OF THE LORD - Built by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints - Commenced April 6th, 1841 - HOLINESS TO THE LORD.\"\n\n\n=== The stairwells ===\nThe two stairwells were constructed of dressed limestone walls. One rose from Northwest corner and the other at the Southwest corner of the temple.  They were not true circles but were flatted on four sides. Nor were they symmetrical, being sixteen feet in diameter from East to West and seventeen feet in diameter from North to South. This was done to support landings and other support structures.The staircases, made of wood, provided access to all of the temple from the basement to the attic with a landing at each floor. They had lamps for illumination at night, and had windows for daytime illumination. William Weeks' elevation of the front facade does not show windows at the basement level of the two stairwells, and photographic evidence is inconclusive. However, Joseph Smith's youngest son, David Smith, rendered a painting of the temple's damaged facade, clearly shows half-circular windows at the basement level in the north and south corners of the facade.The staircase in the northwest corner was never completed. It was roughed in with temporary boards resting on the risers. Workmen used this staircase to gain access to the building during its construction, especially during the winter of 1845-1846 when persons were using the other staircase to reach the attic for ordinance work. The southwest staircase was completely finished for use.  It included lamps for night illumination, and may have been carpeted near the attic landing.\n\n\n=== The Great Hall ===\nEntrance to the first floor assembly hall, called the \"Great Hall\", was through two large double doors at the east end of the vestibule. The Great Hall occupied the remainder of the floor space East of the vestibule. The room was flanked on either side by seven large, arched windows, with four similar windows along the east wall. An arched ceiling spanned some fifty feet in breadth, in the center. the floor was stained wood and the walls were painted white.There were two rooms to the north just past the entrance. It has been suggested that these rooms were used initially by William Weeks, because they are referred by Thomas Bullock as the \"architect's room.\" Their eventual intended use is not clear.\n\n\n==== Pulpits ====\nAt the east and west ends of the hall were two sets of similar pulpits. Resembling the pulpits used in the Kirtland Temple, and repeated in later temples, they were arranged with four levels, the top three consisting of a group of three semi-circular stands.  The lowest level was a drop-table which was raised for use in the sacrament.The pulpits to the east, standing between the windows, were reserved for the Melchizedek Priesthood.  Accordingly, each pulpit had initials identifying the priesthood office of the occupant. The top most pulpits read P.H.P., which stood for President of the High Priesthood. The next level down had P.S.Q for President of the Seventy Quorums. Below that, the labels were P.H.Q. which stood for President of the High priests Quorum, and the folding table had the inscription P.E.Q. standing for President of the Elders Quorum.Above the Eastern pulpits, written in gilded letters, along the arch of the ceiling, were the words,\"The Lord Has Seen Our Sacrifice - Come After Us.\"The pulpits to the West end were reserved for the Aaronic Priesthood. Each pulpit similarly had initials identifying the priesthood officers who occupied that stand. The highest three pulpits bore the initials P.A.P., which stood for President of the Aaronic Priesthood. The next lower pulpits had P.P.Q., for President of the Priests Quorum.  Again, the next had P.T.Q., for President of the Teachers Quorum and on the table at the bottom was written P.D.Q., for President of the Deacons Quorum.\n\n\n==== Pews ====\nSimilar to the Kirtland Temple, the hall was fitted with enclosed pews with two aisles running down its length. There were also pews for a band and choir.  The room could accommodate up to 3,500 people. Because there were pulpits on both ends of the room, the pews had movable backs which could be swung to face either direction, depending on who was presiding - the Melchizedek Priesthood or the Aaronic Priesthood.\n\n\n=== First floor mezzanine ===\n\nAccess to the first floor mezzanine was directly from landings of the two staircases in the west end of the building. A foyer, corresponding in size to the vestibule below, connected the two stairway landings.\nEvidence suggests that this mezzanine had fourteen small rooms, seven along each side of the North and South wall. Each room had a small circular window supplying light. These rooms may never have been completed, except perhaps some kind of partition dividing them.\n\n\n=== Second floor assembly hall ===\n\nThe second floor hall was similar in construction to the Great Hall, except that it included the foyer area where the vestibule would be.  This made the room about seventeen feet longer. A 41-foot-long (12 m) stone arch ran north and south between the circular stairwells supporting the massive timbers for the tower above. It had seven large windows along the north and south wide, with four windows along the east wall.The floor would have a similar configuration as the Great Hall with a set of double pulpits and pews, but the room was never completed.  Doors were never hung, the plastering was unfinished, and the floorboards were only rough timber, not the tongue and grove finished hardwoods of the other floors. The room, when used for an occasional meeting, was furnished with wooden benches.\n\n\n=== Second floor mezzanine rooms ===\n\nThe second mezzanine was similar to the first floor mezzanine.  It was accessed via the two staircases at the West end of the building.  There was no foyer connecting the two stairwells.The second floor mezzanine is also presumed to have been divided into fourteen small rooms, seven rooms along each side of the North and South walls of the building, between the arched ceiling of the second floor. Circular windows in the entablature of the building allowed for illumination. Just as with the second floor assembly room, there is no evidence that these rooms were ever completed, except perhaps for the partitions dividing each room. There was a staircase in the second room from the Southeast corner leading to a room above, providing another access method to the attic.\n\n\n=== Attic ===\n\nAt the top of the two stairways, opening to a foyer, was the attic floor. The attic was not built of limestone but of wood. It was composed of two sections.  The West end of the temple was a flat roofed section that supported the tower. The rest of the attic was a pitched-roof section running the length of the temple.The flat-room section was further divided into two sections, the foyer on the west side, and a suite of rooms to the east. When the attic was used for ordinance work, they were used as a pantry, wardrobe and storage rooms. The area was illuminated by six windows along the foyer's west wall. Outside windows also provided light along the north and south sides. The roof had four octagonal skylight windows to provide light to the interior rooms, in addition to a twenty-foot arched window.The incline of the roof prevented a six-foot-tall man from standing erect along the outside wall. The second room from the south-east corner had a stairway leading to a room in the mezzanine below.\n\n\n=== Tower rooms ===\nRising from the plateau of the attic is an octagonal tower. The tower was divided into three sections, each accessible by a series of stairways leading from the attic to an observation deck at the top. The lowest section was the belfry. The bell was rung for various occasions. Between the observation deck and the belfry was a section containing the four clockwork mechanisms.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nComparison of temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\nJoseph Toronto\nList of temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\nList of temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by geographic region\nTemple architecture (LDS Church)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBrown, Lisle G.

The church's first temple was completed in Kirtland, Ohio, United States, in 1836. When the main body of the church was forced out of Nauvoo, Illinois, in the winter of 1846, the church attempted to sell the building, finally succeeding in 1848. The building was damaged by fire and a tornado before being demolished.\nIn 1937, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) reacquired the lot on which the original temple had stood. In 2000, the church began to build a temple on the original site with an exterior that is a replica of the first temple, but whose interior is laid out like a modern Latter-day Saint temple. On June 27, 2002, a date that coincided with the 158th anniversary of the death of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, the temple was dedicated by the LDS Church as the Nauvoo Illinois Temple."}, "Endowment_": {"links": ["Taxation of private equity and hedge funds", "Doctorate", "Capital call", "List of Canadian universities by endowment", "List of colleges and universities in the United States by endowment", "Impact investing", "Lucasian Professor of Mathematics", "Paul Revere", "Nonprofit organization", "Khaybar", "Venture capital financing", "Private equity in the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys", "George Washington University", "Tax shelter", "Henry VIII of England", "Philosophy", "High-net-worth individual", "Leona Helmsley", "Carried interest", "American Economic Review", "Post-money valuation", "Private equity", "Trust ", "Endowment hoarding", "Professor", "The Wall Street Journal", "Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act", "Louvre", "Venture capital trust", "Mezzanine capital", "Corporate venture capital", "Distribution waterfall", "Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization", "Muslim", "NDL ", "two thousand and eight economic downturn", "Athens", "Internal rate of return", "Commercial bank", "Business Development Company", "Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation", "Limited partnership", "Startup company", "Capitalization table", "LCCN ", "Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica", "Paola, Kansas", "Paris", "College and university rankings", "Financial instrument", "Private equity secondary market", "Aristotelianism", "Madrasa", "Umar", "Dividend recapitalization", "Publicly traded private equity", "Leveraged recapitalization", "Epicureanism", "NARA ", "Lady Margaret Beaufort", "Charitable organization", "Lady Margaret's Professor of Divinity", "Scholarship", "Private investment in public equity", "Payment in lieu of taxes", "The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation", "Undercapitalization", "Harvard University endowment", "Isaac Newton", "Lists of institutions of higher education by endowment size", "College", "Business incubator", "List of South African universities by endowment", "History of private equity and venture capital", "American Economic Association", "Emperor", "Frederick Goff", "Principal ", "American Institute of Certified Public Accountants", "Merchant bank", "University of Toronto", "Equity co-investment", "Private-equity fund", "Pledge fund", "Growth capital", "Mergers and acquisitions", "Private equity in the two thousands", "Pension fund", "University of Cambridge", "Charitable trust", "Disinvestment from South Africa", "Harvard College", "Limited liability company", "Waqf", "Stoicism", "Investment banking", "Trustee", "The Cleveland Foundation", "Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity ", "Family office", "Buy\u2013sell agreement", "The Tech ", "Endowment invasion", "Crowdfunding", "Divisional buyout", "Stephen Hawking", "Insurance", "Roman Empire", "Yale University", "Boston Herald", "List of UK universities by endowment", "Leveraged buyout", "Leverage ", "Wayback Machine", "List of wealthiest charitable foundations", "Platonism", "Muhammad", "Venture capital", "Disinvestment", "Pre-money valuation", "Buyout", "Universities", "Private equity in the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys", "Sovereign wealth fund", "Arabic language", "Stanford University", "University of Glasgow", "Angel investor", "Endowment tax", "High-yield debt", "Native Arts and Culture Foundation", "Early history of private equity", "Assets under management", "Capital structure", "Foundation ", "Jihad", "University", "Venture debt", "Regius Professorships", "Liquidation preference", "Management buyout", "Community foundation", "Vintage year", "Private school", "ISBN ", "Management fee", "Fossil fuel divestment", "University of Oxford", "Venture round", "Ford Foundation", "Public Market Equivalent", "Abbasid dynasty", "Envy ratio", "Fund of funds", "Sharia", "Space Needle", "Divestment", "International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement", "Capital commitment", "Real estate", "Private foundation", "Private-equity firm", "Institutional investor", "Donor intent", "San Francisco Chronicle", "Cy-pr\u00e8s doctrine", "Initial public offering", "Seed money", "Financial sponsor", "Brown University", "Istanbul", "The GW Hatchet", "Ford Foundation Building", "Marcus Aurelius", "Mortmain", "Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum", "Central Wakf Council", "Doi ", "Return on investment"], "content": "A financial endowment is a legal structure for managing, and in many cases indefinitely perpetuating, a pool of financial, real estate, or other investments for a specific purpose according to the will of its founders and donors. Endowments are often structured so that the principal value is kept intact, while the investment income or a small part of the principal is available for use each year.\n\nEndowments are often governed and managed either as a nonprofit corporation, a charitable foundation, or a private foundation that, while serving a good cause, might not qualify as a public charity. In some jurisdictions, it is common for endowed funds to be established as a trust independent of the organizations and the causes the endowment is meant to serve. Institutions that commonly manage endowments include academic institutions (e.g., colleges, universities, and private schools); cultural institutions (e.g., museums, libraries, and theaters); service organizations (e.g., hospitals, retirement homes; the Red Cross); and religious organizations (e.g., churches, synagogues, mosques).\nPrivate endowments are some of the wealthiest entities in the world, notably private higher education endowments. Harvard University's endowment (valued at US$40.9 billion as of 2019) is the largest academic endowment in the world. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is one of the wealthiest private foundations as of 2019 with endowment of $46.8 billion as of December 31, 2018.\n\n\n== Types ==\nMost private endowments in the United States are governed by the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act which is based in part on the concept of donor intent that helps define what restrictions are imposed on the principal and earnings of the fund. Endowments in the United States are commonly categorized in one of four ways:\nUnrestricted endowment can be used in any way the recipient chooses to carry out its mission.\nTerm endowment funds stipulate that all or part of the principal may be expended only after the expiration of a stated period of time or occurrence of a specified event, depending on donor wishes.\nQuasi endowment funds are designated endowments by an organization's governing body rather than by the donor. Therefore both the principal and the income may be accessed at the organization's discretion. Quasi endowment funds are still subject to any other donor restrictions or intent.\nRestricted endowments ensure that the original principal is held in perpetuity and that the earnings from this original principal are allocated according to the donor's requirements.\n\n\n== Restrictions and donor intent ==\nEndowment revenue can be restricted by donors to serve many purposes. Endowed professorships or scholarships restricted to a particular subject are common; in some places a donor could fund a trust exclusively for the support of a pet. Ignoring the restriction is called \"invading\" the endowment. But change of circumstance or financial duress like bankruptcy can preclude carrying out the donor's intent.  A court can alter the use of restricted endowment under a doctrine called cy-pr\u00e8s meaning to find an alternative \"as near as possible\" to the donor's intent.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest endowed chairs were established by the Roman emperor and Stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius in Athens in AD 176. Aurelius created one endowed chair for each of the major schools of philosophy: Platonism, Aristotelianism, Stoicism, and Epicureanism. Later, similar endowments were set up in some other major cities of the Empire.The earliest universities were founded in Asia and Africa. Their endowment by a prince or monarch and their role in training government officials made early Mediterranean universities similar to Islamic madrasas, although madrasas were generally smaller, and individual teachers, rather than the madrasa itself, granted the license or degree.Waqf (Arabic: \u0648\u064e\u0642\u0652\u0641\u200e; [\u02c8w\u0251qf]), also known as 'hubous' (\u062d\u064f\u0628\u0648\u0633) or mortmain property, is a similar concept from  Islamic law, which typically involves donating a building, plot of land or other assets for Muslim religious or charitable purposes with no intention of reclaiming the assets. The donated assets may be held by a charitable trust.\n\nIbn Umar reported, Umar Ibn Al-Khattab got land in Khaybar, so he came to the prophet Muhammad and asked him to advise him about it. The Prophet said, 'If you like, make the property inalienable and give the profit from it to charity.'\" It goes on to say that Umar gave it away as alms, that the land itself would not be sold, inherited or donated. He gave it away for the poor, the relatives, the slaves, the jihad, the travelers and the guests. And it will not be held against him who administers it if he consumes some of its yield in an appropriate manner or feeds a friend who does not enrich himself by means of it.\nWhen a man dies, only three deeds will survive him: continuing alms, profitable knowledge and a child praying for him.\nThe two oldest known waqfiya (deed) documents are from the 9th century, while a third one dates from the early 10th century, all three within the Abbasid Period. The oldest dated waqfiya goes back to 876 CE, concerns a multi-volume Qur'an edition and is held by the Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum in Istanbul. A possibly older waqfiya is a papyrus held by the Louvre Museum in Paris, with no written date but considered to be from the mid-9th century.\nThe earliest known waqf in Egypt, founded by financial official Ab\u016b Bakr Mu\u1e25ammad bin Ali al-Madhara'i in 919 (during the Abbasid period), is a pond called Birkat \u1e24abash together with its surrounding orchards, whose revenue was to be used to operate a hydraulic complex and feed the poor. In India, wakfs are relatively common among Muslim communities and are regulated by the Central Wakf Council and governed by Wakf Act 1995 (which superseded Wakf Act 1954).\n\n\n== Modern college and university endowments ==\n\nAcademic institutions, such as colleges and universities, will frequently control an endowment fund that finances a portion of the operating or capital requirements of the institution. In addition to a general endowment fund, each university may also control a number of restricted endowments that are intended to fund specific areas within the institution. The most common examples are endowed professorships (also known as named chairs), and endowed scholarships or fellowships.\nThe practice of endowing professorships began in the modern European university system in England in 1502, when Lady Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and grandmother to the future king Henry VIII, created the first endowed chairs in divinity at the universities of Oxford (Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity) and Cambridge (Lady Margaret's Professor of Divinity). Nearly 50 years later, Henry VIII established the Regius Professorships at both universities, this time in five subjects: divinity, civil law, Hebrew, Greek, and physic\u2014the last of those corresponding to what are now known as medicine and basic sciences. Today, the University of Glasgow has fifteen Regius Professorships.\nPrivate individuals also adopted the practice of endowing professorships. Isaac Newton held the Lucasian Chair of Mathematics at Cambridge beginning in 1669, more recently held by the celebrated physicist Stephen Hawking.In the United States, the endowment is often integral to the financial health of educational institutions. Alumni or friends of institutions sometimes contribute capital to the endowment. The use of endowment funding is strong in the United States and Canada but less commonly found outside of North America, with the exceptions of Cambridge and Oxford universities. Endowment funds have also been created to support secondary and elementary school districts in several states in the United States.\n\n\n=== Endowed professorships ===\nAn endowed professorship (or endowed chair) is a position permanently paid for with the revenue from an endowment fund specifically set up for that purpose. Typically, the position is designated to be in a certain department. The donor might be allowed to name the position. Endowed professorships aid the university by providing a faculty member who does not have to be paid entirely out of the operating budget, allowing the university to either reduce its student-to-faculty ratio, a statistic used for college rankings and other institutional evaluations, or direct money that would otherwise have been spent on salaries toward other university needs. In addition, holding such a professorship is considered to be an honour in the academic world, and the university can use them to reward its best faculty or to recruit top professors from other institutions.\n\n\n=== Endowed scholarships and fellowships ===\nAn endowed scholarship is tuition (and possibly other costs) assistance that is permanently paid for with the revenue of an endowment fund specifically set up for that purpose. It can be either merit-based or need-based (the latter is only awarded to those students for whom the college expense would cause their family financial hardship) depending on university policy or donor preferences. Some universities will facilitate donors' meeting the students they are helping. The amount that must be donated to start an endowed scholarship can vary greatly.\nFellowships are similar, although they are most commonly associated with graduate students. In addition to helping with tuition, they may also include a stipend. Fellowships with a stipend may encourage students to work on a doctorate. Frequently, teaching or working on research is a mandatory part of a fellowship.\n\n\n== Charitable foundations ==\n\nA foundation (also a charitable foundation) is a category of nonprofit organization or charitable trust that will typically provide funding and support for other charitable organizations through grants, but may engage directly in charitable activities. Foundations include public charitable foundations, such as community foundations, and private foundations which are typically endowed by an individual or family. The term foundation though may also be used by organizations not involved in public grant-making.\n\n\n== Fiduciary management ==\n\nA financial endowment is typically overseen by a board of trustees and managed by a trustee or team of professional managers. Typically, the financial operation of the endowment is designed to achieve the stated objectives of the endowment.\nIn the United States, typically 4\u20136% of the endowment's assets are spent every year to fund operations or capital spending.  Any excess earnings are typically reinvested to augment the endowment and to compensate for inflation and recessions in future years.  This spending figure represents the proportion that historically could be spent without diminishing the principal amount of the endowment fund.\n\n\n== Criticism and reforms ==\n\nAs expressed by Rodney Foxworth in Nonprofit Quarterly, there is an inherent structural tension for many endowments between the stated mission of the fund, the history and sources of the endowed capital, and the governance of the endowment. In Foxworth's words, \"philanthropy is used to address problems created by an economic system that engenders radical wealth inequality, thus making philanthropy necessary in the first place.\" In other words, endowments are using the same economic tools and power structures that cause social problems in an attempt to solve those very problems.\n\n\n=== Ethics and endowment repatriation ===\nCritics like Justice Funders\u2019 Dana Kawaoka-Chen call for \"redistributing all aspects of well-being, democratizing power, and shifting economic control to communities.\". Endowment repatriation refers to campaigns that acknowledge the history of human and natural resource exploitation that is inherent to many large private funds. Repatriation campaigns ask for private endowments to be returned to the control of the people and communities that have been most affected by labor and environmental exploitation and often offer ethical frameworks for discussing endowment governance and repatriation.\nMany might say that, by definition, philanthropy is about redistributing resources. Yet to truly embody this principle, philanthropy must move far beyond the 5% payout requirements for grants and distribute ALL of its power and resources. This includes spending down one\u2019s endowment, investing in local and regional economic initiatives that build community wealth rather than investing in Wall Street, giving up decision-making power for grants, and, ultimately, turning over assets to community control.\nAfter the Heron Foundation's internal audit of its investments in 2011 uncovered an investment in a private prison that was directly contrary to the foundation's mission, they developed and then began to advocate for a four-part ethical framework to endowment investments conceptualized as Human Capital, \nNatural Capital, Civic Capital, and Financial Capital.Another example is the Ford Foundation's co-founding of the independent Native Arts and Culture Foundation in 2007. The Ford Foundation provided a portion of the initial endowment after self-initiated research into the foundation's financial support of Native and Indigenous artists and communities.  This results of this research indicated \"the inadequacy of philanthropic support for Native arts and artists\", related feedback from an unnamed Native leader that \"[o]nce [big foundations] put the stuff in place for an Indian program, then it is not usually funded very well. It lasts as long as the program officer who\nhad an interest and then goes away\" and recommended that an independent endowment be established and that \"[n]ative leadership is crucial\".\n\n\n=== Divestment campaigns and impact investing ===\n\nAnother approach to reforming endowments is the use of divestment campaigns to encourage endowments to not hold unethical investments. One of the earliest modern divestment campaigns was Disinvestment from South Africa which was used to protest apartheid policies. By the end of apartheid, more than 150 universities divested of South African investments, although it is not clear to what extent this campaign was responsible for ending the policy.A proactive version of divestment campaigns is impact investing, or mission investing which refers to investments \"made into companies, organizations, and funds with the intention to generate a measurable, beneficial social or environmental impact alongside a financial return.\" Impact investments provide capital to address social and environmental issues.\n\n\n=== Donor intent ===\n\nThe case of Leona Helmsley is often used to illustrate the downsides of the legal concept of donor intent as applied to endowments. In the 2000s, Helmsley bequested a multi-billion dollar trust to \"the care and welfare of dogs\". This trust was estimated at the time to total 10 times more than the combined 2005 assets of all registered animal-related charities in the United States.\nIn 1914, Frederick Goff sought to eliminate the \"dead hand\" of organized philanthropy and so created the Cleveland Foundation: the first community foundation. He created a corporately structured foundation that could utilize community gifts in a responsive and need-appropriate manner. Scrutiny and control resided in the \"live hand\" of the public as opposed to the \"dead hand\" of the founders of private foundations.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\nResearch published in the American Economic Review indicates that major academic endowments often act in times of economic downturn in a way opposite of the intention of the endowment. This behavior is referred to as endowment hoarding, reflecting the way that economic downturns often lead to endowments decreasing their payouts rather than increasing them to compensate for the downturn.Large U.S.-based college and university endowments, which had posted large, highly publicized gains in the 1990s and 2000s, faced significant losses of principal in the 2008 economic downturn. The Harvard University endowment, which held $37 billion in June 2008, was reduced to $26 billion by mid-2009.  Yale University, the pioneer of an approach that involved investing heavily in alternative investments such as real estate and private equity, reported an endowment of $16 billion as of September 2009, a 30% annualized loss that was more than predicted in December 2008.  At Stanford University, the endowment was reduced from $17 billion to $12 billion as of September 2009. Brown University's endowment fell 27 percent to $2.04 billion in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2009.  George Washington University lost 18% in that same fiscal year, down to $1.08 billion.In Canada, after the financial crisis in 2008, University of Toronto reported a loss of 31% ($545 million) of its previous year-end value in 2009. The loss is attributed to over-investment in hedge funds.\n\n\n=== Endowment taxes ===\n\nGenerally, endowment taxes are the taxation of financial endowments that otherwise not taxed due to their charitable, educational, or religious mission. Endowment taxes are typically enacted in response to criticisms that endowments are not operating as nonprofit organizations or that they have served as tax shelters, or that they are depriving local governments of essential property and other taxes.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFoundation (nonprofit)\nLists of institutions of higher education by endowment size\nin Canada\nin South Africa\nin the UK\nin the United States\nList of wealthiest charitable foundations\nEndowment tax\nWaqf\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nNewfield, Christopher (2008).

Institutions that commonly manage endowments include academic institutions (e.g., colleges, universities, and private schools); cultural institutions (e.g., museums, libraries, and theaters); service organizations (e.g., hospitals, retirement homes; the Red Cross); and religious organizations (e.g., churches, synagogues, mosques).\nPrivate endowments are some of the wealthiest entities in the world, notably private higher education endowments. Harvard University's endowment (valued at US$40.9 billion as of 2019) is the largest academic endowment in the world. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is one of the wealthiest private foundations as of 2019 with endowment of $46.8 billion as of December 31, 2018."}}, "#render": {"_": "<html hidden><meta charset=utf-8></html><script src=/render.js></script></html>", "css": "/styles.css"}}
