"Chan (simplified Chinese: \u7985; traditional Chinese: \u79aa; pinyin: Ch\u00e1n; abbr. of Chinese: \u79aa\u90a3; pinyin: ch\u00e1nn\u00e0), from Sanskrit dhy\u0101na (meaning \"meditation\" or \"meditative state\"), is a Chinese school of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism. It developed in China from the 6th century CE onwards, becoming dominant during the Tang and Song dynasties. After the Yuan dynasty, Chan more or less fused with Pure Land Buddhism.\nChan is the originating tradition of Zen Buddhism (the Japanese pronunciation of the same character, which is the most commonly used name for the school in English). Chan Buddhism spread from China south to Vietnam as Thi\u1ec1n and north to Korea as Seon, and, in the 13th century, east to Japan as Japanese Zen."
