After Smith's death in 1844 the movement split into several groups following different leaders; the majority followed Brigham Young, while smaller groups followed Joseph Smith III, Sidney Rigdon, and James Strang. Most of these smaller groups eventually coalesced into the Community of Christ, and the term Mormon typically refers to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), as today this branch is far larger than all the others combined. (Since 2018, the LDS Church has requested that its members be referred to as \"Latter-day Saints\".) People who identify as Mormons may also be independently religious, secular and non-practicing, or belong to other denominations.\nMormons have developed a strong sense of community that stems from their doctrine and history. One of the central doctrinal issues that defined Mormonism in the 19th century was the practice of plural marriage, a form of religious polygamy. From 1852 until 1904, when the LDS Church banned the practice, many Mormons who had followed Brigham Young to the Utah Territory openly practiced polygamy.  Mormons dedicate significant time and resources to serving in their churches. A prominent practice among young and retired members of the LDS Church is to serve a full-time proselytizing mission. Mormons have a health code which eschews alcoholic beverages, tobacco, tea, coffee, and addictive substances. They tend to be very family-oriented and have strong connections across generations and with extended family, reflective of their belief that families can be sealed together beyond death. They also have a strict law of chastity, requiring abstention from sexual relations outside heterosexual marriage and fidelity within marriage, though the Community of Christ is accepting of LGBTQ individuals and relationships. \nMormons self-identify as Christian, but some non-Mormons consider Mormons to be non-Christian because some of their beliefs differ from those of Nicene Christianity. Mormons believe that Christ's church was restored through Joseph Smith and is guided by living prophets and apostles. Mormons believe in the Bible, as well as other books of scripture, such as the Book of Mormon. They have a unique view of cosmology and believe that all people are literal spirit-children of God. Mormons believe that returning to God requires following the example of Jesus Christ, and accepting his atonement through repentance and ordinances such as baptism.\nDuring the 19th century, Mormon converts tended to gather to a central geographic location, a trend that reversed somewhat in the 1920s and 30s. The center of Mormon cultural influence is in Utah, and North America has more Mormons than any other continent, although the majority of Mormons live outside the United States. As of December 2020, the LDS Church reported having 16,663,663 members worldwide.\n\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe word Mormon was originally coined to describe any person who believes in the Book of Mormon as a volume of scripture. The term Mormonite and Mormon were originally descriptive terms used by outsiders to the faith and occasionally used by church leaders. The term Mormon later evolved into a derogatory term, likely during the 1838 Mormon War, although the term was later adopted by Joseph Smith.Today, while the term Mormonism can act as a blanket term for all sects following the religious tradition started by Joseph Smith, many sects do not prefer the term Mormon as an acceptable label. For example, the largest sect, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, based in Salt Lake City, recently clarified in a style guide that it prefers the term Latter-day Saints among other acceptable terms. The term preferred by the Salt Lake-based LDS church has varied in the past, and at various points it has embraced the term Mormon and also stated that other sects within the shared faith tradition should not be called Mormon. The second largest sect, the Community of Christ, also rejects the term Mormon due to its association with the practice of polygamy among Brighamite sects. Other sects, including several fundamentalist branches of the Brighamite tradition, embrace the term Mormon.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe history of the Mormons has shaped them into a people with a strong sense of unity and commonality. From the start, Mormons have tried to establish what they call \"Zion\", a utopian society of the righteous.\nMormon history can be divided into three broad time periods: (1) the early history during the lifetime of Joseph Smith, (2) a \"pioneer era\" under the leadership of Brigham Young and his successors, and (3) a modern era beginning around the turn of the 20th century. In the first period, Smith attempted to build a city called Zion, in which converts could gather. During the pioneer era, Zion became a \"landscape of villages\" in Utah. In modern times, Zion is still an ideal, though Mormons gather together in their individual congregations rather than a central geographic location.\n\n\n=== Beginnings ===\n\nThe Mormon movement began with the publishing of the Book of Mormon in March 1830, which Smith claimed was a translation of golden plates containing the religious history of an ancient American civilization which had been compiled by the ancient prophet-historian Mormon. Smith claimed that an angel had directed him to the golden plates, buried in the Hill Cumorah. On April 6, 1830, Smith founded the Church of Christ. In 1832, Smith added an account of a vision he had sometime in the early 1820s while living in Upstate New York . This vision would come to be regarded by some Mormons as the most important event in human history after the birth, ministry, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.The early church grew westward as Smith sent missionaries to proselytize. In 1831, the church moved to Kirtland, Ohio where missionaries had made a large number of converts and Smith began establishing an outpost in Jackson County, Missouri, where he planned to eventually build the city of Zion (or the New Jerusalem). In 1833, Missouri settlers, alarmed by the rapid influx of Mormons, expelled them from Jackson County into the nearby Clay County, where local residents were more welcoming.\nAfter Smith led a mission, known as Zion's Camp, to recover the land, he began building Kirtland Temple in Lake County, Ohio, where the church flourished. When the Missouri Mormons were later asked to leave Clay County in 1836, they secured land in what would become Caldwell County.The Kirtland era ended in 1838, after the failure of a church-sponsored anti-bank caused widespread defections, and Smith regrouped with the remaining church in Far West, Missouri. During the fall of 1838, tensions escalated into the Mormon War with the old Missouri settlers. On October 27, the governor of Missouri ordered that the Mormons \"must be treated as enemies\" and be exterminated or driven from the state. Between November and April, some eight thousand displaced Mormons migrated east into Illinois.\n\nIn 1839, the Mormons purchased the small town of Commerce, converted swampland on the banks of the Mississippi River, and renamed the area Nauvoo, Illinois, and began construction of the Nauvoo Temple. The city became the church's new headquarters and gathering place, and it grew rapidly, fueled in part by converts immigrating from Europe. Meanwhile, Smith introduced temple ceremonies meant to seal families together for eternity, as well as the doctrines of eternal progression or exaltation, and plural marriage.\nSmith created a service organization for women called the Relief Society, as well as an organization called the Council of Fifty, representing a future theodemocratic \"Kingdom of God\" on the earth. Smith also published the story of his First Vision, in which the Father and the Son appeared to him while he was about 14 years old. This vision would come to be regarded by some Mormons as the most important event in human history after the birth, ministry, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.In 1844, local prejudices and political tensions, fueled by Mormon peculiarity, internal dissent, and reports of polygamy, escalated into conflicts between Mormons and \"anti-Mormons\" in Illinois and Missouri. Smith was arrested, and on June 27, 1844, he and his brother Hyrum were killed by a mob in Carthage, Illinois. Because Hyrum was Smith's logical successor, their deaths caused a succession crisis, and Brigham Young assumed leadership over the majority of Latter Day Saints. Young had been a close associate of Smith's and was senior apostle of the Quorum of the Twelve. Smaller groups of Latter Day Saints followed other leaders to form other denominations of the Latter Day Saint movement.\n\n\n=== Pioneer era ===\n\nFor two years after Smith's death, conflicts escalated between Mormons and other Illinois residents. To prevent war, Brigham Young led the Mormon pioneers (constituting most of the Latter Day Saints) to a temporary winter quarters in Nebraska and then, eventually (beginning in 1847), to what became the Utah Territory. Having failed to build Zion within the confines of American society, the Mormons began to construct a society in isolation, based on their beliefs and values. The cooperative ethic that Mormons had developed over the last decade and a half became important as settlers branched out and colonized a large desert region now known as the Mormon Corridor. Colonizing efforts were seen as religious duties, and the new villages were governed by the Mormon bishops (local lay religious leaders). The Mormons viewed land as commonwealth, devising and maintaining a co-operative system of irrigation that allowed them to build a farming community in the desert.From 1849 to 1852, the Mormons greatly expanded their missionary efforts, establishing several missions in Europe, Latin America, and the South Pacific. Converts were expected to \"gather\" to Zion, and during Young's presidency (1847\u201377) over seventy thousand Mormon converts immigrated to America. Many of the converts came from England and Scandinavia, and were quickly assimilated into the Mormon community. Many of these immigrants crossed the Great Plains in wagons drawn by oxen, while some later groups pulled their possessions in small handcarts. During the 1860s, newcomers began using the new railroad that was under construction.In 1852, church leaders publicized the previously secret practice of plural marriage, a form of polygamy. Over the next 50 years, many Mormons (between 20 and 30 percent of Mormon families) entered into plural marriages as a religious duty, with the number of plural marriages reaching a peak around 1860, and then declining through the rest of the century. Besides the doctrinal reasons for plural marriage, the practice made some economic sense, as many of the plural wives were single women who arrived in Utah without brothers or fathers to offer them societal support.\n\nBy 1857, tensions had again escalated between Mormons and other Americans, largely as a result of accusations involving polygamy and the theocratic rule of the Utah Territory by Brigham Young. In 1857, U.S. President James Buchanan sent an army to Utah, which Mormons interpreted as open aggression against them. Fearing a repeat of Missouri and Illinois, the Mormons prepared to defend themselves, determined to torch their own homes in the case that they were invaded. The relatively peaceful Utah War ensued from 1857 to 1858, in which the most notable instance of violence was the Mountain Meadows massacre, when leaders of a local Mormon militia ordered the killing of a civilian emigrant party that was traveling through Utah during the escalating tensions. In 1858, Young agreed to step down from his position as governor and was replaced by a non-Mormon, Alfred Cumming. Nevertheless, the LDS Church still wielded significant political power in the Utah Territory.At Young's death in 1877, he was followed by other LDS Church presidents, who resisted efforts by the United States Congress to outlaw Mormon polygamous marriages. In 1878, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Reynolds v. United States that religious duty was not a suitable defense for practicing polygamy, and many Mormon polygamists went into hiding; later, Congress began seizing church assets. In September 1890, church president Wilford Woodruff issued a Manifesto that officially suspended the practice of polygamy. Although this Manifesto did not dissolve existing plural marriages, relations with the United States markedly improved after 1890, such that Utah was admitted as a U.S. state in 1896. After the Manifesto, some Mormons continued to enter into polygamous marriages, but these eventually stopped in 1904 when church president Joseph F. Smith disavowed polygamy before Congress and issued a \"Second Manifesto\" calling for all plural marriages in the church to cease. Eventually, the church adopted a policy of excommunicating members found practicing polygamy, and today seeks actively to distance itself from \"fundamentalist\" groups that continue the practice.\n\n\n=== Modern times ===\n\nDuring the early 20th century, Mormons began to reintegrate into the American mainstream. In 1929, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir began broadcasting a weekly performance on national radio, becoming an asset for public relations. Mormons emphasized patriotism and industry, rising in socioeconomic status from the bottom among American religious denominations to middle-class.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Mormons began migrating out of Utah, a trend hurried by the Great Depression, as Mormons looked for work wherever they could find it. As Mormons spread out, church leaders created programs that would help preserve the tight-knit community feel of Mormon culture. In addition to weekly worship services, Mormons began participating in numerous programs such as Boy Scouting, a Young Women organization, church-sponsored dances, ward basketball, camping trips, plays, and religious education programs for youth and college students. During the Great Depression, the church started a welfare program to meet the needs of poor members, which has since grown to include a humanitarian branch that provides relief to disaster victims.\n\nDuring the later half of the 20th century, there was a retrenchment movement in Mormonism in which Mormons became more conservative, attempting to regain their status as a \"peculiar people\".\nThough the 1960s and 1970s brought changes such as Women's Liberation and the civil rights movement, Mormon leaders were alarmed by the erosion of traditional values, the sexual revolution, the widespread use of recreational drugs, moral relativism, and other forces they saw as damaging to the family.\nPartly to counter this, Mormons put an even greater emphasis on family life, religious education, and missionary work, becoming more conservative in the process. As a result, Mormons today are probably less integrated with mainstream society than they were in the early 1960s.Although black people have been members of Mormon congregations since Joseph Smith's time, before 1978, black membership was small. From 1852 to 1978, the LDS Church enforced a policy that restricted men of black African descent from being ordained to the church's lay priesthood. The church was sharply criticized for its policy during the civil rights movement, but the policy remained in force until a 1978 reversal that was prompted in part by questions about mixed-race converts in Brazil. In general, Mormons greeted the change with joy and relief. Since 1978, black membership has grown, and in 1997 there were approximately 500,000 black members of the church (about 5 percent of the total membership), mostly in Africa, Brazil and the Caribbean. Black membership has continued to grow substantially, especially in West Africa, where two temples have been built. Some black Mormons are members of the Genesis Group, an organization of black members that predates the priesthood ban, and is endorsed by the church.\n\nThe LDS Church grew rapidly after World War II and became a worldwide organization as missionaries were sent across the globe. The church doubled in size every 15 to 20 years, and by 1996, there were more Mormons outside the United States than inside. In 2012, there were an estimated 14.8 million Mormons, with roughly 57 percent living outside the United States. It is estimated that approximately 4.5 million Mormons \u2013 roughly 30% of the total membership \u2013 regularly attend services. A majority of U.S. Mormons are white and non-Hispanic (84 percent). Most Mormons are distributed in North and South America, the South Pacific, and Western Europe. The global distribution of Mormons resembles a contact diffusion model, radiating out from the organization's headquarters in Utah. The church enforces general doctrinal uniformity, and congregations on all continents teach the same doctrines, and international Mormons tend to absorb a good deal of Mormon culture, possibly because of the church's top-down hierarchy and a missionary presence. However, international Mormons often bring pieces of their own heritage into the church, adapting church practices to local cultures.As of December 2019, the LDS Church reported having 16,565,036 members worldwide. Chile, Uruguay, and several areas in the South Pacific have a higher percentage of Mormons than the United States (which is at about 2 percent). South Pacific countries and dependencies that are more than 10 percent Mormon include American Samoa, the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Niue, Samoa, and Tonga.\n\n\n== Culture and practices ==\n\nIsolation in Utah had allowed Mormons to create a culture of their own. As the faith spread around the world, many of its more distinctive practices followed. Mormon converts are urged to undergo lifestyle changes, repent of sins, and adopt sometimes atypical standards of conduct. Practices common to Mormons include studying scriptures, praying daily, fasting regularly, attending Sunday worship services, participating in church programs and activities on weekdays, and refraining from work on Sundays when possible. The most important part of the church services is considered to be the Lord's Supper (commonly called sacrament), in which church members renew covenants made at baptism. Mormons also emphasize standards they believe were taught by Jesus Christ, including personal honesty, integrity, obedience to law, chastity outside marriage and fidelity within marriage.In 2010, around 13\u201314 percent of Mormons lived in Utah, the center of cultural influence for Mormonism. Utah Mormons (as well as Mormons living in the Intermountain West) are on average more culturally and/or politically conservative than those living in some cosmopolitan centers elsewhere in the U.S. Utahns self-identifying as Mormon also attend church somewhat more on average than Mormons living in other states. (Nonetheless, whether they live in Utah or elsewhere in the U.S., Mormons tend to be more culturally and/or politically conservative than members of other U.S. religious groups.) Utah Mormons often place a greater emphasis on pioneer heritage than international Mormons who generally are not descendants of the Mormon pioneers.\n\nMormons have a strong sense of communality that stems from their doctrine and history. LDS Church members have a responsibility to dedicate their time and talents to helping the poor and building the church. The church is divided by locality into congregations called \"wards\", with several wards or branches to create a \"stake\". The vast majority of church leadership positions are lay positions, and church leaders may work 10 to 15 hours a week in unpaid church service. Observant Mormons also contribute 10 percent of their income to the church as tithing, and are often involved in humanitarian efforts. Many LDS young men, women and elderly couples choose to serve a proselytizing mission, during which they dedicate all of their time to the church, without pay.Mormons adhere to the Word of Wisdom, a health law or code that is interpreted as prohibiting the consumption of tobacco, alcohol, coffee and tea, while encouraging the use of herbs, grains, fruits, and a moderate consumption of meat. The Word of Wisdom is also understood to forbid other harmful and addictive substances and practices, such as the use of illegal drugs and abuse of prescription drugs. Mormons are encouraged to keep a year's supplies that include a food supply and a financial reserve. Mormons also oppose behaviors such as viewing pornography and gambling.The concept of a united family that lives and progresses forever is at the core of Latter-day Saint doctrine, and Mormons place a high importance on family life. Many Mormons hold weekly Family Home Evenings, in which an evening is set aside for family bonding, study, prayer and other activities they consider to be wholesome. Latter-day Saint fathers who hold the priesthood typically name and bless their children shortly after birth to formally give the child a name. Mormon parents hope and pray that their children will gain testimonies of the \"gospel\" so they can grow up and marry in temples.Mormons have a strict law of chastity, requiring abstention from sexual relations outside opposite-sex marriage and strict fidelity within marriage. All sexual activity (heterosexual and homosexual) outside marriage is considered a serious sin, with marriage recognized as only between a man and a woman. Same-sex marriages are not performed or supported by the LDS Church. Church members are encouraged to marry and have children, and Latter-day Saint families tend to be larger than average. Mormons are opposed to abortion, except in some exceptional circumstances, such as when pregnancy is the result of incest or rape, or when the life or health of the mother is in serious jeopardy. Many practicing adult Mormons wear religious undergarments that remind them of covenants and encourage them to dress modestly. Latter-day Saints are counseled not to partake of any form of media that is obscene or pornographic in any way, including media that depicts graphic representations of sex or violence. Tattoos and body piercings are also discouraged, with the exception of a single pair of earrings for LDS women.LGBT Mormons remain in good standing in the church if they abstain from homosexual relations and obey the law of chastity. While there are no official numbers, LDS Family Services estimates that there are on average four or five members per LDS ward who experience same-sex attraction. Gary Watts, former president of Family Fellowship, estimates that only 10 percent of homosexuals stay in the church. Many of these individuals have come forward through different support groups or websites discussing their homosexual attractions and concurrent church membership.\n\n\n== Groups within Mormonism ==\n\nNote that the categories below are not necessarily mutually exclusive.\n\n\n=== Latter-day Saints (\"LDS\") ===\n\nMembers of the LDS Church, also known as Latter-day Saints, constitute over 95 percent of Mormons. The beliefs and practices of LDS Mormons are generally guided by the teachings of LDS Church leaders. However, several smaller groups substantially differ from \"mainstream\" Mormonism in various ways.\nLDS Church members who do not actively participate in worship services or church callings are often called \"less-active\" or \"inactive\" (akin to the qualifying expressions non-observant or non-practicing used in relation to members of other religious groups). The LDS Church does not release statistics on church activity, but it is likely that about 40 percent of Mormons in the United States and 30 percent worldwide regularly attend worship services. Reasons for inactivity can include rejection of the fundamental beliefs and/or history of the church, lifestyle incongruities with doctrinal teachings, and problems with social integration. Activity rates tend to vary with age, and disengagement occurs most frequently between age 16 and 25. In 1998, the church reported a majority of less active members returned to church activity later in life. As of 2017, the LDS Church was losing millennial-age members, a phenomenon not unique to the LDS Church. Former Latter-day Saints who seek to disassociate themselves from the religion are often referred to as ex-Mormons.\n\n\n=== Fundamentalist Mormons ===\nMembers of sects that broke with the LDS Church over the issue of polygamy have become known as fundamentalist Mormons; these groups differ from mainstream Mormonism primarily in their belief in and practice of plural marriage. There are thought to be between 20,000 and 60,000 members of fundamentalist sects, (0.1\u20130.4 percent of Mormons), with roughly half of them practicing polygamy. There are a number of fundamentalist sects, the largest two being the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church) and the Apostolic United Brethren (AUB). In addition to plural marriage, some of these groups also practice a form of Christian communalism known as the law of consecration or the United Order. The LDS Church seeks to distance itself from all such polygamous groups, excommunicating their members if discovered practicing or teaching it, and today a majority of Mormon fundamentalists have never been members of the LDS Church.\n\n\n=== Liberal Mormons ===\n\nLiberal Mormons, also known as Progressive Mormons, take an interpretive approach to LDS teachings and scripture. They look to the scriptures for spiritual guidance, but may not necessarily believe the teachings to be literally or uniquely true. For liberal Mormons, revelation is a process through which God gradually brings fallible human beings to greater understanding. A person in this group is sometimes mistakenly regarded by others within the mainstream church as a Jack Mormon, although this term is more commonly used to describe a different group with distinct motives to live the gospel in a non-traditional manner. Liberal Mormons place doing good and loving fellow human beings above the importance of believing correctly. In a separate context, members of small progressive breakaway groups have also adopted the label.\n\n\n=== Cultural Mormons ===\nCultural Mormons are individuals who may not believe in certain doctrines or practices of the institutional LDS Church yet identify as members of the Mormon ethnic identity. Usually this is a result of having been raised in the LDS faith, or as having converted and spent a large portion of one's life as an active member of the LDS Church. Cultural Mormons may or may not be actively involved with the LDS Church. In some cases they may not be members of the LDS Church.\n\n\n== Beliefs ==\n\nMormons have a scriptural canon consisting of the Bible (both Old and New Testaments), the Book of Mormon, and a collection of revelations and writings by Joseph Smith known as the Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price. Mormons, however, have a relatively open definition of scripture. As a general rule, anything spoken or written by a prophet, while under inspiration, is considered to be the word of God. Thus, the Bible, written by prophets and apostles, is the word of God, so far as it is translated correctly. The Book of Mormon is also believed to have been written by ancient prophets, and is viewed as a companion to the Bible. By this definition, the teachings of Smith's successors are also accepted as scripture, though they are always measured against, and draw heavily from the scriptural canon.\n\nMormons believe in \"a friendly universe\", governed by a God whose aim it is to bring his children to immortality and eternal life. Mormons have a unique perspective on the nature of God, the origin of man, and the purpose of life. For instance, Mormons believe in a pre-mortal existence where people were literal spirit children of God, and that God presented a plan of salvation that would allow his children to progress and become more like him. The plan involved the spirits receiving bodies on earth and going through trials in order to learn, progress, and receive a \"fulness of joy\". The most important part of the plan involved Jesus, the eldest of God's children, coming to earth as the literal Son of God, to conquer sin and death so that God's other children could return. According to Mormons, every person who lives on earth will be resurrected, and nearly all of them will be received into various kingdoms of glory. To be accepted into the highest kingdom, a person must fully accept Christ through faith, repentance, and through ordinances such as baptism and the laying on of hands.\n\nAccording to Mormons, a deviation from the original principles of Christianity, known as the Great Apostasy, began not long after the ascension of Jesus Christ. It was marked with the corruption of Christian doctrine by Greek and other philosophies, with followers dividing into different ideological groups. Mormons claim the martyrdom of the apostles led to a loss of priesthood authority to administer the church and its ordinances.\nMormons believe that God restored the early Christian church through Joseph Smith. In particular, Mormons believe that angels such as Peter, James, John, John the Baptist, Moses, and Elijah appeared to Smith and others and bestowed various priesthood authorities on them. Mormons believe that their church is the \"only true and living church\" because of the divine authority restored through Smith. Mormons self-identify as being Christian, while many Christians, particularly evangelical Protestants, disagree with this view. Mormons view other religions as having portions of the truth, doing good works, and having genuine value.The LDS Church has a top-down hierarchical structure with a president\u2013prophet dictating revelations for the entire church. Lay Mormons are also believed to have access to inspiration, and are encouraged to seek their own personal revelations. Mormons see Joseph Smith's First Vision as proof that the heavens are open, and that God answers prayers. They place considerable emphasis on \"asking God\" to find out if something is true. Most Mormons do not claim to have had heavenly visions like Smith's in response to prayers, but feel that God talks to them in their hearts and minds through the Holy Ghost. Though Mormons have some beliefs that are considered strange in a modernized world, they continue to hold onto their beliefs because they feel God has spoken to them.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of Latter Day Saints\nList of denominations in the Latter Day Saint movement: Followers of Brigham Young\nList of former or dissident LDS\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nchurchofjesuschrist.org and comeuntochrist.org, official websites of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\nMormons page at the Public Broadcasting Service", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Christus_statue_temple_square_salt_lake_city.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Crossing_the_Mississippi_on_the_Ice_by_C.C.A._Christensen.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Flag_of_Argentina.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Flag_of_Chile.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Flag_of_Mexico.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Flag_of_Peru.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Flag_of_the_Philippines.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Global_thinking.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Igreja_SUD_uruguaiana_rs.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Joseph_Preaching_to_the_Indians_by_C.C.A._Christensen.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Joseph_Smith_first_vision_stained_glass.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/LDS_Global_Distribution_%282009%29.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Latter_Day_Saint_confirmation_%28Mayhew_1852%29.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Mormon_Pioneer_handcart_statue.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/Mtchoirandorchestra_ConferenceCenter.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/P_christianity.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Salt_Lake_Temple%2C_Utah_-_Sept_2004-2.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/05/Flag_of_Brazil.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e2/Symbol_portal_class.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg"], "summary": "Mormons are a religious and cultural group related to Mormonism, the principal branch of the Latter Day Saint movement started by Joseph Smith in upstate New York during the 1820s. After Smith's death in 1844 the movement split into several groups following different leaders; the majority followed Brigham Young, while smaller groups followed Joseph Smith III, Sidney Rigdon, and James Strang. Most of these smaller groups eventually coalesced into the Community of Christ, and the term Mormon typically refers to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), as today this branch is far larger than all the others combined. (Since 2018, the LDS Church has requested that its members be referred to as \"Latter-day Saints\".) People who identify as Mormons may also be independently religious, secular and non-practicing, or belong to other denominations.\nMormons have developed a strong sense of community that stems from their doctrine and history. One of the central doctrinal issues that defined Mormonism in the 19th century was the practice of plural marriage, a form of religious polygamy. From 1852 until 1904, when the LDS Church banned the practice, many Mormons who had followed Brigham Young to the Utah Territory openly practiced polygamy.  Mormons dedicate significant time and resources to serving in their churches. A prominent practice among young and retired members of the LDS Church is to serve a full-time proselytizing mission. Mormons have a health code which eschews alcoholic beverages, tobacco, tea, coffee, and addictive substances. They tend to be very family-oriented and have strong connections across generations and with extended family, reflective of their belief that families can be sealed together beyond death. They also have a strict law of chastity, requiring abstention from sexual relations outside heterosexual marriage and fidelity within marriage, though the Community of Christ is accepting of LGBTQ individuals and relationships. \nMormons self-identify as Christian, but some non-Mormons consider Mormons to be non-Christian because some of their beliefs differ from those of Nicene Christianity. Mormons believe that Christ's church was restored through Joseph Smith and is guided by living prophets and apostles. Mormons believe in the Bible, as well as other books of scripture, such as the Book of Mormon. They have a unique view of cosmology and believe that all people are literal spirit-children of God. Mormons believe that returning to God requires following the example of Jesus Christ, and accepting his atonement through repentance and ordinances such as baptism.\nDuring the 19th century, Mormon converts tended to gather to a central geographic location, a trend that reversed somewhat in the 1920s and 30s. The center of Mormon cultural influence is in Utah, and North America has more Mormons than any other continent, although the majority of Mormons live outside the United States. As of December 2020, the LDS Church reported having 16,663,663 members worldwide."}, "Nauvoo_Temple": {"links": ["Nauvoo, Illinois", "Beehive House", "Temple Square", "Harper's Magazine", "Ordinance ", "Wesley P.

The church's first temple was completed in Kirtland, Ohio, United States, in 1836. When the main body of the church was forced out of Nauvoo, Illinois, in the winter of 1846, the church attempted to sell the building, finally succeeding in 1848. The building was damaged by fire and a tornado before being demolished.\nIn 1937, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) reacquired the lot on which the original temple had stood. In 2000, the church began to build a temple on the original site with an exterior that is a replica of the first temple, but whose interior is laid out like a modern Latter-day Saint temple. On June 27, 2002, a date that coincided with the 158th anniversary of the death of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, the temple was dedicated by the LDS Church as the Nauvoo Illinois Temple.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe Latter Day Saints made preparations to build a temple soon after establishing their headquarters at Nauvoo, Illinois, in 1839. On April 6, 1841, the temple's cornerstone was laid under the direction of Joseph Smith, the church founder and president; Sidney Rigdon gave the principal oration. At its base the building was 128 feet (39 m) long and 88 feet (27 m) wide with a clock tower and weather vane reaching to  a total height of 165 feet (50 m)\u2014a 60% increase over the dimensions of the Kirtland Temple. Like Kirtland, the Nauvoo Temple contained two assembly halls, one on the first floor and one on the second, called the lower and upper courts. Both had classrooms and offices in the attic. Unlike Kirtland, the Nauvoo Temple had a full basement which housed a baptismal font. Because the Saints had to abandon Nauvoo, the building was not entirely completed. The basement with its font was finished, as were the first floor assembly hall and the attic. When these parts of the building were completed they were used for performing ordinances (basement and attic) or for worship services (first floor assembly hall).\n\nThe Nauvoo Temple was designed in the Greek Revival style by architect William Weeks, under the direction of Joseph Smith. Weeks's design made use of distinctively Latter Day Saint motifs, including sunstones, moonstones, and starstones. It is often mistakenly thought that these stones represent the three degrees of glory in the Latter Day Saint conception of the afterlife, but the stones appear in the wrong order. Instead, Wandle Mace, foreman for the framework of the Nauvoo Temple, has explained that the design of the temple was meant to be \"a representation of the Church, the Bride, the Lamb's wife\". In this regard, Mace references John's statement in Revelation 12:1 concerning the \"woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.\" This explains why the starstones are at the top of the temple (\"crown of twelve stars\"), the sunstones in the middle (\"clothed with the sun\") and the moonstones at the bottom (\"moon under her feet\").\nConstruction was only half complete at the death of Joseph Smith in 1844. After a succession crisis, Brigham Young was sustained as the church's leader by the majority of Latter Day Saints in Nauvoo. As mob violence increased during the summer of 1845, he encouraged the Latter Day Saints to complete the temple even as they prepared to abandon the city, so portions of it could be used for Latter Day Saint ordinance, such as baptisms for the dead in the basement font. During the winter of 1845\u201346, the temple began to be used for additional ordinances, including the Nauvoo-era endowment, sealings in marriage, and adoptions. The Nauvoo Temple was in use for less than three months.\nMost of the Latter Day Saints left Nauvoo, beginning in February 1846, but a small crew remained to finish the temple's first floor, so that it could be formally dedicated. Once the first floor was finished with pulpits and benches, the building was finally dedicated in private services on April 30, 1846, and in public services on 1 May. In September 1846 the remaining Latter Day Saints were driven from the city and vigilantes from the neighboring region, including Carthage, Illinois, entered the near-empty city and vandalized the temple.\nInitially the church's agents tried to lease the structure, first to the Catholic Church, and then to private individuals. When this failed, they attempted to sell the temple, asking up to $200,000, but this effort also met with no success. On March 11, 1848, the LDS Church's agents sold the building to David T. LeBaron, for $5,000. Finally, the New York Home Missionary Society expressed interest in leasing the building as a school, but around midnight on October 8\u20139, 1848, the temple was set on fire by an unknown arsonist. Nauvoo's residents attempted to put out the fire, but the temple was gutted. James J. Strang, leader of the Strangite faction of Latter Day Saints, accused Young's agents of setting fire to the temple. However, Strang's charges were never proven. On April 2, 1849, LeBaron sold the damaged temple to \u00c9tienne Cabet for $2,000. Cabet, whose followers were called Icarians, hoped to establish Nauvoo as a communistic utopia.\n\n\n=== Destruction ===\n\nAfter the fire of October 9, 1848, only the four exterior walls remained standing. The Icarian leader Cabet was fascinated by the temple and planned to reconstruct it, and a considerable amount of money was spent in the endeavor.  However, on May 27, 1850, Nauvoo was struck by a major tornado which toppled one of the walls of the temple. One source claimed the storm seemed to \"single out the Temple\", felling \"the walls with a roar that was heard miles away\". Cabet ordered the demolition of two more walls in the interests of public safety, leaving only the fa\u00e7ade standing. The Icarians used much of the temple's stone to build a new school building on the southwest corner of the temple lot. By 1857, however, most of Cabet's followers had left Nauvoo and over time many of the original stones for the temple were used in the construction of other buildings throughout Hancock County. In February 1865, Nauvoo's City Council ordered the final demolition of the last standing portion of the temple\u2014one lone corner of the fa\u00e7ade. Soon afterwards, all evidence of the temple disappeared, except for a hand pump over a well that supplied water to the baptismal font. Three of the original sunstones are known to have survived and are on display\u2014one is on loan to LDS Church's Visitor Center in Nauvoo, one is in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C, and the third and only one that has not been restored is displayed, along with the only moonstone on display, at the Joseph Smith Historic Center of the Community of Christ.\n\n\n== Nauvoo Illinois Temple ==\n\nFrom 1937 to 1962, the LDS Church reacquired and restored the lot on which the temple stood. In 1999, church president Gordon B. Hinckley announced the rebuilding of the temple on its original footprint. After two years of construction, on June 27, 2002, the church dedicated the Nauvoo Illinois Temple, whose exterior is a replica of the first temple, but whose interior is laid out like a modern LDS temple.\n\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nAt its base the Nauvoo Temple was 128 feet (39 m) long and 88 feet (27 m) wide with a tower and weather vane reaching to 164 feet (50 m).  The second temple of the Latter Day Saint movement  was built 60 percent larger in dimensions than its predecessor, the Kirtland Temple. Like Kirtland, the temple contained two assembly halls, one on the first floor and one on the second, called the lower and upper courts. Both had classrooms and offices in the attic. Unlike Kirtland, it had a full basement which housed a baptismal font.\n\n\n=== Exterior ===\nThe limestone used for the original temple was quarried from a site just west of the temple. Much of that quarry, however, was submerged by rising water behind the Keokuk Dam in 1912. Therefore, Russellville, Alabama, subsidiary of Minnesota's Vetter Stone Company, was chosen by the Church to provide stone for the new temple. Church officials say the quarry was selected because it provided stone that is a close match to the limestone originally used.\n\n\n=== Basement ===\n\nThe basement of the Nauvoo Temple was used as the baptistry, containing a large baptismal font in the center of the main room.\nThe basement was accessed by spiral staircases at the northwest and southwest corners of the temple. The staircase landing was made of wood and opened to a short hallway heading east, leading to the basement proper. Between the two hallways was an unfinished room sealed off from the rest of the temple, containing an old well that had been dug but never used.  The room was discovered by an anti-Mormon mob who broke through the floor of the vestibule above.The basement proper was one hundred feet long and forty feet wide with six rooms of varying sizes on either side. The sides of the rooms were stone and abutted the massive stone piers that supported the floors above. With the exception of the two rooms at the western end of the basement, reportedly used for clerical purposes, each side room rose two steps in height from the basement floor. The rooms were dressing rooms for those using the font. The floor was made of red brick laid in a herringbone pattern. The walls were painted white. The floor sloped down to the center of the room to allow water to run toward a drain beneath the font.During an archaeological investigation of the temple site, two highly polished limestone blocks were discovered. Approximately twelve feet east of the entrance to the baptistry and ten feet from either the side of the support piers rested the blocks, roughly fourteen inches square, which projected seven inches (178 mm) above the brick floor. These objects are not mentioned in any account of the basement, and their purpose is unknown. They may have held some type of support columns, dividing the font from the entrance to the basement, or they may simply have been a decorative element beneath a vase or something similar.  They may have been part of a feature planned, but not used, in the final construction.\n\n\n==== The baptismal font ====\n\nEvery visitor who wrote about the temple mentioned the baptismal font. It was clearly the most impressive feature of the temple.  There were actually two fonts built during the lifetime of the temple, a temporary wooden one, and a permanent limestone one.The first font was built out of tongue and grooved white pine and painted white. It was sixteen feet long, twelve feet wide and four feet deep. The lip of the font was seven feet from the floor. The font's cap and base were carved molding in an \"antique style\" and the sides were finished with panel work.  Two railed stairways led to the font from the north and south sides.The font was held up by twelve oxen as are almost all temple fonts. They were carved from pine planking that was glued together. They were patterned from the most beautiful five-year-old steer that could be found in the region. The head, shoulders and legs protruded beyond the base of the font, and they appeared to have sunk to their knees into the pavement. The most perfect horn that could be found was used to model the animals' horns.A decision was made to replace the wooden font in 1845, apparently because the water caused a mildew odor, and possibly because the wood had begun to rot. The new limestone font followed the pattern of the wooden one. Twelve oxen held up the basin, four on each side and two at each end. The oxen were solid stone and similarly were placed and appeared sunken into the floor. Where the oxen met the basin, the stone was carved to suggest drapery.  The ears of the oxen were made of tin. The stairs were moved to an east/west orientation making access to the font easier.A well on the east side of the font provided the water supply.  There may have been some kind of tank at the eastern end of the baptistry to store and heat water.\n\n\n=== The vestibule ===\n\nA flight of eight broad steps led to a landing where two more steps entered three archways.  These archways led to the vestibule, the formal entrance to the temple.\nThe archways were approximately nine feet wide and twenty-one feet high.\nThe vestibule itself was forty-three feet by seventeen feet in dimension.  It was composed of limestone on all four of its walls. The floor has been speculated to be made of wood, because when the mob occupied the temple briefly in late 1847, they broke through the floor to reach a sealed off room in the basement.  Had the floor been limestone, it seems unlikely that they would have dug it up.\nTwo large double doors on the east wall opened to the first floor assembly hall of the lower court, known as the \"Great Hall\". Two doors, one on the North wall, and another on the South opened to the landing of two spiral staircases, one in the Northwest corner, and the other in the Southwest corner which led all the way to the attic.  These were the only access points to the rest of the building.\nOne report stated that on the east wall of the vestibule was an entablature, similar to the one in the facade, which read in bright gilded letters, \"THE HOUSE OF THE LORD - Built by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints - Commenced April 6th, 1841 - HOLINESS TO THE LORD.\"\n\n\n=== The stairwells ===\nThe two stairwells were constructed of dressed limestone walls. One rose from Northwest corner and the other at the Southwest corner of the temple.  They were not true circles but were flatted on four sides. Nor were they symmetrical, being sixteen feet in diameter from East to West and seventeen feet in diameter from North to South. This was done to support landings and other support structures.The staircases, made of wood, provided access to all of the temple from the basement to the attic with a landing at each floor. They had lamps for illumination at night, and had windows for daytime illumination. William Weeks' elevation of the front facade does not show windows at the basement level of the two stairwells, and photographic evidence is inconclusive. However, Joseph Smith's youngest son, David Smith, rendered a painting of the temple's damaged facade, clearly shows half-circular windows at the basement level in the north and south corners of the facade.The staircase in the northwest corner was never completed. It was roughed in with temporary boards resting on the risers. Workmen used this staircase to gain access to the building during its construction, especially during the winter of 1845-1846 when persons were using the other staircase to reach the attic for ordinance work. The southwest staircase was completely finished for use.  It included lamps for night illumination, and may have been carpeted near the attic landing.\n\n\n=== The Great Hall ===\nEntrance to the first floor assembly hall, called the \"Great Hall\", was through two large double doors at the east end of the vestibule. The Great Hall occupied the remainder of the floor space East of the vestibule. The room was flanked on either side by seven large, arched windows, with four similar windows along the east wall. An arched ceiling spanned some fifty feet in breadth, in the center. the floor was stained wood and the walls were painted white.There were two rooms to the north just past the entrance. It has been suggested that these rooms were used initially by William Weeks, because they are referred by Thomas Bullock as the \"architect's room.\" Their eventual intended use is not clear.\n\n\n==== Pulpits ====\nAt the east and west ends of the hall were two sets of similar pulpits. Resembling the pulpits used in the Kirtland Temple, and repeated in later temples, they were arranged with four levels, the top three consisting of a group of three semi-circular stands.  The lowest level was a drop-table which was raised for use in the sacrament.The pulpits to the east, standing between the windows, were reserved for the Melchizedek Priesthood.  Accordingly, each pulpit had initials identifying the priesthood office of the occupant. The top most pulpits read P.H.P., which stood for President of the High Priesthood. The next level down had P.S.Q for President of the Seventy Quorums. Below that, the labels were P.H.Q. which stood for President of the High priests Quorum, and the folding table had the inscription P.E.Q. standing for President of the Elders Quorum.Above the Eastern pulpits, written in gilded letters, along the arch of the ceiling, were the words,\"The Lord Has Seen Our Sacrifice - Come After Us.\"The pulpits to the West end were reserved for the Aaronic Priesthood. Each pulpit similarly had initials identifying the priesthood officers who occupied that stand. The highest three pulpits bore the initials P.A.P., which stood for President of the Aaronic Priesthood. The next lower pulpits had P.P.Q., for President of the Priests Quorum.  Again, the next had P.T.Q., for President of the Teachers Quorum and on the table at the bottom was written P.D.Q., for President of the Deacons Quorum.\n\n\n==== Pews ====\nSimilar to the Kirtland Temple, the hall was fitted with enclosed pews with two aisles running down its length. There were also pews for a band and choir.  The room could accommodate up to 3,500 people. Because there were pulpits on both ends of the room, the pews had movable backs which could be swung to face either direction, depending on who was presiding - the Melchizedek Priesthood or the Aaronic Priesthood.\n\n\n=== First floor mezzanine ===\n\nAccess to the first floor mezzanine was directly from landings of the two staircases in the west end of the building. A foyer, corresponding in size to the vestibule below, connected the two stairway landings.\nEvidence suggests that this mezzanine had fourteen small rooms, seven along each side of the North and South wall. Each room had a small circular window supplying light. These rooms may never have been completed, except perhaps some kind of partition dividing them.\n\n\n=== Second floor assembly hall ===\n\nThe second floor hall was similar in construction to the Great Hall, except that it included the foyer area where the vestibule would be.  This made the room about seventeen feet longer. A 41-foot-long (12 m) stone arch ran north and south between the circular stairwells supporting the massive timbers for the tower above. It had seven large windows along the north and south wide, with four windows along the east wall.The floor would have a similar configuration as the Great Hall with a set of double pulpits and pews, but the room was never completed.  Doors were never hung, the plastering was unfinished, and the floorboards were only rough timber, not the tongue and grove finished hardwoods of the other floors. The room, when used for an occasional meeting, was furnished with wooden benches.\n\n\n=== Second floor mezzanine rooms ===\n\nThe second mezzanine was similar to the first floor mezzanine.  It was accessed via the two staircases at the West end of the building.  There was no foyer connecting the two stairwells.The second floor mezzanine is also presumed to have been divided into fourteen small rooms, seven rooms along each side of the North and South walls of the building, between the arched ceiling of the second floor. Circular windows in the entablature of the building allowed for illumination. Just as with the second floor assembly room, there is no evidence that these rooms were ever completed, except perhaps for the partitions dividing each room. There was a staircase in the second room from the Southeast corner leading to a room above, providing another access method to the attic.\n\n\n=== Attic ===\n\nAt the top of the two stairways, opening to a foyer, was the attic floor. The attic was not built of limestone but of wood. It was composed of two sections.  The West end of the temple was a flat roofed section that supported the tower. The rest of the attic was a pitched-roof section running the length of the temple.The flat-room section was further divided into two sections, the foyer on the west side, and a suite of rooms to the east. When the attic was used for ordinance work, they were used as a pantry, wardrobe and storage rooms. The area was illuminated by six windows along the foyer's west wall. Outside windows also provided light along the north and south sides. The roof had four octagonal skylight windows to provide light to the interior rooms, in addition to a twenty-foot arched window.The incline of the roof prevented a six-foot-tall man from standing erect along the outside wall. The second room from the south-east corner had a stairway leading to a room in the mezzanine below.\n\n\n=== Tower rooms ===\nRising from the plateau of the attic is an octagonal tower. The tower was divided into three sections, each accessible by a series of stairways leading from the attic to an observation deck at the top. The lowest section was the belfry. The bell was rung for various occasions. Between the observation deck and the belfry was a section containing the four clockwork mechanisms.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nComparison of temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\nJoseph Toronto\nList of temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\nList of temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints by geographic region\nTemple architecture (LDS Church)\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nBrown, Lisle G.

The church's first temple was completed in Kirtland, Ohio, United States, in 1836. When the main body of the church was forced out of Nauvoo, Illinois, in the winter of 1846, the church attempted to sell the building, finally succeeding in 1848. The building was damaged by fire and a tornado before being demolished.\nIn 1937, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) reacquired the lot on which the original temple had stood. In 2000, the church began to build a temple on the original site with an exterior that is a replica of the first temple, but whose interior is laid out like a modern Latter-day Saint temple. On June 27, 2002, a date that coincided with the 158th anniversary of the death of Joseph and Hyrum Smith, the temple was dedicated by the LDS Church as the Nauvoo Illinois Temple."}, "Endowment_": {"links": ["Taxation of private equity and hedge funds", "Doctorate", "Capital call", "List of Canadian universities by endowment", "List of colleges and universities in the United States by endowment", "Impact investing", "Lucasian Professor of Mathematics", "Paul Revere", "Nonprofit organization", "Khaybar", "Venture capital financing", "Private equity in the one thousand, nine hundred and eightys", "George Washington University", "Tax shelter", "Henry VIII of England", "Philosophy", "High-net-worth individual", "Leona Helmsley", "Carried interest", "American Economic Review", "Post-money valuation", "Private equity", "Trust ", "Endowment hoarding", "Professor", "The Wall Street Journal", "Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act", "Louvre", "Venture capital trust", "Mezzanine capital", "Corporate venture capital", "Distribution waterfall", "Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization", "Muslim", "NDL ", "two thousand and eight economic downturn", "Athens", "Internal rate of return", "Commercial bank", "Business Development Company", "Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation", "Limited partnership", "Startup company", "Capitalization table", "LCCN ", "Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica", "Paola, Kansas", "Paris", "College and university rankings", "Financial instrument", "Private equity secondary market", "Aristotelianism", "Madrasa", "Umar", "Dividend recapitalization", "Publicly traded private equity", "Leveraged recapitalization", "Epicureanism", "NARA ", "Lady Margaret Beaufort", "Charitable organization", "Lady Margaret's Professor of Divinity", "Scholarship", "Private investment in public equity", "Payment in lieu of taxes", "The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation", "Undercapitalization", "Harvard University endowment", "Isaac Newton", "Lists of institutions of higher education by endowment size", "College", "Business incubator", "List of South African universities by endowment", "History of private equity and venture capital", "American Economic Association", "Emperor", "Frederick Goff", "Principal ", "American Institute of Certified Public Accountants", "Merchant bank", "University of Toronto", "Equity co-investment", "Private-equity fund", "Pledge fund", "Growth capital", "Mergers and acquisitions", "Private equity in the two thousands", "Pension fund", "University of Cambridge", "Charitable trust", "Disinvestment from South Africa", "Harvard College", "Limited liability company", "Waqf", "Stoicism", "Investment banking", "Trustee", "The Cleveland Foundation", "Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity ", "Family office", "Buy\u2013sell agreement", "The Tech ", "Endowment invasion", "Crowdfunding", "Divisional buyout", "Stephen Hawking", "Insurance", "Roman Empire", "Yale University", "Boston Herald", "List of UK universities by endowment", "Leveraged buyout", "Leverage ", "Wayback Machine", "List of wealthiest charitable foundations", "Platonism", "Muhammad", "Venture capital", "Disinvestment", "Pre-money valuation", "Buyout", "Universities", "Private equity in the one thousand, nine hundred and ninetys", "Sovereign wealth fund", "Arabic language", "Stanford University", "University of Glasgow", "Angel investor", "Endowment tax", "High-yield debt", "Native Arts and Culture Foundation", "Early history of private equity", "Assets under management", "Capital structure", "Foundation ", "Jihad", "University", "Venture debt", "Regius Professorships", "Liquidation preference", "Management buyout", "Community foundation", "Vintage year", "Private school", "ISBN ", "Management fee", "Fossil fuel divestment", "University of Oxford", "Venture round", "Ford Foundation", "Public Market Equivalent", "Abbasid dynasty", "Envy ratio", "Fund of funds", "Sharia", "Space Needle", "Divestment", "International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement", "Capital commitment", "Real estate", "Private foundation", "Private-equity firm", "Institutional investor", "Donor intent", "San Francisco Chronicle", "Cy-pr\u00e8s doctrine", "Initial public offering", "Seed money", "Financial sponsor", "Brown University", "Istanbul", "The GW Hatchet", "Ford Foundation Building", "Marcus Aurelius", "Mortmain", "Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum", "Central Wakf Council", "Doi ", "Return on investment"], "content": "A financial endowment is a legal structure for managing, and in many cases indefinitely perpetuating, a pool of financial, real estate, or other investments for a specific purpose according to the will of its founders and donors. Endowments are often structured so that the principal value is kept intact, while the investment income or a small part of the principal is available for use each year.\n\nEndowments are often governed and managed either as a nonprofit corporation, a charitable foundation, or a private foundation that, while serving a good cause, might not qualify as a public charity. In some jurisdictions, it is common for endowed funds to be established as a trust independent of the organizations and the causes the endowment is meant to serve. Institutions that commonly manage endowments include academic institutions (e.g., colleges, universities, and private schools); cultural institutions (e.g., museums, libraries, and theaters); service organizations (e.g., hospitals, retirement homes; the Red Cross); and religious organizations (e.g., churches, synagogues, mosques).\nPrivate endowments are some of the wealthiest entities in the world, notably private higher education endowments. Harvard University's endowment (valued at US$40.9 billion as of 2019) is the largest academic endowment in the world. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is one of the wealthiest private foundations as of 2019 with endowment of $46.8 billion as of December 31, 2018.\n\n\n== Types ==\nMost private endowments in the United States are governed by the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act which is based in part on the concept of donor intent that helps define what restrictions are imposed on the principal and earnings of the fund. Endowments in the United States are commonly categorized in one of four ways:\nUnrestricted endowment can be used in any way the recipient chooses to carry out its mission.\nTerm endowment funds stipulate that all or part of the principal may be expended only after the expiration of a stated period of time or occurrence of a specified event, depending on donor wishes.\nQuasi endowment funds are designated endowments by an organization's governing body rather than by the donor. Therefore both the principal and the income may be accessed at the organization's discretion. Quasi endowment funds are still subject to any other donor restrictions or intent.\nRestricted endowments ensure that the original principal is held in perpetuity and that the earnings from this original principal are allocated according to the donor's requirements.\n\n\n== Restrictions and donor intent ==\nEndowment revenue can be restricted by donors to serve many purposes. Endowed professorships or scholarships restricted to a particular subject are common; in some places a donor could fund a trust exclusively for the support of a pet. Ignoring the restriction is called \"invading\" the endowment. But change of circumstance or financial duress like bankruptcy can preclude carrying out the donor's intent.  A court can alter the use of restricted endowment under a doctrine called cy-pr\u00e8s meaning to find an alternative \"as near as possible\" to the donor's intent.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest endowed chairs were established by the Roman emperor and Stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius in Athens in AD 176. Aurelius created one endowed chair for each of the major schools of philosophy: Platonism, Aristotelianism, Stoicism, and Epicureanism. Later, similar endowments were set up in some other major cities of the Empire.The earliest universities were founded in Asia and Africa. Their endowment by a prince or monarch and their role in training government officials made early Mediterranean universities similar to Islamic madrasas, although madrasas were generally smaller, and individual teachers, rather than the madrasa itself, granted the license or degree.Waqf (Arabic: \u0648\u064e\u0642\u0652\u0641\u200e; [\u02c8w\u0251qf]), also known as 'hubous' (\u062d\u064f\u0628\u0648\u0633) or mortmain property, is a similar concept from  Islamic law, which typically involves donating a building, plot of land or other assets for Muslim religious or charitable purposes with no intention of reclaiming the assets. The donated assets may be held by a charitable trust.\n\nIbn Umar reported, Umar Ibn Al-Khattab got land in Khaybar, so he came to the prophet Muhammad and asked him to advise him about it. The Prophet said, 'If you like, make the property inalienable and give the profit from it to charity.'\" It goes on to say that Umar gave it away as alms, that the land itself would not be sold, inherited or donated. He gave it away for the poor, the relatives, the slaves, the jihad, the travelers and the guests. And it will not be held against him who administers it if he consumes some of its yield in an appropriate manner or feeds a friend who does not enrich himself by means of it.\nWhen a man dies, only three deeds will survive him: continuing alms, profitable knowledge and a child praying for him.\nThe two oldest known waqfiya (deed) documents are from the 9th century, while a third one dates from the early 10th century, all three within the Abbasid Period. The oldest dated waqfiya goes back to 876 CE, concerns a multi-volume Qur'an edition and is held by the Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum in Istanbul. A possibly older waqfiya is a papyrus held by the Louvre Museum in Paris, with no written date but considered to be from the mid-9th century.\nThe earliest known waqf in Egypt, founded by financial official Ab\u016b Bakr Mu\u1e25ammad bin Ali al-Madhara'i in 919 (during the Abbasid period), is a pond called Birkat \u1e24abash together with its surrounding orchards, whose revenue was to be used to operate a hydraulic complex and feed the poor. In India, wakfs are relatively common among Muslim communities and are regulated by the Central Wakf Council and governed by Wakf Act 1995 (which superseded Wakf Act 1954).\n\n\n== Modern college and university endowments ==\n\nAcademic institutions, such as colleges and universities, will frequently control an endowment fund that finances a portion of the operating or capital requirements of the institution. In addition to a general endowment fund, each university may also control a number of restricted endowments that are intended to fund specific areas within the institution. The most common examples are endowed professorships (also known as named chairs), and endowed scholarships or fellowships.\nThe practice of endowing professorships began in the modern European university system in England in 1502, when Lady Margaret Beaufort, Countess of Richmond and grandmother to the future king Henry VIII, created the first endowed chairs in divinity at the universities of Oxford (Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity) and Cambridge (Lady Margaret's Professor of Divinity). Nearly 50 years later, Henry VIII established the Regius Professorships at both universities, this time in five subjects: divinity, civil law, Hebrew, Greek, and physic\u2014the last of those corresponding to what are now known as medicine and basic sciences. Today, the University of Glasgow has fifteen Regius Professorships.\nPrivate individuals also adopted the practice of endowing professorships. Isaac Newton held the Lucasian Chair of Mathematics at Cambridge beginning in 1669, more recently held by the celebrated physicist Stephen Hawking.In the United States, the endowment is often integral to the financial health of educational institutions. Alumni or friends of institutions sometimes contribute capital to the endowment. The use of endowment funding is strong in the United States and Canada but less commonly found outside of North America, with the exceptions of Cambridge and Oxford universities. Endowment funds have also been created to support secondary and elementary school districts in several states in the United States.\n\n\n=== Endowed professorships ===\nAn endowed professorship (or endowed chair) is a position permanently paid for with the revenue from an endowment fund specifically set up for that purpose. Typically, the position is designated to be in a certain department. The donor might be allowed to name the position. Endowed professorships aid the university by providing a faculty member who does not have to be paid entirely out of the operating budget, allowing the university to either reduce its student-to-faculty ratio, a statistic used for college rankings and other institutional evaluations, or direct money that would otherwise have been spent on salaries toward other university needs. In addition, holding such a professorship is considered to be an honour in the academic world, and the university can use them to reward its best faculty or to recruit top professors from other institutions.\n\n\n=== Endowed scholarships and fellowships ===\nAn endowed scholarship is tuition (and possibly other costs) assistance that is permanently paid for with the revenue of an endowment fund specifically set up for that purpose. It can be either merit-based or need-based (the latter is only awarded to those students for whom the college expense would cause their family financial hardship) depending on university policy or donor preferences. Some universities will facilitate donors' meeting the students they are helping. The amount that must be donated to start an endowed scholarship can vary greatly.\nFellowships are similar, although they are most commonly associated with graduate students. In addition to helping with tuition, they may also include a stipend. Fellowships with a stipend may encourage students to work on a doctorate. Frequently, teaching or working on research is a mandatory part of a fellowship.\n\n\n== Charitable foundations ==\n\nA foundation (also a charitable foundation) is a category of nonprofit organization or charitable trust that will typically provide funding and support for other charitable organizations through grants, but may engage directly in charitable activities. Foundations include public charitable foundations, such as community foundations, and private foundations which are typically endowed by an individual or family. The term foundation though may also be used by organizations not involved in public grant-making.\n\n\n== Fiduciary management ==\n\nA financial endowment is typically overseen by a board of trustees and managed by a trustee or team of professional managers. Typically, the financial operation of the endowment is designed to achieve the stated objectives of the endowment.\nIn the United States, typically 4\u20136% of the endowment's assets are spent every year to fund operations or capital spending.  Any excess earnings are typically reinvested to augment the endowment and to compensate for inflation and recessions in future years.  This spending figure represents the proportion that historically could be spent without diminishing the principal amount of the endowment fund.\n\n\n== Criticism and reforms ==\n\nAs expressed by Rodney Foxworth in Nonprofit Quarterly, there is an inherent structural tension for many endowments between the stated mission of the fund, the history and sources of the endowed capital, and the governance of the endowment. In Foxworth's words, \"philanthropy is used to address problems created by an economic system that engenders radical wealth inequality, thus making philanthropy necessary in the first place.\" In other words, endowments are using the same economic tools and power structures that cause social problems in an attempt to solve those very problems.\n\n\n=== Ethics and endowment repatriation ===\nCritics like Justice Funders\u2019 Dana Kawaoka-Chen call for \"redistributing all aspects of well-being, democratizing power, and shifting economic control to communities.\". Endowment repatriation refers to campaigns that acknowledge the history of human and natural resource exploitation that is inherent to many large private funds. Repatriation campaigns ask for private endowments to be returned to the control of the people and communities that have been most affected by labor and environmental exploitation and often offer ethical frameworks for discussing endowment governance and repatriation.\nMany might say that, by definition, philanthropy is about redistributing resources. Yet to truly embody this principle, philanthropy must move far beyond the 5% payout requirements for grants and distribute ALL of its power and resources. This includes spending down one\u2019s endowment, investing in local and regional economic initiatives that build community wealth rather than investing in Wall Street, giving up decision-making power for grants, and, ultimately, turning over assets to community control.\nAfter the Heron Foundation's internal audit of its investments in 2011 uncovered an investment in a private prison that was directly contrary to the foundation's mission, they developed and then began to advocate for a four-part ethical framework to endowment investments conceptualized as Human Capital, \nNatural Capital, Civic Capital, and Financial Capital.Another example is the Ford Foundation's co-founding of the independent Native Arts and Culture Foundation in 2007. The Ford Foundation provided a portion of the initial endowment after self-initiated research into the foundation's financial support of Native and Indigenous artists and communities.  This results of this research indicated \"the inadequacy of philanthropic support for Native arts and artists\", related feedback from an unnamed Native leader that \"[o]nce [big foundations] put the stuff in place for an Indian program, then it is not usually funded very well. It lasts as long as the program officer who\nhad an interest and then goes away\" and recommended that an independent endowment be established and that \"[n]ative leadership is crucial\".\n\n\n=== Divestment campaigns and impact investing ===\n\nAnother approach to reforming endowments is the use of divestment campaigns to encourage endowments to not hold unethical investments. One of the earliest modern divestment campaigns was Disinvestment from South Africa which was used to protest apartheid policies. By the end of apartheid, more than 150 universities divested of South African investments, although it is not clear to what extent this campaign was responsible for ending the policy.A proactive version of divestment campaigns is impact investing, or mission investing which refers to investments \"made into companies, organizations, and funds with the intention to generate a measurable, beneficial social or environmental impact alongside a financial return.\" Impact investments provide capital to address social and environmental issues.\n\n\n=== Donor intent ===\n\nThe case of Leona Helmsley is often used to illustrate the downsides of the legal concept of donor intent as applied to endowments. In the 2000s, Helmsley bequested a multi-billion dollar trust to \"the care and welfare of dogs\". This trust was estimated at the time to total 10 times more than the combined 2005 assets of all registered animal-related charities in the United States.\nIn 1914, Frederick Goff sought to eliminate the \"dead hand\" of organized philanthropy and so created the Cleveland Foundation: the first community foundation. He created a corporately structured foundation that could utilize community gifts in a responsive and need-appropriate manner. Scrutiny and control resided in the \"live hand\" of the public as opposed to the \"dead hand\" of the founders of private foundations.\n\n\n=== Higher education ===\nResearch published in the American Economic Review indicates that major academic endowments often act in times of economic downturn in a way opposite of the intention of the endowment. This behavior is referred to as endowment hoarding, reflecting the way that economic downturns often lead to endowments decreasing their payouts rather than increasing them to compensate for the downturn.Large U.S.-based college and university endowments, which had posted large, highly publicized gains in the 1990s and 2000s, faced significant losses of principal in the 2008 economic downturn. The Harvard University endowment, which held $37 billion in June 2008, was reduced to $26 billion by mid-2009.  Yale University, the pioneer of an approach that involved investing heavily in alternative investments such as real estate and private equity, reported an endowment of $16 billion as of September 2009, a 30% annualized loss that was more than predicted in December 2008.  At Stanford University, the endowment was reduced from $17 billion to $12 billion as of September 2009. Brown University's endowment fell 27 percent to $2.04 billion in the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2009.  George Washington University lost 18% in that same fiscal year, down to $1.08 billion.In Canada, after the financial crisis in 2008, University of Toronto reported a loss of 31% ($545 million) of its previous year-end value in 2009. The loss is attributed to over-investment in hedge funds.\n\n\n=== Endowment taxes ===\n\nGenerally, endowment taxes are the taxation of financial endowments that otherwise not taxed due to their charitable, educational, or religious mission. Endowment taxes are typically enacted in response to criticisms that endowments are not operating as nonprofit organizations or that they have served as tax shelters, or that they are depriving local governments of essential property and other taxes.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFoundation (nonprofit)\nLists of institutions of higher education by endowment size\nin Canada\nin South Africa\nin the UK\nin the United States\nList of wealthiest charitable foundations\nEndowment tax\nWaqf\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nNewfield, Christopher (2008).
