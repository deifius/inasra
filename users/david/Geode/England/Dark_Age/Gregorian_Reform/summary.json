"Should not be confused with the Gregorian calendar.The Gregorian Reforms were a series of reforms initiated by Pope Gregory VII and the circle he formed in the papal curia, c. 1050\u201380, which dealt with the moral integrity and independence of the clergy. The reforms are considered to be named after Pope Gregory VII (1073\u201385), though he personally denied it and claimed his reforms, like his regnal name, honoured Pope Gregory I."
