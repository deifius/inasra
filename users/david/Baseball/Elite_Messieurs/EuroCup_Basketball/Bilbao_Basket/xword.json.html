  "content": "EuroCup Basketball, commonly known as the EuroCup and currently called 7DAYS EuroCup for sponsorship reasons, is an annual professional basketball club competition that has been organized by Euroleague Basketball since 2002.\nFounded in 2002 under the name ULEB Cup, the competition has been known as the Eurocup since the 2008\u201309 season, following a change in format. The ULEB Cup and EuroCup Basketball are considered the same competition, with the change of name being simply a re-branding.\nThe winner of the EuroCup qualifies for the next season's EuroLeague. \nThe title has been won by 11 clubs, 3 of which have won the title more than once. The most successful club in the competition are Valencia Basket, with four titles, who are also current champions after defeating Alba Berlin in the 2019 Finals.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe competition was created in 2002, as the ULEB Cup, and has had several names:\n\n2002\u201303 to 2007\u201308 ULEB Cup\n2008\u201309 to 2015\u201316 Eurocup Basketball\n2016\u201317 to present EuroCup Basketball\n\n\n=== Sponsorship names ===\nOn 7 July 2016, Chipita and Euroleague Basketball announced a strategic agreement to sponsor the European competition across the globe. According to the agreement, starting with the 2016\u201317 season, the competition would be named 7DAYS EuroCup. This title partnership was set to run for three seasons.\n\n\n=== Logos ===\n\n\n== Qualification ==\nClubs qualify for the competition based on their performance in their domestic leagues competitions. For this purpose, the clubs from countries participating in the ABA League qualify for the competition based on their performance in the ABA League, and not their domestic leagues.\n\n\n== Format ==\nStarting with the 2016\u201317 season, the EuroCup's first phase is the Regular Season, in which 24 teams participate. The participants include 24 clubs automatically entered into the Regular Season. Each team plays two games (home-and-away) against every other team in its group. At the end of the Regular Season, the field is cut from 24 to 16. The next phase, known as the Top 16, then begins, featuring the 16 survivors of the Regular Season in four-team groups. As in the Regular Season, each Top 16 group is contest in a double round-robin format. The group winners and runners-up advance to the third phase, the Playoffs. Each playoff series is best-of-three, and the winners of each series advance to the next round persistently until the Finals. Home advantage in the series goes to the best placed team in the Top 16. The Finals features the two remaining series winners in a best-of-three series with home advantage in the series to the best placed team in the Top 16.\n\n\n=== Previous EuroCup formats ===\nHistorically, the competition began with a group phase in which the starting field was reduced to 16 teams. The survivors then advanced to a knockout phase. In the inaugural 2002\u201303 season, the knockout phase consisted entirely of two-legged ties. In the following 2003\u201304 season, the final became a one-off game, but all other knockout ties remained two-legged.\nIn the 2007\u201308 season, the initial phase, now called the Regular Season, was only used to reduce the field to 32 teams. The survivors were paired into two-legged knockout ties, with the winners advancing to another set of two-legged ties. The survivors then entered the first-ever Final Eight phase in the competition's history, consisting of one-off knockout games.\nThe following 2008\u201309 season, was the first in which preliminary rounds were conducted. That year saw two preliminary rounds held, the first involving 16 teams, and the second involving the eight winners, plus eight teams that had received byes into that round. The survivors of the second preliminary round joined 24 direct qualifiers in the Regular Season. This season also saw the introduction of the Last 16 group phase, and proved to be the last for the Final Eight.\nThe last stage of the EuroCup, the EuroCup Finals, was reduced from eight teams to four, starting with the 2009\u201310 season. This stage was directly analogous to the EuroLeague Final Four, and like that stage of the EuroLeague, consisted of one-off knockout semifinals, followed by a single-game final. Unlike the EuroLeague Final Four, in which the third-place game and final are held two days after the semifinals, the corresponding games of the EuroCup were held the day after the semifinals.\nIn the 2012\u201313 season, the final was decided by a single game format, after double-legged semifinals and quarterfinals. For the 2013\u201314 season, the competition increased from 32 to 48 teams in the Regular Season phase. Another innovation that started in the 2013\u201314 season, was that the clubs were divided into two regional conferences, the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference, for the Regular Season phase. The size of the groups grew to six teams, where the first three qualified teams joined the Last 32 stage. In addition, the eight EuroLeague clubs that did not qualify for the EuroLeague Top 16 phase, joined the remaining 24 EuroCup teams and the Finals were decided by a double-legged series.\nFor the 2014\u201315 season, the competition contained 36 teams at the group stage. There were 6 groups, each containing 6 teams. The 36 teams consisted of the 7 teams that were eliminated in the 2014\u201315 Euroleague season qualification rounds, and 29 teams that qualified directly to the 2014\u201315 EuroCup, either through 2013\u201314 season results, or through wild cards. The top four teams from each of the Regular Season groups with the eight EuroLeague clubs that did not qualify for the EuroLeague Top 16 phase qualified to join the Last 32 stage. For the 2015\u201316 season, the competition contained 36 clubs automatically entered into the Regular Season and the eight EuroLeague clubs that did not qualify for the EuroLeague Top 16 phase qualified to join the Last 32 stage.\n\n\n=== European professional basketball club rankings ===\n\n\n=== Arena standards ===\nEffective as of the 2012\u201313 season, all EuroCup clubs must host their home games in arenas that have a regular seating capacity of at least 2,500 (all seated), and an additional minimum capacity of 200 VIP seats available. By comparison, EuroLeague licensed clubs host their home games in arenas that seat at least 10,000 people, while EuroLeague associated clubs must have arenas that seat 5,000.\n\n\n== Results ==\n\n\n== Awards ==\n\nAfter a given EuroCup season, before the finals, annual EuroCup awards are handed out to players. These awards include:\n\nMost Valuable Player\nFinals MVP\nRising Star\nCoach of the Year\nAll-EuroCup Team\n\n\n== Performance by club ==\n\n\n== Performance by country ==\n\n\n== Statistical leaders and individual high performances ==\n\n\n=== All-time leaders ===\n\n\n=== Highest attendance records ===\n24,232 attendance for Red Star Belgrade in a 79\u201370 win over Budivelnyk Kyiv, at Kombank Arena, Belgrade, on 26 March 2014.\n22,736 attendance for Red Star Belgrade in a 63\u201352 win over UNICS Kazan, at Kombank Arena, Belgrade, on 2 April 2014.\n\n\n== Sponsors ==\nTitle sponsor7DAYSPremium partnersTurkish Airlines\nTempobet (only in Germany)\nFonbet (only in Russia)\nNesine (only in Turkey)\nbetfair (only in Spain)\nsportingbet (only in Greece)\nAdidasGlobal partnersSpalding\nOdeabank (only in Turkey)\nHead & Shoulders (only in Turkey)\nSEK (only in Turkey)\nOscar Mayer (only in Spain)\nEndesa (only in Spain)Source:\n\n\n== References and notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEuroCup official website\nAll-time statistics with links to all results",
