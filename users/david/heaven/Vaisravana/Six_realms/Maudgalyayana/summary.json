"Maudgaly\u0101yana (Pali: Moggall\u0101na), also known as Mah\u0101maudgaly\u0101yana or by his birth name Kolita, was one of the Buddha's closest disciples. Described as a contemporary of disciples such as Subhuti, \u015a\u0101riputra (Pali: S\u0101riputta), and Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa (Pali: Mah\u0101kassapa), he is considered the second of the Buddha's two foremost male disciples, together with \u015a\u0101riputra. Traditional accounts relate that Maudgaly\u0101yana and \u015a\u0101riputra become spiritual wanderers in their youth. After having searched for spiritual truth for a while, they come into contact with the Buddhist teaching through verses that have become widely known in the Buddhist world. Eventually they meet the Buddha himself and ordain as monks under him. Maudgaly\u0101yana attains enlightenment shortly after that.\nMaudgalyayana and \u015a\u0101riputra have a deep spiritual friendship. They are depicted in Buddhist art as the two disciples that accompany the Buddha, and they have complementing roles as teachers. As a teacher, Maudgalyayana is known for his psychic powers, and he is often depicted using these in his teaching methods. In many early Buddhist canons, Maudgaly\u0101yana is instrumental in re-uniting the monastic community after Devadatta causes a schism. Furthermore, Maudgaly\u0101yana is connected with accounts about the making of the first Buddha image. Maudgaly\u0101yana dies at the age of eighty-four, killed through the efforts of a rival sect. This violent death is described in Buddhist scriptures as a result of Maudgaly\u0101yana's karma of having killed his own parents in a previous life.\nThrough post-canonical texts, Maudgaly\u0101yana became known for his filial piety through a popular account of him transferring his merits to his mother. This led to a tradition in many Buddhist countries known as the ghost festival, during which people dedicate their merits to their ancestors. Maudgaly\u0101yana has also traditionally been associated with meditation and sometimes Abhidharma texts, as well as the Dharmaguptaka school. In the nineteenth century, relics were found attributed to him, which have been widely venerated."
