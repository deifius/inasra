"Vai\u015brava\u1e47a (Sanskrit) or Vessava\u1e47a (Pali; Tibetan: \u0f62\u0fa3\u0f58\u0f0b\u0f50\u0f7c\u0f66\u0f0b\u0f66\u0fb2\u0f66\u0f0b, Lhasa dialect: [Namt\u00f6s\u00e9], simplified Chinese: \u591a\u95fb\u5929\u738b; traditional Chinese: \u591a\u805e\u5929\u738b; pinyin: Du\u014dw\u00e9n Ti\u0101nw\u00e1ng, Japanese: \u6bd8\u6c99\u9580\u5929, romanized: Bishamonten Korean: \ube44\uc0ac\ubb38\ucc9c, romanized: Bisamuncheon), is one of the Four Heavenly Kings, and is considered an important figure in Buddhism.\n\n\n== Names ==\nThe name Vai\u015brava\u1e47a is a v\u1e5bddhi derivative (used, e.g., for patronymics) of the Sanskrit proper name Vi\u015brava\u1e47a from the root vi-\u015bru \"hear distinctly\", (passive) \"become famous\". The name Vai\u015brava\u1e47a is derived from the Sanskrit vi\u015brava\u1e47a which means \"son of Vishrava\", a usual epithet of the Hindu god Kubera. Vai\u015brava\u1e47a is also known as Kubera and Jambhala in Sanskrit and Kuvera in P\u0101li.Other names include:\n\ntraditional Chinese: \u591a\u805e\u5929; simplified Chinese: \u591a\u95fb\u5929; pinyin: Du\u014dw\u00e9n Ti\u0101n; Japanese: \u591a\u805e\u5929 (Tamonten); Korean: \ub2e4\ubb38\ucc9c (Damuncheon); Vietnamese: \u0110a V\u0103n Thi\u00ean, a calque of Sanskrit Vai\u015brava\u1e47a\ntraditional Chinese: \u6bd7\u6c99\u9580\u5929; simplified Chinese: \u6bd7\u6c99\u95e8\u5929; pinyin: P\u00edsh\u0101m\u00e9n Ti\u0101n; Japanese: \u6bd8\u6c99\u9580\u5929 (Bishamonten); Korean: \ube44\uc0ac\ubb38\ucc9c (Bisamuncheon); Vietnamese: T\u1ef3 Sa M\u00f4n Thi\u00ean.

Although brought into East Asia as a Buddhist deity, Vai\u015brava\u1e47a has become a character in folk religion and has acquired an identity that is partially independent of the Buddhist tradition (cf. the similar treatment of Guanyin and Yama).\nVai\u015brava\u1e47a is the guardian of the northern direction, and his home is in the northern quadrant of the topmost tier of the lower half of Sumeru. He is the leader of all the yak\u1e63as who dwell on the Sumeru's slopes.\nHe is often portrayed with a yellow face. He carries an umbrella or parasol (chatra) as a symbol of his sovereignty.  He is also sometimes displayed with a mongoose, often shown ejecting jewels from its mouth. The mongoose is the enemy of the snake, a symbol of greed or hatred; the ejection of jewels represents generosity.\n\n\n== In Therav\u0101da tradition ==\n\nIn the P\u0101li Canon of Therav\u0101da Buddhism, Vai\u015brava\u1e47a is called Vessava\u1e47a. Vessava\u1e47a is one of the C\u0101turmah\u0101r\u0101jika deva or \"Four Great Heavenly Kings\", each of whom rules over a specific direction. Vessava\u1e47a's realm is the northern quadrant of the world, including the land of Uttarakuru.  According to some suttas, he takes his name from a region there called Vis\u0101\u1e47a; he also has a city there called \u0100lakamand\u0101 which is a byword for wealth. Vessava\u1e47a governs the yakshas \u2013 beings with a nature between 'fairy' and 'ogre'.\nVessava\u1e47a's wife is named Bhu\u00f1jat\u012b, and he has five daughters, Lat\u0101, Sajj\u0101, Pavar\u0101, Acchimat\u012b, and Sut\u0101.  He has a nephew called Pu\u1e47\u1e47aka, a yakkha, husband of the n\u0101ga woman Irandat\u012b.  He has a chariot called N\u0101r\u012bv\u0101hana.  He is called gad\u0101vudha (Sanskrit: gad\u0101yudha) \"armed with a club\", but he only used it before he became a follower of the Buddha.\nVessava\u1e47a has the name \"Kuvera\" from a name he had from a past life as a rich Brahmin mill-owner from Sri Lanka, who gave all the produce of one of his seven mills to charity, and provided alms to the needy for 20,000 years. He was reborn in the C\u0101tummah\u0101r\u0101jik\u0101 heaven as a result of this good karma.\nAs with all the Buddhist deities, Vessava\u1e47a is properly the name of an office (filled for life) rather than a permanent individual.  Each Vessava\u1e47a is mortal, and when he dies, he will be replaced by a new Vessava\u1e47a.  Like other beings of the C\u0101tummah\u0101r\u0101jika world, his lifespan is 90,000 years (other sources say nine million years).  Vessava\u1e47a has the authority to grant the yakkhas particular areas (e.g., a lake) to protect, and these are usually assigned at the beginning of a Vessava\u1e47a's reign.\nWhen Gautama Buddha was born, Vessava\u1e47a became his follower, and eventually attained the stage of sot\u0101panna, one who has only seven more lives before enlightenment. He often brought the Buddha and his followers messages from the gods and other humans, and protected them.  He presented to the Buddha the \u0100\u1e6d\u0101n\u0101\u1e6d\u0101 verses, which Buddhists meditating in the forest could use to ward off the attacks of wild yakkhas or other supernatural beings who do not have faith in the Buddha.  These verses are an early form of paritta chanting.\nBimbis\u0101ra, King of Magadha, after his death was reborn as a yakkha called Janavasabha in the retinue of Vessava\u1e47a.\nIn the early years of Buddhism, Vessava\u1e47a was worshipped at trees dedicated to him as shrines.  Some people appealed to him to grant them children.\n\n\n== In Japan ==\n\nIn Japan, Bishamonten (\u6bd8\u6c99\u9580\u5929), or just Bishamon (\u6bd8\u6c99\u9580) is thought of as an armor-clad god of war or warriors and a punisher of evildoers.  Bishamon is portrayed holding a spear in one hand and a small pagoda in the other hand, the latter symbolizing the divine treasure house, whose contents he both guards and gives away.  In Japanese folklore, he is one of the Seven Lucky Gods.\nBishamon is also called Tamonten (\u591a\u805e\u5929 lit. \"listening to many teachings\") because he is seen as the guardian of the places where the Buddha preaches. He is believed to live halfway down Mount Sumeru.  He is also associated with Hachiman. Especially in the Shingon tradition that gives some place and worth to this hybrid character of Bishamon although most Mahayana temples have Bishamon and his counterpart as guardians at the entrance gate.\n\n\n== In Tibet ==\n\nIn Tibet, Vai\u015brava\u1e47a is considered a lokap\u0101la or dharmap\u0101la in the retinue of Ratnasambhava. He is also known as the King of the North.  As guardian of the north, he is often depicted on temple murals outside the main door.  He is also thought of as a god of wealth.  As such, Vai\u015brava\u1e47a is sometimes portrayed carrying a citron, the fruit of the jambhara tree, a pun on another name of his, Jambhala.  The fruit helps distinguish him iconically from depictions of Kuvera. He is sometimes represented as corpulent and covered with jewels. When shown seated, his right foot is generally pendant and supported by a lotus-flower on which is a conch shell. His mount is a snow lion. Tibetan Buddhists consider Jambhala's sentiment regarding wealth to be providing freedom by way of bestowing prosperity, so that one may focus on the path or spirituality rather than on the materiality and temporality of that wealth.\n\n\n== In Thailand ==\nIn Thailand, he resolves the dispute that arose in the legend of Nang Ai and Phadaeng.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nThe 2011 manga Noragami, which revolves around Japanese mythology, depicts this deity's Japanese iteration Bishamonten as a lady possessing similar traits and equipped with modern weapons.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBuddhism and violence\nFour Heavenly Kings\nIron Man, Tibetan sculpture of Vai\u015brava\u1e47a carved from a meteorite\nLi Jing\nPa\u00f1cika, commander-in-chief, or general, of Vai\u015brava\u1e47a's Yak\u1e63a army\nSeven Lucky Gods\nUesugi Kenshin\nVasudhara\n\n\n== References =="
