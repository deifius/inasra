"Alpha-catenin functions as the primary protein link between cadherins and the actin cytoskeleton. It has been reported that the actin binding proteins vinculin and alpha-actinin can bind to alpha-catenin. It has been suggested that alpha-catenin does not bind with high affinity to both actin filaments and the E-cadherin-beta-catenin complex at the same time. It has been observed that when alpha-catenin is not in a molecular complex with beta-catenin, it dimerizes and functions to regulate actin filament assembly, possibly by competing with Arp2/3 protein. Alpha catenin exhibits significant protein dynamics.The amino acid sequence of alpha-catenin has sequence similarity to that of vinculin.\n\n\n== Types ==\nThree alpha-catenin genes are expressed in humans:\nCTNNA1, alpha-1-catenin (also called alpha-E-catenin)\nCTNNA2, alpha-2-catenin (also called alpha-N-catenin)\nCTNNA3, alpha-3-catenin (also called alpha-T-catenin)\n\n\n== See also ==\nCatenin\n\n\n== External links ==\nalpha+Catenin at the US National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)\n\n\n== References =="
