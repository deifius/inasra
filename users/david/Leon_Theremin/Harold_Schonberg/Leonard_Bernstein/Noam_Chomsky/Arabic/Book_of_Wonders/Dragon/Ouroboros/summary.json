"The ouroboros or uroboros (, also UK: , US: ) is an ancient symbol depicting a serpent or dragon eating its own tail. Originating in ancient Egyptian iconography, the ouroboros entered Western tradition via Greek magical tradition and was adopted as a symbol in Gnosticism and Hermeticism and most notably in alchemy. The term derives from Ancient Greek  \u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03bf\u03b2\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, from \u03bf\u1f50\u03c1\u03ac oura 'tail' plus -\u03b2\u03bf\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 -boros '-eating'. The ouroboros is often interpreted as a symbol for eternal cyclic renewal or a cycle of life, death, and rebirth. The skin-sloughing process of snakes symbolizes the transmigration of souls, the snake biting its own tail is a fertility symbol in some religions, and the tail of the snake is a phallic symbol, the mouth is a yonic or womb-like symbol.\n\n"
