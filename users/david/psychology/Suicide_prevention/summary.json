"Suicide prevention is a collection of efforts to reduce the risk of suicide. These efforts may occur at the individual, relationship, community, and society level. Suicide is often preventable.Beyond direct interventions to stop an impending suicide, methods may include: \n\ntreating mental illness\nimproving coping strategies of people who are at risk\nreducing risk factors for suicide, such as poverty and social vulnerability\ngiving people hope for a better life after current problems are resolved\ncall a suicide hotline numberGeneral efforts include measures within the realms of medicine, mental health, and public health. Because protective factors such as social support and social engagement\u2014as well as environmental risk factors such as access to lethal means\u2014 play a role in suicide, suicide is not solely a medical or mental-health issue."
