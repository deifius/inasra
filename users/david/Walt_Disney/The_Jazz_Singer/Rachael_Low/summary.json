"Rachael Low (6 July 1923 \u2013 14 December 2014) was a British film historian, best known as the author of the seven-volume The History of the British Film.The daughter of the cartoonist Sir David Low, she gained her BSc in sociology and economics in 1944 from the London School of Economics, and her doctorate from the University of London in 1949. She published, in seven volumes between 1948 and 1985, The History of the British Film; this examines, in exacting detail, film production in Britain from its origins in 1896 until 1939. She was awarded a Research Fellowship by Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge, to facilitate her work on the later volumes of the series.Film critic Matthew Sweet has criticised Low's \"tyrannous influence\" on the writings of subsequent film historians.\n\n"
