"A television show \u2013 or simply TV show \u2013 is any content produced for viewing on a television set which can be broadcast via over-the-air, satellite, cable, - excluding breaking news, advertisements, or trailers that are typically placed between shows. Television shows are most often scheduled for broadcast well ahead of time and appear on electronic guides or other TV listings, but streaming services often make them available for viewing anytime. The content in a television show can be produced with different methodologies such as taped variety shows emanating from a television studio stage, animation or a variety of film productions ranging from movies to series. Shows not produced on a television studio stage are usually contracted or licensed to be made by appropriate production companies.\nTelevision shows can be viewed: live (real time); be recorded on home video; a digital video recorder for later viewing; be viewed on demand via a set-top box or streamed over the internet.\nA television show is also called a television program (British English: programme), especially if it lacks a narrative structure.\nIn the US and Canada, a television series is usually released in episodes that follow a narrative and are usually divided into seasons. In the UK, a television series, is a yearly or semiannual set of new episodes. (In effect, a \"series\" in the UK is the same as a \"season\" in the US and Canada.)\nWith approximately three to six episodes, a serials can be inside of or a small collection of episodes. A small collection may also be called a limited/ mini-series. A one-off collection of episodes may be called a \"'TV special\"' or limited series. A motion picture (also known as a movie) for television is initially broadcast as such rather than direct-to-video or the traditional big screen."
