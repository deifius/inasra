"Raymond Georges Yves Tanguy (January 5, 1900 \u2013 January 15, 1955), known as just Yves Tanguy (, French: [iv t\u0251\u0303\u0261i]), was a French surrealist painter.\n\n\n== Biography ==\nTanguy, the son of a retired navy captain, was born January 5, 1900, at the Ministry of Naval Affairs on Place de la Concorde in Paris, France. His parents were both of Breton origin. After his father's death in 1908, his mother moved back to her native Locronan, Finist\u00e8re, and he ended up spending much of his youth living with various relatives.\nIn 1918, Tanguy briefly joined the merchant navy before being drafted into the Army, where he befriended Jacques Pr\u00e9vert. At the end of his military service in 1922, he returned to Paris, where he worked various odd jobs. He stumbled upon a painting by Giorgio de Chirico and was so deeply impressed he resolved to become a painter himself in spite of his complete lack of formal training.Tanguy had a habit of being completely absorbed by the current painting he was working on. This way of creating artwork may have been due to his very small studio which only had enough room for one wet piece.Through his friend Pr\u00e9vert, in around 1924 Tanguy was introduced into the circle of surrealist artists around Andr\u00e9 Breton. Tanguy quickly began to develop his own unique painting style, giving his first solo exhibition in Paris in 1927, and marrying his first wife Jeannette Ducrocq (1896-1977) later that same year. During this busy time of his life, Breton gave Tanguy a contract to paint 12 pieces a year. With his fixed income, he painted less and ended up creating only eight works of art for Breton.\nIn December 1930, at an early screening of Bu\u00f1uel and Dali's L'Age d'Or, right-wing activists went to the lobby of the cinema where the film was being screened, and destroyed art works by Dal\u00ed, Joan Mir\u00f3, Man Ray, Tanguy, and others.\nThroughout the 1930s, Tanguy adopted the bohemian lifestyle of the struggling artist with gusto, leading eventually to the failure of his first marriage. He had an intense affair with Peggy Guggenheim in 1938 when he went to London with his wife Jeannette Ducrocq to hang his first retrospective exhibition in Britain at her gallery Guggenheim Jeune. The exhibition was a great success and Guggenheim wrote in her autobiography that \"Tanguy found himself rich for the first time in his life\". She purchased his pictures Toilette de L'Air and The Sun in Its Jewel Case (Le Soleil dans son \u00e9crin) for her collection. Tanguy also painted Peggy two beautiful earrings.  The affair continued in both London and Paris and only finished when Tanguy met a fellow Surrealist artist who would become his second wife.In 1938, after seeing the work of fellow artist Kay Sage, Tanguy began a relationship which led to his second marriage. With the outbreak of World War II, Sage moved back to her native New York, and Tanguy, judged unfit for military service, followed her. He would spend the rest of his life in the United States. Sage and Tanguy were married in Reno, Nevada on August 17, 1940. Their marriage proved durable but tense. Both drank heavily, and Tanguy assaulted Sage verbally and sometimes physically, pushing her and sometimes even threatening her with a knife privately and at social gatherings. Sage, according to friends' accounts, made no response to her husband's aggression. Toward the end of the war, the couple moved to Woodbury, Connecticut, converting an old farmhouse into an artists' studio. They spent the rest of their lives there. In 1948, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.In January 1955, Tanguy suffered a fatal stroke at Woodbury. His body was cremated and his ashes preserved until Sage's death in 1963. Later, his ashes were scattered by his friend Pierre Matisse on the beach at Douarnenez in his beloved Brittany, together with those of his wife.\n\n\n== Style and legacy ==\n\nTanguy's paintings have a unique, immediately recognizable style of nonrepresentational surrealism. They show vast, abstract landscapes, mostly in a tightly limited palette of colors, only occasionally showing flashes of contrasting color accents. Typically, these alien landscapes are populated with various abstract shapes, sometimes angular and sharp as shards of glass, sometimes with an intriguingly organic look to them, like giant amoebae suddenly turned to stone.According to Nathalia Brodska\u00efa, Mama, Papa is Wounded! (1927) is one of Tanguy's most impressive paintings. Brodska\u00efa writes that the painting reflects his debt to Giorgio de Chirico \u2013 falling shadows and a classical torso \u2013 and conjures up a sense of doom: the horizon, the emptiness of the plain, the solitary plant, the smoke, the helplessness of the small figures. Tanguy said that it was an image he saw entirely in his imagination before starting to paint it. He also claimed he took the title of this and other works from psychiatric textbooks: \"I remember spending a whole afternoon with ... Andr\u00e9 Breton,\" he said, \"leafing through books on psychiatry in the search for statements of patients which could be used as titles for paintings.\"  Jennifer Mundy, however, discovered that the title of this painting and several others were taken from a book about paranormal phenomena, Traite de metaphysique (1922) by Dr Charles Richet.Tanguy's style was an important influence on several younger painters, such as Roberto Matta, Wolfgang Paalen, and Esteban Franc\u00e9s, who adopted a Surrealist style in the 1930s. Later, Tanguy's paintings (and, less directly, those of de Chirico) influenced the style of the 1980 French animated movie Le Roi et l'oiseau, by Paul Grimault and Pr\u00e9vert.\n\n\n== Partial list of paintings ==\n\n\n=== 1920s ===\nVite!
