"The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) is an 8-bit third-generation home video game console produced by Nintendo. It was first released as the Family Computer (FC), commonly known as the Famicom, in 1983 in Japan. The NES, a redesigned version, made its debut in American test markets in October 1985, before becoming widely available in the rest of North America and other countries.\nAfter developing a series of successful arcade games in the early 1980s, Nintendo planned to create a home video game console. Rejecting proposals for a more complex console, president Hiroshi Yamauchi called for a simple, cheap design that ran games stored on cartridges. The controller design was reused from Nintendo's portable Game & Watch games. Several add-ons were released, such as a light gun for shooting games.\nThe NES featured a number of groundbreaking games, such as the platform game Super Mario Bros. and the action-adventure games The Legend of Zelda and Metroid, each of which became long-running Nintendo franchises. One of the bestselling consoles of its time, the NES helped revitalize the US video game industry following the video game crash of 1983. It introduced a now-standard business model of licensing third-party developers to produce and distribute games. The NES was succeeded in 1990 by the Super Nintendo Entertainment System."
