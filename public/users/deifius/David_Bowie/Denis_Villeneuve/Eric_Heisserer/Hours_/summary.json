"An hour (symbol: h; also abbreviated hr) is a unit of time conventionally reckoned as 1\u204424 of a day and scientifically reckoned as 3,599\u20133,601 seconds, depending on conditions. There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 24 hours in a day.\nThe hour was initially established in the ancient Near East as a variable measure of 1\u204412 of the night or daytime. Such seasonal, temporal, or unequal hours varied by season and latitude.\nEqual or equinoctial hours were taken as 1\u204424 of the day as measured from noon to noon; the minor seasonal variations of this unit were eventually smoothed by making it 1\u204424 of the mean solar day. Since this unit was not constant due to long term variations in the Earth's rotation, the hour was finally separated from the Earth's rotation and defined in terms of the atomic or physical second.\nIn the modern metric system, hours are an accepted unit of time defined as 3,600 atomic seconds. However, on rare occasions an hour may incorporate a positive or negative leap second, making it last 3,599 or 3,601 seconds, in order to keep it within 0.9 seconds of UT1, which is based on measurements of the mean solar day.\n\n"
