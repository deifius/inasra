"Homeric Greek is the form of the Greek language that was used by Homer in the Iliad and Odyssey and in the Homeric Hymns. It is a literary dialect of Ancient Greek consisting mainly of Ionic and Aeolic, with a few forms from Arcadocypriot, and a written form influenced by Attic. It was later named Epic Greek because it was used as the language of epic poetry, typically in dactylic hexameter, by poets such as Hesiod and Theognis of Megara. Compositions in Epic Greek may date from as late as the 3rd century BC, but it disappeared with the rise of Koine Greek.\n\n\n== Main features ==\nIn the following description, only forms that differ from those of later Greek are discussed. Omitted forms can usually be predicted from patterns seen in Ionic Greek.\n\n\n=== Phonology ===\nHomeric Greek is like Ionic Greek, and unlike Classical Attic, in shifting almost all cases of long \u1fb1 to \u03b7: thus, Homeric \u03a4\u03c1\u03bf\u03af\u03b7, \u1f65\u03c1\u03b7, \u03c0\u03cd\u03bb\u1fc3\u03c3\u03b9 for Attic \u03a4\u03c1\u03bf\u03af\u1fb1, \u1f65\u03c1\u1fb1, \u03c0\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03c2/\u03c0\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b9 \"Troy\", \"hour\", \"gates (dat.)\". Exceptions include nouns like \u03b8\u03b5\u1fb1\u0301 \"goddess\", and the genitive plural of first-declension nouns and the genitive singular of masculine first-declension nouns: \u03b8\u03b5\u1fb1\u0301\u03c9\u03bd, \u1f08\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u0390\u03b4\u1fb1\u03bf \"of goddesses, of the son of Atreus\".\n\n\n=== Nouns ===\nFirst declension\nThe nominative singular of most feminine nouns ends in -\u03b7, rather than long -\u1fb1, even after \u03c1, \u03b5, and \u03b9 (an Ionic feature): \u03c7\u03ce\u03c1\u03b7 for \u03c7\u03ce\u03c1\u1fb1. However, \u03b8\u03b5\u1fb1\u0301 and some names end in long -\u1fb1.\nSome masculine nouns have a nominative singular in short -\u1fb0 rather than -\u03b7\u03c2 (\u03bd\u03b1\u03cd\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, \u1f08\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u0390\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2): \u1f31\u03c0\u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u1fb0 for Attic \u1f31\u03c0\u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2.\nThe genitive singular of masculine nouns ends in -\u1fb1\u03bf or -\u03b5\u03c9, rather than -\u03bf\u03c5: \u1f08\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u0390\u03b4\u1fb1\u03bf for Attic \u1f08\u03c4\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5.\nThe genitive plural usually ends in -\u1fb1\u03c9\u03bd or -\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd: \u03bd\u03c5\u03bc\u03c6\u1fb1\u0301\u03c9\u03bd for Attic \u03bd\u03c5\u03bc\u03c6\u1ff6\u03bd.\nThe dative plural almost always end in -\u1fc3\u03c3\u03b9(\u03bd) or -\u1fc3\u03c2: \u03c0\u03cd\u03bb\u1fc3\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd for Attic \u03c0\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03c2.Second declension\nGenitive singular: ends in -\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf, as well as -\u03bf\u03c5. For example, \u03c0\u03b5\u03b4\u03af\u03bf\u03b9\u03bf, as well as \u03c0\u03b5\u03b4\u03af\u03bf\u03c5.\nGenitive and dative dual: ends in -\u03bf\u03b9\u03ca\u03bd. Thus, \u1f35\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03ca\u03bd appears, rather than \u1f35\u03c0\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd.\nDative plural: ends in -\u03bf\u03b9\u03c3\u03b9(\u03bd) and -\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2. For example, \u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03c3\u03b9, as well as \u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2.\nThird declension\nAccusative singular: ends in -\u03b9\u03bd, as well as -\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1. For example, \u03b3\u03bb\u03b1\u03c5\u03ba\u1ff6\u03c0\u03b9\u03bd, as well as \u03b3\u03bb\u03b1\u03c5\u03ba\u03ce\u03c0\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1.\nDative plural: ends in -\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b9 and -\u03c3\u03b9. For example, \u03c0\u03cc\u03b4\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b9 or \u1f14\u03c0\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b9.\nHomeric Greek lacks the quantitative metathesis present in later Greek (except in certain masculine \u03b1-stem genitive singulars):\nHomeric \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u1fc6\u03bf\u03c2 instead of \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03ad\u03c9\u03c2, \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7\u03bf\u03c2 instead of \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2\n\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u1fc6\u03b1 instead of \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03ad\u1fb1\n\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u1fc6\u03b1\u03c2 instead of \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03ad\u1fb1\u03c2\n\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03ae\u03c9\u03bd instead of \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd\nHomeric Greek sometimes uses different endings:\n\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7\u03bf\u03c2 alternates with \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2A note on nouns:\n\nAfter short vowels, the reflex of Proto-Greek *ts can alternate between -\u03c3- and -\u03c3\u03c3- in Homeric Greek. This can be of metrical use. For example, \u03c4\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03c4\u03cc\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 are equivalent; \u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2; \u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03af and \u03c0\u03bf\u03c3\u03c3\u03af.\nA relic of the Proto-Greek instrumental case, the ending -\u03c6\u03b9(\u03bd) (-\u03bf\u03c6\u03b9(\u03bd)) can be used for the dative singular and plural of nouns and adjectives (occasionally for the genitive singular and plural, as well). For example, \u03b2\u03af\u03b7\u03c6\u03b9 (...by force), \u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03c5\u03cc\u03c6\u03b9\u03bd (...with tears), and \u1f44\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03c6\u03b9\u03bd (...in the mountains).\n\n\n=== Pronouns ===\nThird-person singular pronoun (\"he, she, it\") (the relative) or rarely singular article (\"the\"): \u1f41, \u1f21, \u03c4\u03cc\nThird-person plural pronoun (\"they\") (the relative) or rarely plural article (\"the\"): nominative \u03bf\u1f30, \u03b1\u1f30, \u03c4\u03bf\u03af, \u03c4\u03b1\u03af, dative \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2, \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b9, \u03c4\u1fc7\u03c2, \u03c4\u1fc7\u03c3\u03b9, \u03c4\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c2.\n\n\n=== Verbs ===\nPerson endings\n-\u03bd appears rather than -\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd. For example, \u1f14\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd for \u1f14\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd in the third-person plural active.\nThe third plural middle/passive often ends in -\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 or -\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf; for example, \u1f25\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf is equivalent to \u1f27\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf.Tenses\nFuture: Generally remains uncontracted. For example, \u1f10\u03c1\u03ad\u03c9 appears instead of \u1f10\u03c1\u1ff6 or \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u03ad\u03c9 instead of \u03c4\u03b5\u03bb\u1ff6.\nPresent or imperfect: These tenses sometimes take iterative form with the letters -\u03c3\u03ba- penultimate with the ending. For example, \u03c6\u03cd\u03b3\u03b5\u03c3\u03ba\u03bf\u03bd: 'they kept on running away'\nAorist or imperfect: Both tenses can occasionally drop their augments. For example, \u03b2\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd may appear instead of \u1f14\u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd, and \u1f14\u03bc\u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5 may appear instead of \u1f10\u03bd\u03ad\u03b2\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5.\nHomeric Greek does not have a historical present tense, but rather uses injunctives. Injunctives are replaced by the historical present in the post-Homeric writings of Thucydides and Herodotus.\nSubjunctive\nThe subjunctive appears with a short vowel. Thus, the form \u1f34\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd, rather than \u1f34\u03c9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd.\nThe second singular middle subjunctive ending appears as both -\u03b7\u03b1\u03b9 and -\u03b5\u03b1\u03b9.\nThe third singular active subjunctive ends in -\u03c3\u03b9(\u03bd). Thus, we see the form \u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u1fc7\u03c3\u03b9, instead of \u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u1fc7.\nOccasionally, the subjunctive is used in place of the future and in general remarks.Infinitive\nThe infinitive appears with the endings -\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd, -\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9, and -\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9, in place of -\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd and -\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9. For example, \u03b4\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 for \u03b4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9; \u1f34\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd instead of \u1f30\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9; \u1f14\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd, \u1f14\u03bc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd, or \u1f14\u03bc\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 for \u03b5\u1f36\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9; and \u1f00\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03ad\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd(\u03b1\u03b9) in place of \u1f00\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd.Contracted verbs\nIn contracted verbs, where Attic employs an -\u03c9-, Homeric Greek will use -\u03bf\u03c9- or -\u03c9\u03c9- in place of -\u03b1\u03bf-. For example, Attic \u1f41\u03c1\u1ff6\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 becomes \u1f41\u03c1\u03cc\u03c9\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2.\nSimilarly, in places where -\u03b1\u03b5- contracts to -\u03b1- or -\u03b1\u03b5\u03b9- contracts to -\u1fb3-, Homeric Greek will show either \u03b1\u03b1 or \u03b1\u1fb3.\n\n\n=== Adverbs ===\nAdverbial suffixes\n-\u03b4\u03b5 conveys a sense of 'to where'; \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03b4\u03b5 'to the war'\n-\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd conveys a sense of 'how'; \u03ba\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b7\u03b4\u03cc\u03bd 'with cries'\n-\u03b8\u03b5\u03bd conveys a sense of 'from where'; \u1f51\u03c8\u03cc\u03b8\u03b5\u03bd 'from above'\n-\u03b8\u03b9 conveys a sense of 'where'; \u1f51\u03c8\u03cc\u03b8\u03b9 'on high'\n\n\n=== Particles ===\n\u1f04\u03c1\u03b1, \u1f04\u03c1, \u1fe5\u03b1  'so' or 'next' (transition)\n\u03c4\u03b5  'and' (a general remark or a connective)Emphatics\n\u03b4\u03ae 'indeed'\n\u1f26  'surely'\n\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1 'just' or 'even'\n\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 'I tell you ...' (assertion)\n\n\n=== Other features ===\nIn most circumstances, Homeric Greek did not have available a true definite article. \u1f49, \u1f21, \u03c4\u03cc and their inflected forms do occur, but they are in origin demonstrative pronouns.\n\n\n== Vocabulary ==\nHomer (in the Iliad and the Odyssey) uses about 9,000 words, of which 1,382 are proper names. Of the 7,618 remaining words 2,307 are hapax legomena.\n\n\n== Sample ==\nThe Iliad, lines 1\u20137\n\nRobert Fitzgerald (1974):\n\n\n== See also ==\nAncient Greek dialects\nHomeric texts\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nPharr, Clyde.
