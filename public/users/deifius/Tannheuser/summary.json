"Tannh\u00e4user (German: [\u02c8tanh\u0254\u028f\u032fz\u0250]; Middle High German: Tanh\u00fbser) was a German Minnesinger and poet. Historically, his biography is obscure beyond the poetry, which dates between 1245 and 1265.\nHis name becomes associated with a \"fairy queen\"-type folk ballad in German folklore of the 16th century."
