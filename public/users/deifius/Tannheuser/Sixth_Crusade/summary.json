"The Fifth Crusade (1217\u20131221) was a campaign by Western Europeans to reacquire Jerusalem and the rest of the Holy Land by first conquering Egypt, ruled by the powerful Ayyubid sultanate, led by Al-Adil, brother of Saladin.\nAfter the failure of the Fourth Crusade, Innocent III again called for a Crusade, and began organizing Crusading armies led by Andrew II of Hungary and Leopold VI of Austria. An initial attack in late 1217 in Syria was inconclusive.  Later in 1218, a German army led by cleric Oliver of Paderborn, and a mixed army of Dutch, Flemish and Frisian soldiers led by William I of Holland, joined the Crusade.\nFollowing the siege of Damietta in 1218\u20131219, the Crusaders occupied the port for two years. They then marched south towards Cairo in July 1221. On the way, they attacked the stronghold of Mansurah, but were forced to surrender. Al-Kamil, now sultan of Egypt, forced the Crusaders to retreat from Damietta\u2014leaving Egypt altogether\u2014and to agree to an eight-year peace agreement.\n\n"
