"Swiss citizenship is the status of being a citizen of Switzerland and it can be obtained by birth or naturalisation.\nThe Swiss Citizenship Law is based on the following principles:\n\nTriple citizenship level (Swiss Confederation, canton, and municipality)\nAcquisition of citizenship through descent (jus sanguinis)\nPrevention of statelessnessSwiss nationals are citizens of their municipality of origin, their canton of origin, and the Confederation, in that order: a Swiss citizen is defined as someone who has the bourgeoisie of a Swiss municipality (article 37 of the Swiss Federal Constitution). They are entered in the family register of their place of origin. The manner by which Swiss citizens acquire their place of origin differs depending on whether they acquired Swiss citizenship by filiation (jus sanguinis), ordinary naturalisation, or facilitated naturalisation. Marriage has in and of itself no effect on the places of origin of the spouses."
