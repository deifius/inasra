administrative groupings whose primary purposes were the organization of common defensive structure and the collection of imperial taxes. They were also used as a means of organization within the Imperial Diet and the Imperial Chamber Court. Each circle had a Circle Diet, although not every member of the Circle Diet would hold membership of the Imperial Diet as well.\nSix Imperial Circles were introduced at the Diet of Augsburg in 1500. In 1512, three more circles were added, and the large Saxon Circle was split into two, so that from 1512 until the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire in the Napoleonic era, there were ten Imperial Circles. The Crown of Bohemia, the Swiss Confederacy and Italy remained unencircled, as did various minor territories which held imperial immediacy.\n\n\n== Formation ==\nInitially the 1500 Diet of Augsburg set up six Imperial Circles as part of the Imperial Reform:\n\nthe Bavarian Circle\nthe Franconian Circle\nthe Saxon Circle\nthe Swabian Circle\nthe Upper Rhenish Circle\nthe (Lower Rhenish-)Westphalian CircleOriginally, the territories held by the Habsburg dynasty and the Electors remained unencircled. In 1512 the Diet at Trier and Cologne organized these lands into three more circles:\n\nthe Austrian Circle, including the Habsburg territories inherited by Maximilian I\nthe Burgundian Circle, including the patrimony of Maximilian's late wife, Mary of Burgundy\nthe Electoral Rhenish Circle, including the ecclesiastical Electorates of Mainz, Cologne and Trier, and the secular Electorate of the Palatinate.Also, the Saxon circle got divided into:\n\nthe Lower Saxon Circle\nthe Upper Saxon Circle, including the Electorates of Saxony and BrandenburgThough the Empire lost several western territories after the secession of the Seven United Netherlands in 1581 and during the French annexations of the 1679 Peace of Nijmegen, the ten circles remained largely unchanged until the early 1790s, when the French Revolutionary Wars brought about significant changes to the political map of Europe.\nSome of the circles were de facto controlled by a powerful noble house. The Austrian Circle corresponded almost exactly with the Habsburg hereditary lands. The Burgundian Circle encompassed the territory controlled by the Spanish Habsburgs (Franche-Comte and the Habsburg Netherlands). The Bavarian Circle mostly consisted of the Wittelsbach Duchy of Bavaria plus its satellites. The Upper Saxon Circle was dominated by the electorates of Saxony (plus its satellite Ernestine duchies) and Brandenburg.\n\n\n== Unencircled territories ==\n\nA number of imperial territories remained unencircled, notably the lands of the Bohemian crown, the Old Swiss Confederacy and most of the Italian territories.\nBesides these, there were also a considerable number of minor territories which retained imperial immediacy, such as individual Imperial Villages, and the lands held by individual Imperial Knights.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nWinfried Dotzauer: Die deutschen Reichskreise in der Verfassung des alten Reiches und ihr Eigenleben. 1500\u20131806.

Electoral Palatinate (German: Kurpfalz) or the Palatinate (Pfalz), officially the Electorate of the Palatinate (Kurf\u00fcrstentum Pfalz), was a country that was part of the Holy Roman Empire. Counts palatine of the Rhine served as prince-electors (Kurf\u00fcrsten) from \"time immemorial,\" were noted as such in a papal letter of 1261, and were confirmed as electors by the Golden Bull of 1356.\nIt stretched from the left bank of the Upper Rhine, from the Hunsr\u00fcck mountain range in what is today the Palatinate region in the German federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate and the adjacent parts of the French regions of Alsace and Lorraine (bailiwick of Seltz from 1418 to 1766) to the opposite territory on the east bank of the Rhine in present-day Hesse and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg up to the Odenwald range and the southern Kraichgau region, containing the capital cities of Heidelberg and Mannheim.\nThe counts palatine of the Rhine held the office of imperial vicars in the territories under Frankish law (in Franconia, Swabia and the Rhineland) and ranked among the most significant secular Princes of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1541 elector Otto Henry converted to Lutheranism. Their climax and decline is marked by the rule of Elector Palatine Frederick V, whose coronation as king of Bohemia in 1619 sparked the Thirty Years' War. After the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, the ravaged lands were further afflicted by the \"Reunion\" campaigns launched by King Louis XIV of France, culminating in the Nine Years' War (1688\u201397). Ruled in personal union with the Electorate of Bavaria from 1777, the Palatinate was finally disestablished with the German mediatization and annexation by Baden on 27 April 1803.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\n\nThe comital office of Count Palatine at the Frankish court of King Childebert I was already mentioned about 535. The Counts Palatine were the permanent representatives of the King, in particular geographic areas, in contrast to the semi-independent authority of the dukes (and their successors). Under the Merovingian dynasty, the position had been a purely appointed one, but by the Middle Ages had evolved into an hereditary one.\nUp to the 10th century, the Frankish empire was centered at the royal palace (Pfalz) in Aachen, in what had become the Carolingian kingdom of Lotharingia. Consequently, the Count Palatine of Lotharingia became the most important of the Counts Palatine. Marital alliances meant that, by the Middle Ages, most Count Palatine positions had been inherited by the duke of the associated province, but the importance of the Count Palatine of Lotharingia enabled it to remain an independent position.\nIn 985, Herman I, a scion of the Ezzonids, is mentioned as count palatine of Lotharingia (which by then had been divided into Upper and Lower Lorraine). While his Palatine authority operated over the whole of Upper Lorraine, the feudal territories of his family were instead scattered around south western Franconia, including parts of the Rhineland around Cologne and Bonn, and areas around the Moselle, and the Nahe Rivers.\nIn continual conflicts with the rivalling Archbishops of Cologne, he changed the emphasis of his rule to the southern Eifel region and further to the Upper Rhine, where the Ezzonian dynasty governed several counties on both banks of the river. The southernmost point was near Alzey.\n\nFrom about 1085/86, after the death of the last Ezzonian count palatine Herman II, Palatinate authority ceased to have any military significance in Lotharingia. In practice, the Count Palatinate's Palatine authority had collapsed, reducing his successor (Henry of Laach) to a mere feudal magnate over his own territories \u2013 along the Upper Rhine in south-western Franconia. From this time on, his territory became known as the County Palatine of the Rhine (not because Palatine authority existed there, but as an acknowledgement that the Count still held the title, if not the authority, of Count Palatine).\nVarious noble dynasties competed to be enfeoffed with the Palatinate by the Holy Roman Emperor \u2013 among them the House of Ascania, the House of Salm (Count Otto I of Salm in 1040) and the House of Babenberg (Henry Jasomirgott in 1140/41).\nThe first hereditary Count Palatine of the Rhine was Conrad, a member of the House of Hohenstaufen and younger half-brother of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. The territories attached to this hereditary office in 1156 started from those held by the Hohenstaufens in the Donnersberg, Nahegau, Haardt, Bergstra\u00dfe and Kraichgau regions (other branches of the Hohenstaufens received lands in the Duchy of Swabia, Franche-Comt\u00e9, and so forth). Much of this was from their imperial ancestors, the Salian emperors, and apart from Conrad's maternal ancestry, the Counts of Saarbr\u00fccken. These backgrounds explain the composition of Upper and Rhenish Palatinate in the inheritance centuries onwards. About 1182, Conrad moved his residence from Stahleck Castle near Bacharach up the Rhine River to Heidelberg.\n\nUpon Conrad's death in 1195, the Palatinate passed to the House of Welf through the\u2014secret\u2014marriage of his daughter Agnes with Henry of Brunswick. When Henry's son Henry the Younger died without heirs in 1214, the Hohenstaufen king Frederick II enfeoffed the Wittelsbach duke Louis I of Bavaria. The Bavarian House of Wittelsbach eventually held the Palatinate territories until 1918.\nDuring a later division of territory among the heirs of Duke Louis II, Duke of Upper Bavaria, in 1294, the elder branch of the Wittelsbachs came into possession of both the Rhenish Palatinate and the territories in the Bavarian Nordgau (Bavaria north of the Danube river) with the centre around the town of Amberg. As this region was politically connected to the Rhenish Palatinate, the name Upper Palatinate (German: Oberpfalz) became common from the early 16th century in contrast to the Lower Palatinate along the Rhine.\nWith the Treaty of Pavia in 1329, the Wittelsbach emperor Louis IV, a son of Louis II, returned the Palatinate to his nephews Rudolf and Rupert.\n\n\n==== Foundation ====\n\nIn the Golden Bull of 1356, the Palatinate was recognized as one of the secular electorates, and given the hereditary offices of archsteward (German: Erztruchse\u00df, Latin: Archidapifer) of the Empire and imperial vicar (Reichsverweser) of Franconia, Swabia, the Rhine, and southern Germany. From that time forth, the Count Palatine of the Rhine was usually known as the Elector Palatine (German: Kurf\u00fcrst von der Pfalz, Latin: Palatinus elector).\nDue to the practice of dividing territories among different branches of the family, by the early 16th century junior lines of the Palatine Wittelsbachs came to rule in Simmern, Kaiserslautern, and Zweibr\u00fccken in the Lower Palatinate, and in Neuburg and Sulzbach in the Upper Palatinate.  The Elector Palatine, now based in Heidelberg, adopted Lutheranism in the 1530s; when the senior branch of the family died out in 1559, the Electorate passed to Frederick III of Simmern, a staunch Calvinist, and the Palatinate became one of the major centers of Calvinism in Europe, supporting Calvinist rebellions in both the Netherlands and France.\n\n\n=== Thirty Years' War ===\n\nIn 1619, the Protestant Frederick V, Elector Palatine accepted the throne of Bohemia from the Bohemian estates. This initiated the 1618\u20131648 Thirty Years' War, one of the most destructive conflicts in human history; it caused over eight million fatalities from military action, violence, famine and plague, the vast majority in the German states of the Holy Roman Empire. In terms of proportional German casualties and destruction, it was surpassed only by the period January to May 1945 and remains the single greatest war trauma in German memory.Frederick was evicted from Bohemia in 1620 following his defeat by the forces of Emperor Ferdinand II at the Battle of the White Mountain. Over the period 1621\u20131622, the Palatinate was occupied by Spanish and Bavarian troops and Frederick was exiled to the Dutch Republic. His territories and electoral rights were transferred to the distantly related but Catholic Maximilian I of Bavaria, who now became Elector of Bavaria.\nAfter his death in 1632, Frederick's daughter Princess Elizabeth and wife Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia, worked tirelessly to have the Palatinate restored to her son Charles Louis and the Protestant cause. When the Peace of Westphalia ended the war in 1648, he regained the Lower Palatinate and the title 'Elector Palatine' but now ranked lower in precedence than the others. He was succeeded by Charles II, Elector Palatine in 1680 but the Simmern family became extinct in the male line after he died in 1685.\nIn 1670, Charles II's cousin Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate married Philippe of Orl\u00e9ans, younger brother of Louis XIV; on this basis, Louis claimed half of the Palatinate for France. The direct heir to the Palatinate was Philip William, Catholic Count Palatine of Neuburg, Duke of J\u00fclich and Berg. His eldest daughter Eleonore married Emperor Leopold, while another, Maria Anna, married Charles II of Spain in 1690.\n\n\n=== Nine Years' War ===\nWhen France invaded the Palatinate in September 1688 to enforce their claim, these wider connections meant the conflict rapidly escalated and contributed to the outbreak of the 1689\u20131697 Nine Years' War. The French were forced to withdraw in 1689 but before doing so, they destroyed much of Heidelberg, another 20 substantial towns and numerous villages. This destruction was systematically applied across a large section of the Rhineland but especially the Palatinate, which was raided again in 1693; the devastation shocked much of Europe. France later renounced its claim in the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick. \n\nJohann Wilhelm succeeded as Elector in 1690, changing his residence first to D\u00fcsseldorf, then back to Heidelberg and finally Mannheim in 1720. Like his father, he was a Catholic, which under the 1555 Peace of Augsburg meant the Protestant majority in the Palatine should convert to Catholicism. The 1705 'Palatine Church Division' compromised by allocating 5/7ths of public church property to the Reformed or Calvinist church and 2/7ths to the Catholic, but excluded the Lutheran Church, whose membership exceeded 40% of the population in some areas.In 1716, Charles Philip succeeded his brother as Elector and in January 1742, helped his cousin Charles Albert become the first non-Habsburg Emperor in over 300 years. He died in December and the Palatinate passed to Charles Theodore, then Duke of Sulzbach, who also inherited the Electorate of Bavaria in 1777. The title and authority of the two Electorates were combined, Charles and his heirs retaining only the vote and precedence of the Bavarian elector, although continuing to use the title 'Count Palatine of the Rhine'.\n\n\n=== Mediatisation ===\n\nThe Palatine territories on the left bank of the Rhine were annexed by France in 1795, mainly becoming part of the Mont-Tonnerre department. The loss of these territories was accepted by Elector Maximilian I Joseph in the Treaty of Paris.  Those on the right were taken by the Elector of Baden, after the 1805 Peace of Pressburg dissolved the Holy Roman Empire; the remaining Wittelsbach territories were united by Maximilian Joseph as the Kingdom of Bavaria.\n\n\n== Coat of arms ==\n\nIn 1156 Conrad of Hohenstaufen, brother of emperor Frederick Barbarossa became Count Palatine. The old coat of arms of the House of Hohenstaufen, the single lion, became coat of arms of the palatinate.By marriage, the Palatinate's arms also became quartered with those of Welf and later Wittelsbach. \nThe arms of Bavaria were used with reference to the elector's holdings in Bavaria. This was extended to quartering of the lion and the Bavarian Arms upon the ascension of Maximilian I to the position of elector of the Palatinate in 1623, used concurrently with the arms shown. From 1356 onwards, the orb represented their position as Arch-Steward of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nIn 1806, Baden was raised to a grand duchy and parts of the former Palatinate including Mannheim became part of it. At the Congress of Vienna in 1814 and 1815, southern parts of the left-bank Palatinate were restored and enlarged by mediatisation (consuming the former Bishopric of Speyer, the Free Imperial City of Speyer, and others) up to the new border with France, and given (temporarily) to the Habsburg Austrian Empire; after this time, it was this new region that was principally known as \"the Palatinate\". The right-bank Palatinate remained with Baden while northern parts became part of Prussia (Rhine Province) and Hesse (Rhenish Hesse).\nIn 1816, the Palatinate became a formal part of the Wittelsbach Kingdom of Bavaria (the Rheinkreis or Circle of the Rhine) in a pre-arranged exchange for Tirol, which Bavaria ceded to Austria. Most of the area remained a part of Bavaria until after the Second World War (after 1918 the Free State of Bavaria), with some western parts becoming part of the Territory of the Saar Basin after World War I.\nIn September 1946 the territory was made part of the federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate, along with former left bank territories of Prussia (southern part of the Rhine Province, including the former Principality of Birkenfeld which had been an exclave of Oldenburg until 1937, and western parts of the Province of Nassau) and Rhenish Hesse. The former Territory of the Saar Basin was reinstated and expanded to create the French Saar Protectorate, which returned to Germany in 1956 as the modern state of Saarland.\n\n\n== See also ==\nGerman Palatines\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSophia of Hanover (2013).

helvetica \"Confederation of the Swiss\") was a loose confederation of independent small states (cantons, German Orte or St\u00e4nde) initially within the Holy Roman Empire. It is the precursor of the modern state of Switzerland.\nIt formed during the 14th century, from a nucleus in what is now Central Switzerland,  expanding to include the cities of Z\u00fcrich and Berne by the middle of the century. This formed a rare union of rural and urban communes, all of which enjoyed imperial immediacy in the Holy Roman Empire.\nThis confederation of eight cantons (Acht Orte) was politically and militarily successful for more than a century, culminating in the Burgundy Wars of the 1470s which established it as a power in the complicated political landscape dominated by France and the Habsburgs. Its success resulted in the addition of more confederates, increasing the number of cantons to thirteen (Dreizehn Orte) by 1513. The confederacy pledged neutrality in 1647 (under the threat of the Thirty Years' War), although many Swiss served privately as mercenaries in the Italian Wars and during the Early Modern period.\nAfter the Swabian War of 1499 the confederacy was a de facto independent state throughout the early modern period, although still nominally part of the Holy Roman Empire until 1648 when the Treaty of Westphalia ended the Thirty Years' War. The Swiss Reformation divided the confederates into Reformed and Catholic parties, resulting in internal conflict from the 16th to the 18th centuries; as a result, the federal diet (Tagsatzung) was often paralysed by hostility between the factions. The Swiss Confederacy fell to invasion by the French Revolutionary Army in 1798, after which it became the short-lived Helvetic Republic.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe adjective \"old\" was introduced after the Napoleonic era with Ancien R\u00e9gime, retronyms distinguishing the pre-Napoleonic from the restored confederation. During its existence the confederacy was known as Eidgenossenschaft or Eydtgnoschafft (\"oath fellowship\"), in reference to treaties among cantons; this term was first used in the 1370 Pfaffenbrief. Territories of the confederacy came to be known collectively as Schweiz or Schweizerland (Schwytzerland in contemporary spelling), with the English Switzerland beginning during the mid-16th century. From that time the Confederacy was seen as a single state, also known as the Swiss Republic (Republic der Schweitzer, R\u00e9publique des Suisses and Republica Helvetiorum by Josias Simmler in 1576) after the fashion of calling individual urban cantons republics (such as the Republics of Z\u00fcrich, Berne and Basel).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\n\nThe nucleus of the Old Swiss Confederacy was an alliance among the valley communities of the central Alps to facilitate management of common interests (such as trade) and ensure peace along trade routes through the mountains. The foundation of the Confederacy is marked by the R\u00fctlischwur (dated to 1307 by Aegidius Tschudi) or the 1315 Pact of Brunnen.\nSince 1889, the Federal Charter of 1291 among the rural communes of Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden has been considered the founding document of the confederacy.\n\n\n=== Expansion ===\n\nThe initial pact was augmented by pacts with the cities of Lucerne, Z\u00fcrich, and Berne. This union of rural and urban communes, which enjoyed the status of imperial immediacy within the Holy Roman Empire, was engendered by pressure from Habsburg dukes and kings who had ruled much of the land. In several battles with Habsburg armies, the Swiss were victorious; they conquered the rural areas of Glarus and Zug, which became members of the confederacy.From 1353 to 1481, the federation of eight cantons\u2014known in German as the Acht Orte (Eight Cantons)\u2014consolidated its position. The members (especially the cities) enlarged their territory at the expense of local counts\u2014primarily by buying judicial rights, but sometimes by force. The Eidgenossenschaft, as a whole, expanded through military conquest: the Aargau was conquered in 1415 and the Thurgau in 1460. In both cases, the Swiss profited from weakness in the Habsburg dukes. In the south, Uri led a military territorial expansion that (after many setbacks) would by 1515 lead to the conquest of the Ticino.\nNone of these territories became members of the confederacy; they had the status of condominiums (regions administered by several cantons).\nAt this time, the eight cantons gradually increased their influence on neighbouring cities and regions through additional alliances. Individual cantons concluded pacts with Fribourg, Appenzell, Schaffhausen, the abbot and the city of St. Gallen, Biel, Rottweil, Mulhouse and others. These allies (known as the Zugewandte Orte) became closely associated with the confederacy, but were not accepted as full members.\nThe Burgundy Wars prompted a further enlargement of the confederacy; Fribourg and Solothurn were accepted in 1481. In the Swabian War against Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, the Swiss were victorious and exempted from imperial legislation. The associated cities of Basel and Schaffhausen joined the confederacy as a result of that conflict, and Appenzell followed suit in 1513 as the thirteenth member. The federation of thirteen cantons (Dreizehn Orte) constituted the Old Swiss Confederacy until its demise in 1798.\nThe expansion of the confederacy was stopped by the Swiss defeat in the 1515 Battle of Marignano. Only Berne and Fribourg were still able to conquer the Vaud in 1536; the latter primarily became part of the canton of Berne, with a small portion under the jurisdiction of Fribourg.\n\n\n=== Reformation ===\n\nThe Reformation in Switzerland led to doctrinal division amongst the cantons. Z\u00fcrich, Berne, Basel, Schaffhausen and associates Biel, Mulhouse, Neuch\u00e2tel, Geneva and the city of St. Gallen became Protestant; other members of the confederation and the Valais remained Catholic. In Glarus, Appenzell, in the Grisons and in most condominiums both religions coexisted; Appenzell split in 1597 into a Catholic Appenzell Inner Rhodes and a Protestant Appenzell Outer Rhodes.\nThe division led to civil war (the Wars of Kappel) and separate alliances with foreign powers by the Catholic and Protestant factions, but the confederacy as a whole continued to exist. A common foreign policy was blocked, however, by the impasse. During the Thirty Years' War, religious disagreements among the cantons kept the confederacy neutral and spared it from belligerents. At the Peace of Westphalia, the Swiss delegation was granted formal recognition of the confederacy as a state independent of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n\n=== Early modern period ===\n\nGrowing social differences and an increasing absolutism in the city cantons during the Ancien R\u00e9gime led to local popular revolts. An uprising during the post-war depression after the Thirty Years' War escalated to the Swiss peasant war of 1653 in Lucerne, Berne, Basel, Solothurn and the Aargau. The revolt was put down swiftly by force and with the help of many cantons.\nReligious differences were accentuated by a growing economic discrepancy. The Catholic, predominantly rural central-Swiss cantons were surrounded by Protestant cantons with increasingly commercial economies. The politically dominant cantons were Z\u00fcrich and Berne (both Protestant), but the Catholic cantons were influential since the Second War of Kappel in 1531. A 1655 attempt (led by Z\u00fcrich) to restructure the federation was blocked by Catholic opposition, which led to the first battle of Villmergen in 1656; the Catholic party won, cementing the status quo. The problems remained unsolved, erupting again in 1712 with the second battle of Villmergen. This time the Protestant cantons won, dominating the confederation. True reform, however, was impossible; the individual interests of the thirteen members were too diverse, and the absolutist cantonal governments resisted all attempts at confederation-wide administration. Foreign policy remained fragmented.\n\n\n=== Collapse ===\n\nAttempting to gain control of key Alpine passes and establish a buffer against hostile monarchies, France first invaded associates of the Swiss Confederation; part of the bishopric of Basel was absorbed by France in 1793. In 1797, Napoleon annexed the Valtellina (on the border with Graub\u00fcnden) into the new Cisalpine Republic in northern Italy and invaded the southern remainder of the bishopric of Basel.In 1798 the confederacy was invaded by the French Revolutionary Army at the invitation of the Republican faction in Vaud, led by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric-C\u00e9sar de La Harpe. Vaud was under Bernese control, but chafed under a government with a different language and culture. The ideals of the French Revolution found a receptive audience in Vaud, and when Vaud declared itself a republic the French had a pretext to invade the confederation.\nThe invasion was largely peaceful (since the Swiss people failed to respond to political calls to take up arms), and the collapse of the confederacy was due more to internal strife than external pressure. Only Bern put up an effective resistance, but after its defeat in the March Battle of Grauholz it capitulated. The canton of Bern was divided into the canton of Oberland (with Thun as its capital) and the canton of L\u00e9man (with Lausanne as its capital).\nThe Helvetic Republic was proclaimed on 12 April 1798 as \"one and indivisible\", abolishing cantonal sovereignty and feudal rights and reducing the cantons to administrative districts. This system was unstable due to widespread opposition, and the Helvetic Republic collapsed as a result of the Stecklikrieg. A federalist compromise solution was attempted, but conflict between the federalist elite and republican subjects persisted until the formation of the federal state in 1848.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe (Alte) Eidgenossenschaft was initially united not by a single pact, but by overlapping pacts and bilateral treaties between members. The parties generally agreed to preserve the peace, aid in military endeavours and arbitrate disputes. Slowly, the members began to see the confederation as a unifying entity. In the Pfaffenbrief, a treaty of 1370 among six of the eight members (Glarus and Berne did not participate) forbidding feuds and denying clerical courts jurisdiction over the confederacy, the cantons for the first time used the term Eidgenossenschaft. The first treaty uniting the eight members of the confederacy was the Sempacherbrief of 1393, concluded after victories over the Habsburgs at Sempach in 1386 and N\u00e4fels in 1388, which forbade a member from unilaterally beginning a war without the consent of the other cantons. A federal diet, the Tagsatzung, developed during the 15th century.\nPacts and renewals (or modernizations) of earlier alliances reinforced the confederacy. The individual interests of the cantons clashed in the Old Z\u00fcrich War (1436\u20131450), caused by territorial conflict among Z\u00fcrich and the central Swiss cantons over the succession of the Count of Toggenburg. Although Z\u00fcrich entered an alliance with the Habsburg dukes, it then rejoined the confederacy. The confederation had become so close a political alliance that it no longer tolerated separatist tendencies in its members.\n\nThe Tagsatzung was the confederation council, typically meeting several times a year. Each canton delegated two representatives (including the associate states, which had no vote). The canton where the delegates met initially chaired the gathering, but during the 16th century Z\u00fcrich permanently assumed the chair (Vorort) and Baden became the seat. The Tagsatzung dealt with inter-cantonal affairs and was the court of last resort in disputes between member states, imposing sanctions on dissenting members. It also administered the condominiums; the reeves were delegated for two years, each time by a different canton.A unifying treaty of the Old Swiss Confederacy was the Stanser Verkommnis of 1481. Conflicts between rural and urban cantons and disagreements over the bounty of the Burgundian Wars had led to skirmishes. The city-states of Fribourg and Solothurn wanted to join the confederacy, but were distrusted by the central Swiss rural cantons. The compromise by the Tagsatzung in the Stanser Verkommnis restored order and assuaged the rural cantons' complaints, with Fribourg and Solothurn accepted into the confederation. While the treaty restricted freedom of assembly (many skirmishes arose from unauthorised expeditions by soldiers from the Burgundian Wars), it reinforced agreements amongst the cantons in the earlier Sempacherbrief and Pfaffenbrief.\nThe civil war during the Reformation ended in a stalemate. The Catholic cantons could block council decisions but, due to geographic and economic factors, could not prevail over the Protestant cantons. Both factions began to hold separate councils, still meeting at a common Tagsatzung (although the common council was deadlocked by disagreements between both factions until 1712, when the Protestant cantons gained power after their victory in the second war of Villmergen). The Catholic cantons were excluded from administering the condominiums in the Aargau, the Thurgau and the Rhine valley; in their place, Berne became co-sovereign of these regions.\n\n\n== List of territories ==\n\n\n=== Cantons ===\n\nThe confederation expanded in several stages: first to the Eight Cantons (Acht Orte), then in 1481 to ten, in 1501 to twelve, and finally to thirteen cantons (Dreizehn Orte).\nFounding cantons (Urkantone):\n Uri, founding canton named in the Federal Charter of 1291\n Schwyz, founding canton named in the Federal Charter of 1291\n Unterwalden, founding canton  named in the Federal Charter of 1291\n14th century: expansion to the Acht\u00f6rtige Eidgenossenschaft following the battles of Morgarten and Laupen:\n Lucerne, city canton, since 1332\n Z\u00fcrich, city canton, since 1351\n Glarus, rural canton, since 1352\n Zug, city canton, since 1352\n Berne, city canton, since 1353; associate since 1323\n15th century: expansion to the Zehn\u00f6rtige Eidgenossenschaft following the Burgundian Wars:\n Fribourg, city canton, since 1481; associate since 1454\n Solothurn, city canton, since 1481; associate since 1353\n16th century: expansion to the Dreizehn\u00f6rtige Eidgenossenschaft  following the Swabian War:\n Basel, city canton, since 1501\n Schaffhausen, city canton, since 1501; associate since 1454\n Appenzell, rural canton, since 1513; associate since 1411\n\n\n=== Associates ===\n\nAssociates (Zugewandte Orte) were close allies of the Old Swiss Confederacy, connected to the union by alliance treaties with all or some of the individual members of the confederacy.\n\n\n==== Closest associates ====\nThree of the associates were known as Engere Zugewandte:\n\n Biel \u2013 1344\u201382 treaties with Fribourg, Berne and Solothurn.

The Three Leagues together concluded an alliance pact with Berne in 1602.\n Grey League, who had been allied with Glarus, Uri and Obwalden through pacts from 1400, 1407 and 1419, entered an alliance with seven of the old eight cantons (the Acht Orte without Berne) in 1497\n League of God's House (Gotteshausbund) followed suit a year later.\n League of the Ten Jurisdictions, the third of the leagues, entered an alliance with Z\u00fcrich and Glarus in 1590.\n\n\n==== Protestant associates ====\nThere were two Evangelische Zugewandte:\n\n Imperial City of Mulhouse \u2013 Concluded a first treaty with some cantons in 1466 and became an associate in 1515 through a treaty with all 13 members of the Confederacy, remaining so until events of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1797.\n Imperial City of Geneva \u2013 1536 treaty with Berne and a 1584 treaty with Z\u00fcrich and Berne.\n\n\n==== Other ====\n County of Neuch\u00e2tel \u2013 1406 and 1526 treaties with Berne and Solothurn, 1495 treaty with Fribourg and 1501 treaty with Lucerne.\n Imperial Valley of Urseren \u2013 1317 treaty with Uri; annexed by Uri in 1410.\n Weggis \u2013 1332\u20131380 by treaties with Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden and Lucerne; annexed by Lucerne in 1480.\n Murten \u2013 from 1353 by treaty with Berne; became a confederal condominium in 1475.\n Payerne \u2013 from 1353 by treaty with Berne; annexed by Berne in 1536.\n Vogtei of Bellinzona \u2013 from 1407 by treaty with Uri and Obwalden; became a confederal condominium from 1419\u201322.\n County of Sargans \u2013 from 1437 by treaty with Glarus and Schwyz; became a confederal condominium in 1483.\n Barony of Sax-Forstegg \u2013 from 1458 by treaty with Z\u00fcrich; annexed by Z\u00fcrich in 1615\n Stein am Rhein \u2013 from 1459 by treaty with Z\u00fcrich and Schaffhausen; annexed by Z\u00fcrich in 1484.\n County of Gruy\u00e8re \u2013 had been allied with Fribourg and Berne since the early 14th century, becoming a full associate of the Confederation in 1548. When the counts fell bankrupt in 1555, the country was partitioned in twain:Lower Gruy\u00e8re \u2013 from 1475 by treaty with Fribourg\nUpper Gruy\u00e8re \u2013 from 1403 by treaty with Berne; annexed by Berne in 1555:\n Imperial Valley of Saanen\n Imperial Valley of Ch\u00e2teau-d'\u0152x\n County of Werdenberg \u2013 from 1493 by treaty with Lucerne; annexed by Glarus in 1517.\n Imperial City of Rottweil \u2013 from 1519\u20131632 through a treaty with all 13 members; a first treaty on military cooperation had already been concluded in 1463.

They were governed by reeves (V\u00f6gte) delegated for two years, each time from another of the responsible cantons. Berne initially did not participate in the administration of some of the eastern condominiums, as it had no part in their conquest and its interests were focused more on the western border. In 1712, Berne replaced the Catholic cantons in the administration of the Freie \u00c4mter (\"Free Districts\"), the Thurgau, the Rhine valley, and Sargans, and furthermore the Catholic cantons were excluded from the administration of the County of Baden.\n\n\n==== German bailiwicks ====\nThe \"German bailiwicks\" (German: Deutsche Gemeine Vogteien, Gemeine Herrschaften) were generally governed by the Acht Orte apart from Berne until 1712, when Bern joined the sovereign powers:\n\n Freie \u00c4mter \u2013 conquered 1415 and partitioned in 1712:\nUpper Freiamt was governed by the Acht Orte;\nLower Freiamt was governed by Z\u00fcrich, Bern and Glarus alone.\n County of Baden \u2013 conquered 1415; from 1712 governed by Z\u00fcrich, Bern and Glarus.\n County of Sargans \u2013 from 1460/83\n Landgraviate of Thurgau \u2013 from 1460\n Vogtei of Rheintal \u2013 from 1490, Acht Orte minus Bern, plus the Imperial Abbey of St Gall. Appenzell added in 1500; Berne added in 1712.\n\n\n==== Italian bailiwicks ====\n\nSeveral bailiwicks (Vogteien) were generally referred to as \"transmontane bailiwicks\" (German: Ennetbergische Vogteien, Italian: Baliaggi Ultramontani).\nIn 1440, Uri conquered the Leventina Valley from the Visconti, dukes of Milan. Some of this territory had previously been annexed between 1403 and 1422. Further territories were acquired in 1500; see History of Ticino for further details.\nThree bailiwicks, all now in the Ticino, were condominiums of the Forest cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Nidwalden:\n\nVogtei of Blenio \u2013 1477\u201380 and from 1495\nVogtei of Rivera \u2013 1403\u201322 and from 1495\nVogtei of Bellinzona \u2013 from 1500Four other Ticinese bailiwicks were condominiums of the Zw\u00f6lf Orte (the original 13 cantons, minus Appenzell) from 1512:\n\nLandvogtei of Valmaggia\nLandvogtei of Lugano\nLandvogtei of Locarno\nLandvogtei of MendrisioAnother three bailiwicks were condominiums of the Zw\u00f6lf Orte from 1512, but were lost from the Confederacy three years later and are all now comuni of Lombardy:\n\nTravaglia\nCuvio\nEschental (now Ossola)\n\n\n==== Two-party condominiums ====\n\n\n===== Bern and Fribourg =====\n County of Grasburg / Schwarzenburg \u2013 from 1423\n Murten \u2013 from 1475\n Grandson \u2013 from 1475\n Orbe and Echallens \u2013 from 1475\n\n\n===== Glarus and Schwyz =====\n Uznach \u2013 from 1437\n, Windegg / Gaster \u2013 from 1438\n  Hohensax / Gams \u2013 from 1497\n\n\n===== Condominiums with third-parties =====\nLordship of Tessenberg \u2013 from 1388, condominium between Berne and Bishopric of Basel\n\n\n=== Protectorates ===\n Bellelay Abbey \u2013 protectorate of Bern, Biel and Solothurn from 1414; nominally under the jurisdiction of the Bishopric of Basel\n Einsiedeln Abbey \u2013 protectorate of Schwyz from 1357\n Engelberg Abbey \u2013 protectorate of Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden from 1425\n Erguel \u2013 protectorate of Biel/Bienne under military jurisdiction from 1335; also subject to the Bishopric of Basel\n Imperial Abbey of St. Gallen \u2013 protectorate of Schwyz, Lucerne, Z\u00fcrich and Glarus from 1451; the abbey was simultaneously a Zugewandter Ort.\n Republic of Gersau, an independent village \u2013 allied with Schwyz since 1332; Lucerne, Uri and Unterwalden were also protecting powers.\n Moutier-Grandval Abbey \u2013 protectorate of Berne from 1486; the abbey was also subject to the Bishopric of Basel and, until 1797, the Holy Roman Empire\n La Neuveville \u2013 protectorate of Berne from 1388; also subject to the Bishopric of Basel.\n Pf\u00e4fers Abbey \u2013 protectorate of the Acht Orte minus Berne from 1460; annexed to the County of Sargans in 1483\n Rapperswil \u2013 protectorate of Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden and Glarus from 1464; of Z\u00fcrich, Berne and Glarus from 1712\n County of Toggenburg \u2013 protectorate of Schwyz and Glarus from 1436; of Z\u00fcrich and Berne from 1718.

The Swiss Confederacy fell to invasion by the French Revolutionary Army in 1798, after which it became the short-lived Helvetic Republic.\n\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe adjective \"old\" was introduced after the Napoleonic era with Ancien R\u00e9gime, retronyms distinguishing the pre-Napoleonic from the restored confederation. During its existence the confederacy was known as Eidgenossenschaft or Eydtgnoschafft (\"oath fellowship\"), in reference to treaties among cantons; this term was first used in the 1370 Pfaffenbrief. Territories of the confederacy came to be known collectively as Schweiz or Schweizerland (Schwytzerland in contemporary spelling), with the English Switzerland beginning during the mid-16th century. From that time the Confederacy was seen as a single state, also known as the Swiss Republic (Republic der Schweitzer, R\u00e9publique des Suisses and Republica Helvetiorum by Josias Simmler in 1576) after the fashion of calling individual urban cantons republics (such as the Republics of Z\u00fcrich, Berne and Basel).\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Foundation ===\n\nThe nucleus of the Old Swiss Confederacy was an alliance among the valley communities of the central Alps to facilitate management of common interests (such as trade) and ensure peace along trade routes through the mountains. The foundation of the Confederacy is marked by the R\u00fctlischwur (dated to 1307 by Aegidius Tschudi) or the 1315 Pact of Brunnen.\nSince 1889, the Federal Charter of 1291 among the rural communes of Uri, Schwyz, and Unterwalden has been considered the founding document of the confederacy.\n\n\n=== Expansion ===\n\nThe initial pact was augmented by pacts with the cities of Lucerne, Z\u00fcrich, and Berne. This union of rural and urban communes, which enjoyed the status of imperial immediacy within the Holy Roman Empire, was engendered by pressure from Habsburg dukes and kings who had ruled much of the land. In several battles with Habsburg armies, the Swiss were victorious; they conquered the rural areas of Glarus and Zug, which became members of the confederacy.From 1353 to 1481, the federation of eight cantons\u2014known in German as the Acht Orte (Eight Cantons)\u2014consolidated its position. The members (especially the cities) enlarged their territory at the expense of local counts\u2014primarily by buying judicial rights, but sometimes by force. The Eidgenossenschaft, as a whole, expanded through military conquest: the Aargau was conquered in 1415 and the Thurgau in 1460. In both cases, the Swiss profited from weakness in the Habsburg dukes. In the south, Uri led a military territorial expansion that (after many setbacks) would by 1515 lead to the conquest of the Ticino.\nNone of these territories became members of the confederacy; they had the status of condominiums (regions administered by several cantons).\nAt this time, the eight cantons gradually increased their influence on neighbouring cities and regions through additional alliances. Individual cantons concluded pacts with Fribourg, Appenzell, Schaffhausen, the abbot and the city of St. Gallen, Biel, Rottweil, Mulhouse and others. These allies (known as the Zugewandte Orte) became closely associated with the confederacy, but were not accepted as full members.\nThe Burgundy Wars prompted a further enlargement of the confederacy; Fribourg and Solothurn were accepted in 1481. In the Swabian War against Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, the Swiss were victorious and exempted from imperial legislation. The associated cities of Basel and Schaffhausen joined the confederacy as a result of that conflict, and Appenzell followed suit in 1513 as the thirteenth member. The federation of thirteen cantons (Dreizehn Orte) constituted the Old Swiss Confederacy until its demise in 1798.\nThe expansion of the confederacy was stopped by the Swiss defeat in the 1515 Battle of Marignano. Only Berne and Fribourg were still able to conquer the Vaud in 1536; the latter primarily became part of the canton of Berne, with a small portion under the jurisdiction of Fribourg.\n\n\n=== Reformation ===\n\nThe Reformation in Switzerland led to doctrinal division amongst the cantons. Z\u00fcrich, Berne, Basel, Schaffhausen and associates Biel, Mulhouse, Neuch\u00e2tel, Geneva and the city of St. Gallen became Protestant; other members of the confederation and the Valais remained Catholic. In Glarus, Appenzell, in the Grisons and in most condominiums both religions coexisted; Appenzell split in 1597 into a Catholic Appenzell Inner Rhodes and a Protestant Appenzell Outer Rhodes.\nThe division led to civil war (the Wars of Kappel) and separate alliances with foreign powers by the Catholic and Protestant factions, but the confederacy as a whole continued to exist. A common foreign policy was blocked, however, by the impasse. During the Thirty Years' War, religious disagreements among the cantons kept the confederacy neutral and spared it from belligerents. At the Peace of Westphalia, the Swiss delegation was granted formal recognition of the confederacy as a state independent of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n\n=== Early modern period ===\n\nGrowing social differences and an increasing absolutism in the city cantons during the Ancien R\u00e9gime led to local popular revolts. An uprising during the post-war depression after the Thirty Years' War escalated to the Swiss peasant war of 1653 in Lucerne, Berne, Basel, Solothurn and the Aargau. The revolt was put down swiftly by force and with the help of many cantons.\nReligious differences were accentuated by a growing economic discrepancy. The Catholic, predominantly rural central-Swiss cantons were surrounded by Protestant cantons with increasingly commercial economies. The politically dominant cantons were Z\u00fcrich and Berne (both Protestant), but the Catholic cantons were influential since the Second War of Kappel in 1531. A 1655 attempt (led by Z\u00fcrich) to restructure the federation was blocked by Catholic opposition, which led to the first battle of Villmergen in 1656; the Catholic party won, cementing the status quo. The problems remained unsolved, erupting again in 1712 with the second battle of Villmergen. This time the Protestant cantons won, dominating the confederation. True reform, however, was impossible; the individual interests of the thirteen members were too diverse, and the absolutist cantonal governments resisted all attempts at confederation-wide administration. Foreign policy remained fragmented.\n\n\n=== Collapse ===\n\nAttempting to gain control of key Alpine passes and establish a buffer against hostile monarchies, France first invaded associates of the Swiss Confederation; part of the bishopric of Basel was absorbed by France in 1793. In 1797, Napoleon annexed the Valtellina (on the border with Graub\u00fcnden) into the new Cisalpine Republic in northern Italy and invaded the southern remainder of the bishopric of Basel.In 1798 the confederacy was invaded by the French Revolutionary Army at the invitation of the Republican faction in Vaud, led by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric-C\u00e9sar de La Harpe. Vaud was under Bernese control, but chafed under a government with a different language and culture. The ideals of the French Revolution found a receptive audience in Vaud, and when Vaud declared itself a republic the French had a pretext to invade the confederation.\nThe invasion was largely peaceful (since the Swiss people failed to respond to political calls to take up arms), and the collapse of the confederacy was due more to internal strife than external pressure. Only Bern put up an effective resistance, but after its defeat in the March Battle of Grauholz it capitulated. The canton of Bern was divided into the canton of Oberland (with Thun as its capital) and the canton of L\u00e9man (with Lausanne as its capital).\nThe Helvetic Republic was proclaimed on 12 April 1798 as \"one and indivisible\", abolishing cantonal sovereignty and feudal rights and reducing the cantons to administrative districts. This system was unstable due to widespread opposition, and the Helvetic Republic collapsed as a result of the Stecklikrieg. A federalist compromise solution was attempted, but conflict between the federalist elite and republican subjects persisted until the formation of the federal state in 1848.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\nThe (Alte) Eidgenossenschaft was initially united not by a single pact, but by overlapping pacts and bilateral treaties between members. The parties generally agreed to preserve the peace, aid in military endeavours and arbitrate disputes. Slowly, the members began to see the confederation as a unifying entity. In the Pfaffenbrief, a treaty of 1370 among six of the eight members (Glarus and Berne did not participate) forbidding feuds and denying clerical courts jurisdiction over the confederacy, the cantons for the first time used the term Eidgenossenschaft. The first treaty uniting the eight members of the confederacy was the Sempacherbrief of 1393, concluded after victories over the Habsburgs at Sempach in 1386 and N\u00e4fels in 1388, which forbade a member from unilaterally beginning a war without the consent of the other cantons. A federal diet, the Tagsatzung, developed during the 15th century.\nPacts and renewals (or modernizations) of earlier alliances reinforced the confederacy. The individual interests of the cantons clashed in the Old Z\u00fcrich War (1436\u20131450), caused by territorial conflict among Z\u00fcrich and the central Swiss cantons over the succession of the Count of Toggenburg. Although Z\u00fcrich entered an alliance with the Habsburg dukes, it then rejoined the confederacy. The confederation had become so close a political alliance that it no longer tolerated separatist tendencies in its members.\n\nThe Tagsatzung was the confederation council, typically meeting several times a year. Each canton delegated two representatives (including the associate states, which had no vote). The canton where the delegates met initially chaired the gathering, but during the 16th century Z\u00fcrich permanently assumed the chair (Vorort) and Baden became the seat. The Tagsatzung dealt with inter-cantonal affairs and was the court of last resort in disputes between member states, imposing sanctions on dissenting members. It also administered the condominiums; the reeves were delegated for two years, each time by a different canton.A unifying treaty of the Old Swiss Confederacy was the Stanser Verkommnis of 1481. Conflicts between rural and urban cantons and disagreements over the bounty of the Burgundian Wars had led to skirmishes. The city-states of Fribourg and Solothurn wanted to join the confederacy, but were distrusted by the central Swiss rural cantons. The compromise by the Tagsatzung in the Stanser Verkommnis restored order and assuaged the rural cantons' complaints, with Fribourg and Solothurn accepted into the confederation. While the treaty restricted freedom of assembly (many skirmishes arose from unauthorised expeditions by soldiers from the Burgundian Wars), it reinforced agreements amongst the cantons in the earlier Sempacherbrief and Pfaffenbrief.\nThe civil war during the Reformation ended in a stalemate. The Catholic cantons could block council decisions but, due to geographic and economic factors, could not prevail over the Protestant cantons. Both factions began to hold separate councils, still meeting at a common Tagsatzung (although the common council was deadlocked by disagreements between both factions until 1712, when the Protestant cantons gained power after their victory in the second war of Villmergen). The Catholic cantons were excluded from administering the condominiums in the Aargau, the Thurgau and the Rhine valley; in their place, Berne became co-sovereign of these regions.\n\n\n== List of territories ==\n\n\n=== Cantons ===\n\nThe confederation expanded in several stages: first to the Eight Cantons (Acht Orte), then in 1481 to ten, in 1501 to twelve, and finally to thirteen cantons (Dreizehn Orte).\nFounding cantons (Urkantone):\n Uri, founding canton named in the Federal Charter of 1291\n Schwyz, founding canton named in the Federal Charter of 1291\n Unterwalden, founding canton  named in the Federal Charter of 1291\n14th century: expansion to the Acht\u00f6rtige Eidgenossenschaft following the battles of Morgarten and Laupen:\n Lucerne, city canton, since 1332\n Z\u00fcrich, city canton, since 1351\n Glarus, rural canton, since 1352\n Zug, city canton, since 1352\n Berne, city canton, since 1353; associate since 1323\n15th century: expansion to the Zehn\u00f6rtige Eidgenossenschaft following the Burgundian Wars:\n Fribourg, city canton, since 1481; associate since 1454\n Solothurn, city canton, since 1481; associate since 1353\n16th century: expansion to the Dreizehn\u00f6rtige Eidgenossenschaft  following the Swabian War:\n Basel, city canton, since 1501\n Schaffhausen, city canton, since 1501; associate since 1454\n Appenzell, rural canton, since 1513; associate since 1411\n\n\n=== Associates ===\n\nAssociates (Zugewandte Orte) were close allies of the Old Swiss Confederacy, connected to the union by alliance treaties with all or some of the individual members of the confederacy.\n\n\n==== Closest associates ====\nThree of the associates were known as Engere Zugewandte:\n\n Biel \u2013 1344\u201382 treaties with Fribourg, Berne and Solothurn.

They were governed by reeves (V\u00f6gte) delegated for two years, each time from another of the responsible cantons. Berne initially did not participate in the administration of some of the eastern condominiums, as it had no part in their conquest and its interests were focused more on the western border. In 1712, Berne replaced the Catholic cantons in the administration of the Freie \u00c4mter (\"Free Districts\"), the Thurgau, the Rhine valley, and Sargans, and furthermore the Catholic cantons were excluded from the administration of the County of Baden.\n\n\n==== German bailiwicks ====\nThe \"German bailiwicks\" (German: Deutsche Gemeine Vogteien, Gemeine Herrschaften) were generally governed by the Acht Orte apart from Berne until 1712, when Bern joined the sovereign powers:\n\n Freie \u00c4mter \u2013 conquered 1415 and partitioned in 1712:\nUpper Freiamt was governed by the Acht Orte;\nLower Freiamt was governed by Z\u00fcrich, Bern and Glarus alone.\n County of Baden \u2013 conquered 1415; from 1712 governed by Z\u00fcrich, Bern and Glarus.\n County of Sargans \u2013 from 1460/83\n Landgraviate of Thurgau \u2013 from 1460\n Vogtei of Rheintal \u2013 from 1490, Acht Orte minus Bern, plus the Imperial Abbey of St Gall. Appenzell added in 1500; Berne added in 1712.\n\n\n==== Italian bailiwicks ====\n\nSeveral bailiwicks (Vogteien) were generally referred to as \"transmontane bailiwicks\" (German: Ennetbergische Vogteien, Italian: Baliaggi Ultramontani).\nIn 1440, Uri conquered the Leventina Valley from the Visconti, dukes of Milan. Some of this territory had previously been annexed between 1403 and 1422. Further territories were acquired in 1500; see History of Ticino for further details.\nThree bailiwicks, all now in the Ticino, were condominiums of the Forest cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Nidwalden:\n\nVogtei of Blenio \u2013 1477\u201380 and from 1495\nVogtei of Rivera \u2013 1403\u201322 and from 1495\nVogtei of Bellinzona \u2013 from 1500Four other Ticinese bailiwicks were condominiums of the Zw\u00f6lf Orte (the original 13 cantons, minus Appenzell) from 1512:\n\nLandvogtei of Valmaggia\nLandvogtei of Lugano\nLandvogtei of Locarno\nLandvogtei of MendrisioAnother three bailiwicks were condominiums of the Zw\u00f6lf Orte from 1512, but were lost from the Confederacy three years later and are all now comuni of Lombardy:\n\nTravaglia\nCuvio\nEschental (now Ossola)\n\n\n==== Two-party condominiums ====\n\n\n===== Bern and Fribourg =====\n County of Grasburg / Schwarzenburg \u2013 from 1423\n Murten \u2013 from 1475\n Grandson \u2013 from 1475\n Orbe and Echallens \u2013 from 1475\n\n\n===== Glarus and Schwyz =====\n Uznach \u2013 from 1437\n, Windegg / Gaster \u2013 from 1438\n  Hohensax / Gams \u2013 from 1497\n\n\n===== Condominiums with third-parties =====\nLordship of Tessenberg \u2013 from 1388, condominium between Berne and Bishopric of Basel\n\n\n=== Protectorates ===\n Bellelay Abbey \u2013 protectorate of Bern, Biel and Solothurn from 1414; nominally under the jurisdiction of the Bishopric of Basel\n Einsiedeln Abbey \u2013 protectorate of Schwyz from 1357\n Engelberg Abbey \u2013 protectorate of Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden from 1425\n Erguel \u2013 protectorate of Biel/Bienne under military jurisdiction from 1335; also subject to the Bishopric of Basel\n Imperial Abbey of St. Gallen \u2013 protectorate of Schwyz, Lucerne, Z\u00fcrich and Glarus from 1451; the abbey was simultaneously a Zugewandter Ort.\n Republic of Gersau, an independent village \u2013 allied with Schwyz since 1332; Lucerne, Uri and Unterwalden were also protecting powers.\n Moutier-Grandval Abbey \u2013 protectorate of Berne from 1486; the abbey was also subject to the Bishopric of Basel and, until 1797, the Holy Roman Empire\n La Neuveville \u2013 protectorate of Berne from 1388; also subject to the Bishopric of Basel.\n Pf\u00e4fers Abbey \u2013 protectorate of the Acht Orte minus Berne from 1460; annexed to the County of Sargans in 1483\n Rapperswil \u2013 protectorate of Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden and Glarus from 1464; of Z\u00fcrich, Berne and Glarus from 1712\n County of Toggenburg \u2013 protectorate of Schwyz and Glarus from 1436; of Z\u00fcrich and Berne from 1718.

Eidgenossenschaft, after the Reformation also Corps des Suisses, Confoederatio helvetica \"Confederation of the Swiss\") was a loose confederation of independent small states (cantons, German Orte or St\u00e4nde) initially within the Holy Roman Empire. It is the precursor of the modern state of Switzerland.\nIt formed during the 14th century, from a nucleus in what is now Central Switzerland,  expanding to include the cities of Z\u00fcrich and Berne by the middle of the century. This formed a rare union of rural and urban communes, all of which enjoyed imperial immediacy in the Holy Roman Empire.\nThis confederation of eight cantons (Acht Orte) was politically and militarily successful for more than a century, culminating in the Burgundy Wars of the 1470s which established it as a power in the complicated political landscape dominated by France and the Habsburgs. Its success resulted in the addition of more confederates, increasing the number of cantons to thirteen (Dreizehn Orte) by 1513. The confederacy pledged neutrality in 1647 (under the threat of the Thirty Years' War), although many Swiss served privately as mercenaries in the Italian Wars and during the Early Modern period.\nAfter the Swabian War of 1499 the confederacy was a de facto independent state throughout the early modern period, although still nominally part of the Holy Roman Empire until 1648 when the Treaty of Westphalia ended the Thirty Years' War. The Swiss Reformation divided the confederates into Reformed and Catholic parties, resulting in internal conflict from the 16th to the 18th centuries; as a result, the federal diet (Tagsatzung) was often paralysed by hostility between the factions. The Swiss Confederacy fell to invasion by the French Revolutionary Army in 1798, after which it became the short-lived Helvetic Republic.\n\n"}, "Eidgenossenschaft": {"links": ["German language", "Edict", "Latin", "Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor", "Old Swiss Confederacy", "Hanseatic League", "Swiss citizen", "Bern", "Canton of Lucerne", "Oath", "Canton of Schwyz", "ETH Zurich", "Unterwalden", "R\u00fctlischwur", "James Vibert", "Canton of Zurich", "Thirteen Cantons", "Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch", "Holy Roman Empire", "Switzerland", "Federal Palace of Switzerland", "Pact of Brunnen", "Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor", "Switzerland as a federal state", "Battle of Sempach", "Eight Cantons", "House of Luxembourg", "Pfaffenbrief", "Schwyz", "Golden Bull of thirteen fifty-six", "Habsburg", "Growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy", "St\u00e4dtebund", "Swiss historiography", "Canton of Uri", "Historical Dictionary of Switzerland", "Lombard League", "Communal movement in medieval Europe", "Confederation"], "content": "Eidgenossenschaft (German pronunciation: [\u02c8a\u026ad\u0261\u0259\u02ccn\u0254s\u0259n\u0283aft]) is a German word specific to the political history of Switzerland. \nIt means \"oath commonwealth\" or \"oath alliance\" in reference to the \"eternal pacts\" formed between the Eight Cantons of the Old Swiss Confederacy of the late medieval period, most notably in Swiss historiography being the R\u00fctlischwur between the three founding cantons Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden, traditionally dated to 1307. \nIn modern usage, it is the German term used as equivalent with \"Confederation\" in the official name of  Switzerland, Schweizerische Eidgenossenschaft, rendered Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration and Confederazione in French and Italian, respectively. The related adjective, eidgen\u00f6ssisch, officially translated as Swiss federal, is used in the name of organisations, for example the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.\nThe term Eidgenosse (literally: comrade by oath) refers to the individual members of the Eidgenossenschaft. It is attested as early as 1315, in the Pact of Brunnen (as Eitgenoze), referring to the\ncantons of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden. The abstract noun Eidgenossenschaft (mostly contracted to eidgnoszschaft  or eidgnoschaft) is attested in the 15th century.\nIn modern usage, Eidgenosse is sometimes used (in archaic or ironic usage) for   \"Swiss citizen\", especially for those citizens of purely Swiss origin, not immigrated.In a historical context, Eidgenossenschaft  refers to the medieval Swiss Confederacy, which grew from the 13th to the 16th century in central Europe, persisted until 1798 and then evolved into a federal state in the 19th century. When used in this sense, the eternal nature of the pact is necessary\u2014the members of the Dreizehn Orte (Thirteen Cantons), frequently made time-limited alliances sworn by oath with other partners, but such pacts were not considered an Eidgenossenschaft.\nThe members of an Eidgenossenschaft are called Eidgenossen (singular Eidgenosse).

The related adjective, eidgen\u00f6ssisch, officially translated as Swiss federal, is used in the name of organisations, for example the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.\nThe term Eidgenosse (literally: comrade by oath) refers to the individual members of the Eidgenossenschaft. It is attested as early as 1315, in the Pact of Brunnen (as Eitgenoze), referring to the\ncantons of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden. The abstract noun Eidgenossenschaft (mostly contracted to eidgnoszschaft  or eidgnoschaft) is attested in the 15th century.\nIn modern usage, Eidgenosse is sometimes used (in archaic or ironic usage) for   \"Swiss citizen\", especially for those citizens of purely Swiss origin, not immigrated.In a historical context, Eidgenossenschaft  refers to the medieval Swiss Confederacy, which grew from the 13th to the 16th century in central Europe, persisted until 1798 and then evolved into a federal state in the 19th century. When used in this sense, the eternal nature of the pact is necessary\u2014the members of the Dreizehn Orte (Thirteen Cantons), frequently made time-limited alliances sworn by oath with other partners, but such pacts were not considered an Eidgenossenschaft.\nThe members of an Eidgenossenschaft are called Eidgenossen (singular Eidgenosse).

and it can be obtained by birth or naturalisation.\nThe Swiss Citizenship Law is based on the following principles:\n\nTriple citizenship level (Swiss Confederation, canton, and municipality)\nAcquisition of citizenship through descent (jus sanguinis)\nPrevention of statelessnessSwiss nationals are citizens of their municipality of origin, their canton of origin, and the Confederation, in that order: a Swiss citizen is defined as someone who has the bourgeoisie of a Swiss municipality (article 37 of the Swiss Federal Constitution). They are entered in the family register of their place of origin. The manner by which Swiss citizens acquire their place of origin differs depending on whether they acquired Swiss citizenship by filiation (jus sanguinis), ordinary naturalisation, or facilitated naturalisation. Marriage has in and of itself no effect on the places of origin of the spouses.\n\n\n== Acquisition of Swiss citizenship ==\n\n\n=== Acquisition by filiation ===\nA child acquires Swiss citizenship at birth by either:\n\nBeing the child of a married couple of whom at least one parent is Swiss.\nBeing the child of a Swiss mother not married to the child's father.A child of a Swiss father not married to the mother is considered Swiss by birth when a link of paternity is declared; any children of that child also acquire Swiss citizenship by filiation.\nThe child of two Swiss citizens who are married at the time of the child's birth acquires the places of origin of the parent whose surname the child acquires.\n\n\n=== Foundlings ===\nA foundling acquires Swiss citizenship and the citizenship of the canton in which they are found. The canton decides which place of origin the child receives. Once paternity is determined, the child loses Swiss citizenship, unless this would leave him or her stateless.\n\n\n=== Adoption ===\nA child adopted by a Swiss parent acquires the place of origin of the Swiss parent, thereby acquiring Swiss nationality.\n\n\n=== Naturalisation ===\n\n\n==== Ordinary naturalisation ====\nOrdinary naturalisation in Switzerland is a cantonal competency but regulated by federal legislation. \nOn 20 June 2014, the two Chambers of the Swiss Parliament passed the Total Revision of the Federal Law Concerning the Acquisition and Loss of Swiss Nationality (R\u00e9vision totale de la loi sur l'acquisition et la perte de la nationalit\u00e9 suisse). The Law, first introduced in 2011 by the Swiss federal government, aimed to lower, among other requirements, the residency requirement from 12 years to 8 years. During the parliamentary debates and the ensuing disagreements between the more conservative National Council (lower house) and the more liberal Council of States (upper house), the residency requirement was increased to 10 years. The time spent in Switzerland between the ages of 8 and 18 is doubled when counted for purposes of applying for naturalisation, however, an applicant must have spent at least 6 years in Switzerland. The law also requires cantons to set a minimum residency requirement of between 2 and 5 years, as well as requiring applicants to have a permanent residency permit (Autorisation d'\u00e9tablissement), which is commonly referred as a C permit. Additionally, time spent in Switzerland with temporary admission (Permis d'admission provisoire) is halved counting the years spent in Switzerland for the purposes of naturalisation. The 2014 Total Revision of the Federal Law Concerning the Acquisition and Loss of Swiss Nationality entered into force on 1 January 2018.\nApplications for naturalisation submitted prior to the entry into force of the new nationality law will continue to be processed under the 1952 law.\nThe federal nationality law of 2014 imposes two formal conditions which an applicant for naturalisation must satisfy:\n\nTen years of lawful residence in Switzerland including three of the five years immediately preceding the application. The time spent in Switzerland between the ages of 8 and 18 is doubled when counted for purposes of applying for naturalisation, however, an applicant must have spent at least six years in Switzerland. An exception is made for registered partners of Swiss citizens where the registered partnership has lasted at least three years and the Swiss citizen was already a Swiss citizen at the moment of the conclusion of the partnership: the foreign registered partner must have lived a total of five years in Switzerland, including the year immediately preceding the application. Absences above 6 months are considered as ending residency.\nBe a permanent resident.In addition to the aforementioned formal conditions, the federal nationality law of 2014 also imposes material conditions which an applicant for naturalisation must meet:\nThe applicant must be well integrated,\nThe applicant must be familiar with life in Switzerland,\nThe applicant must not endanger Switzerland's interior or exterior security,\nThe applicant must show respect for public order and security,\nThe applicant must respect the values of the federal constitution,\nThe applicant must be able to communicate in a national language, both orally and in writing,\nThe applicant must participate in the economy or be in education,\nThe applicant must, if married, in a registered partnership, or a parent, encourage and support the integration of his or her spouse and/or minor childrenCantons can impose further requirements which are complementary to the federal requirements.\n\n\n==== Simplified naturalisation ====\n\n\n===== Confederation =====\nForeigners in the following categories may apply for simplified naturalisation:\n\nThe spouse of a Swiss citizen\nA person who was mistakenly treated as a Swiss citizen and believed himself to be a Swiss citizen\nWomen who lost Swiss citizenship through marriage to a non-Swiss citizen, or through the loss of Swiss citizenship by their husband, before 23 March 1992\nThe child of a naturalised person\nThird-generation immigrants\nChildren born to Swiss mothers who lost their citizenship due to marriage to a foreigner before 23 March 1992 but who later reacquired their former Swiss nationality\nChildren born to Swiss mothers who had acquired Swiss citizenship themselves on the basis of a previous marriage to a Swiss husband\nPersons born before 1 July 1985 whose mothers had acquired Swiss citizenship by descent, adoption, or naturalisation\n\n\n====== Simplified naturalisation by virtue of marriage ======\nA person married to a Swiss citizen may apply for Swiss citizenship by facilitated naturalisation after living in Switzerland for five years and having been married for at least three years. No language test is required, but one must show the following:\n\nintegration into the Swiss way of life;  \"Language is a requirement here\"\ncompliance with the Swiss rule of law;\nno danger to Switzerland's internal or external security.Children from the person's previous relationships (but not same-sex couples) are given citizenship along with the partner.\nIt is also possible for the spouse of a Swiss citizen to apply for facilitated naturalisation while residing overseas after the following:\n\nSix years of marriage to a Swiss citizen.\nClose ties to Switzerland, i.e. travelling regularly to Switzerland, being an active member of a Swiss club abroad, and/or having close relations to the family of their Swiss spouse.Spouses acquiring Swiss citizenship by facilitated naturalisation will acquire the citizenship of the place and canton of origin of their Swiss spouse.\n\n\n====== Simplified naturalisation for third generation immigrants ======\nThe federal constitution declares that the Confederation will facilitate the naturalisation of third generation immigrants (Art. 38 \u00a73 part a). Legislation has yet to be introduced describing the precise requirements for an application for facilitated naturalisation under article 38 \u00a73 part a.\n\n\n===== Canton of Vaud =====\nThe Canton of Vaud legislated in 2004 to allow for second-generation foreigners to acquire Swiss nationality more easily under the following conditions:\nThe applicant must meet the requirements set by federal law.\nAged between 14 and 25 years.\nHas completed at least five years of obligatory education in Switzerland.\nHas at least two years' residence in Vaud.\nHas not lived abroad since the end of his or her obligatory education, with the exception of temporary stays abroad for purposes of education.\nOne of the applicant's parents must currently be lawfully resident in Switzerland or have been so in the past.\nIntegration and command of the French Language.\nLawful behaviour.\nThe applicant must not represent a danger for Swiss national security.The 2004 law also facilitates the naturalisation of foreigners of the 3rd generation under the following conditions:\nThe applicant must meet the requirements set by federal law.\nAt least two years' residence in Vaud.\nThe applicant must have not resided outside Switzerland since his birth, with the exception of temporary stays abroad for purposes of education.\nIntegration and command of the French Language.\nThe applicant must not represent a danger for Swiss national security.\n\n\n===== Demographics =====\n\nThe yearly rate of naturalisation has quintupled over the 1990s and 2000s, from roughly 9,000 to 45,000 naturalisations per year.\nRelative to the population of resident foreigners, this amounts to an increase from 8% in 1990 to 27% in 2007, or relative to the number of Swiss citizens from 0.16% in 1990 to 0.73% in 2007.\n\n\n==== Reacquisition of Swiss nationality ====\nForeigners in the following category can apply to have their nationality restored:\n\nChildren whose mothers had acquired Swiss citizenship by virtue of marriage to a Swiss husband (before 31 December 1991).\nChildren of Swiss parents born abroad who were not registered at a Swiss representation abroad before their 22nd birthday can reacquire their nationality within a period of ten years immediately following their 22nd birthday.\nChildren for whom the ten year limit has expired can nevertheless still apply to recover their former Swiss nationality if they can prove a \"close relationship with Switzerland.\"\nFormer Swiss nationals whose Swiss citizenship ceased due to an application for release under articles 37-41 of the nationality law.Formal conditions:\nResidence in Switzerland or close links to Switzerland if resident abroad.\nThe applicant must respect Swiss public order and security.\nThe applicant must respect the values of the constitution.\nThe applicant must not endanger Switzerland's interior or exterior security.\nApplicants having ceased to be Swiss nationals due to expiry, release, or loss must apply within ten years of ceasing to be Swiss nationals. This rule does not apply to former nationals currently residing in Switzerland for at least three years.\n\n\n== Loss of Swiss citizenship ==\n\n\n=== Loss due to cessation of paternity ===\nA child whose Swiss citizenship depends on paternal links loses citizenship when those are cut.\n\n\n=== Loss due to adoption ===\nA Swiss child adopted by foreign parents is considered to have lost Swiss citizenship; if the adoption is subsequently annulled, the loss of nationality is retroactively invalidated.\n\n\n=== Loss due to birth abroad ===\nA Swiss citizen born abroad to at least one Swiss parent and holding at least one other nationality loses Swiss citizenship at age 25 if:\n\nThey have never been announced to the Swiss authorities, or\nThey have never written to the Swiss authorities expressing their desire to retain Swiss citizenship, or\nThey (or their guardians) have never sought to procure Swiss identity documents for them, i.e. a passport or an identity card.Equally, the child of a person who loses Swiss nationality in this manner also loses Swiss nationality.\nExceptionally, a person who has been prevented, against their will, from taking the necessary actions to retain Swiss citizenship may undertake the required actions within a delay of 1 year following the cessation of such hindrances.\n\n\n== Triple citizenship level within Swiss citizenship ==\nEach municipality in Switzerland maintains its own registry of citizens, which is separate from the registry of people living in the municipality. Many Swiss citizens do not live in their place of origin; therefore, they are often required by the municipality in which they live to get a certificate of citizenship (acte d'origine/Heimatschein/atto d'origine) from their place of origin. The constitution forbids discrimination based on one's place of origin, with the exception of bourgeoisies.\n\n\n== Dual nationality ==\nAccording to the Federal Office for Migration, there has been no restriction on multiple citizenship in Switzerland since 1 January 1992. Thus, foreigners who acquire Swiss citizenship and Swiss citizens who voluntarily acquire another citizenship keep their previous citizenship (subject to the laws of the other country). An estimated 60% of Swiss nationals living abroad in 1998 were multiple citizens.\nSince many nationality laws now allow both parents to transmit their nationality to their common child (and not only the father, as used to be often the case), many children automatically acquire multiple citizenship at birth. This is especially prevalent in Switzerland, since a relatively high proportion of the population holds a foreign passport (up to 54% in Geneva and 20% nationally). However, the Federal Office for Migration specially notes that this has not resulted in any significant practical problems. Military service, the most likely problem to arise, is usually done in the country where the applicant resides at the time of conscription.\nEven though Swiss nationality law permits multiple citizenship, a Swiss national who also holds another country's citizenship may be required to renounce a citizenship, if that foreign country's nationality law forbids such multiple citizenship.\n\n\n== Political discussions and referendums about Swiss citizenship in Switzerland in recent years ==\nSwiss citizenship laws have been widely debated over recent years. In comparison to other nationality laws, access to Swiss citizenship is relatively narrow and restricted, and several modifications to widen access to Swiss citizenship via constitutional initiatives and referendums have been proposed. The referendums on the matter \u2013 held in 1983, 1994, and 2004 \u2013 were all rejected by Swiss voters. In particular, during the referendum held in September 2004, Swiss voters rejected proposals to give some long-resident Swiss-born persons aged between 14 and 24 the right to apply for facilitated naturalisation (which bypasses cantonal and municipal requirements) and grant automatic Swiss citizenship to persons born in Switzerland with a parent also born in Switzerland.\nWhile minimal requirements for obtaining Swiss citizenship by naturalisation are set at the federal level, Swiss cantons and municipalities are free to introduce more stringent requirements. Some municipalities had previously had no procedure for allowing naturalisations, effectively rendering it impossible, such as in La Chaux in the Canton of Vaud. In 1999, the municipality of Emmen and the canton of Lucerne began using referendums to decide the outcome of naturalisation requests. The practice was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in July 2003. A referendum directed at legalizing this practice was rejected on 1 June 2008.\n\n\n== Rights and obligations of Swiss citizens ==\n\nSwiss citizens are entitled to\n\nvote in federal elections and referendums upon reaching the age of 18;\nrun for federal political office: the Federal Assembly, the Federal Council, and the Federal Court;\nstart and sign a popular initiative or a request for a facultative referendum;\nobtain a Swiss passport or a Swiss identity card.\nreturn to Switzerland at any time;\navoid deportation from Switzerland;\nbe able to live, work, study, buy property, and open up a business anywhere in the EU (through the bilateral agreements between Switzerland and the EU), Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway;Male Swiss citizens, including dual citizens, can be required to perform military service or civilian service (women can do it voluntarily). Male citizens who do not complete their military service or who do not do civilian service must pay a supplementary tax. Swiss citizens are not allowed to work for a foreign (non-Swiss) military, unless they are a citizen of \u2013 and are resident in \u2013 the country in question. Unmarried Swiss, Catholic males aged 19-30 years old who have completed basic training with the Swiss Armed Forces may join the Swiss Guard of the Vatican State, but the Guard is regarded as a police force, not as an army.\n\n\n=== Travel freedom of Swiss citizens ===\n\nVisa requirements for Swiss citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Switzerland. In May 2018, Swiss citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 185 countries and territories, ranking the Swiss passport 5th in the world according to the Visa Restrictions Index.\nThe Swiss nationality is ranked ninth, together with Ireland, in The Quality of Nationality Index (QNI). This index differs from the Visa Restrictions Index, which focuses on external factors including travel freedom.
