"Ap\u00e9ritifs (; French: [ape\u0281itif]) and digestifs () are drinks, typically alcoholic,  that are normally served before (ap\u00e9ritif) or after (digestif) a meal.\n\n\n== Ap\u00e9ritifs ==\nAn ap\u00e9ritif is an alcoholic beverage usually served before a meal to stimulate the appetite, and is usually dry rather than sweet. Common choices for an ap\u00e9ritif are vermouth; champagne; pastis; gin; ouzo; fino, amontillado or other styles of dry sherry (but not usually cream or oloroso blended sherry, which is very sweet and rich); and any still, dry, light white wine.An ap\u00e9ritif may be served with an hors d'oeuvre or amuse-bouche, such as crackers, cheese, p\u00e2t\u00e9, quiche or olives.Ap\u00e9ritif is a French word \"derived from the Latin verb aperire, which means to open\". The French colloquial word for ap\u00e9ritif is ap\u00e9ro.\n\n\n=== History ===\nThe fifth-century Christian ascetic Diadochos of Photiki says, \"People who wish to discipline the sexual organs should avoid drinking those artificial concoctions which are called 'aperitifs'\u2014presumably because they open a way to the stomach for the vast meal which is to follow.\" This would indicate that ap\u00e9ritifs have existed since at least the fifth century.In 1796, Turin distiller Antonio Carpano invented modern vermouth.The ap\u00e9ritif was introduced in France in 1846 when a French chemist, Joseph Dubonnet, created his eponymous wine-based drink as a means of delivering malaria-fighting quinine. The medicine was a bitter brew, so he developed a formula of herbs and spices to mask quinine's sharp flavor, and it worked so well that the recipe has remained well-guarded ever since. French Foreign Legion soldiers made use of it in mosquito-infested Northern Africa. Dubonnet's wife was so fond of the drink that she had all her friends try it, and its popularity spread.\n\nAp\u00e9ritifs were already widespread in the 19th century in Italy, where they were being served in fashionable caf\u00e9s in Turin (where they were born), Rome, Genoa, Florence, Milan and Venice. Ap\u00e9ritifs became very popular in Europe in the late 19th century. The popularity in Europe crossed the Atlantic and by 1900, they were also commonly served in the United States. The ap\u00e9ritif recrossed the Atlantic in the 1970s: the habit of a substantial food offering with the purchase of a drink during \"Happy Hour\" in the United States pushed the development of a more food-heavy ap\u00e9ritif in Italy as well.\nIn Spain and in some countries of Latin America, ap\u00e9ritifs have been a staple of tapas for centuries.\n\n\n=== Types ===\nThere is no single alcoholic drink that is always served as an ap\u00e9ritif. Fortified wine, liqueur, and dry champagne are probably the most common choices. Because it is served before dining, the emphasis is usually on dry rather than sweet, as a general guideline.\n\nIn France, the ap\u00e9ritif varies from region to region: pastis is popular in the south of France, Calvados brandy in the Normandy region, Cr\u00e9mant d'Alsace in the eastern region. Champagne wine or Cognac may also be served. Kir, also called Blanc-cassis, is a common and very popular ap\u00e9ritif-cocktail made with a measure of cr\u00e8me de cassis (blackcurrant liqueur) topped up with white wine like bourgogne aligot\u00e9. The word Kir Royal is used when white wine is replaced with a Champagne wine. A simple glass of red wine, such as Beaujolais nouveau, can also be presented as an ap\u00e9ritif, accompanied by amuse-bouches.\nIn Italy, vermouth or wine may be served as the ap\u00e9ritif (called aperitivo). Martini, Aperol Spritz and Campari with soda are also popular aperitivo drinks of choice.\nIn Greece, ouzo is a popular choice, except on Crete, where it is very common to take some Tsikoudia (raki) after a meal.\nIn the Eastern Mediterranean, arak is served with meze.\nIn Britain and Ireland sherry and dry madeira are traditional ap\u00e9ritifs.\n\n\n== Digestifs ==\nA digestif is an alcoholic beverage served after a meal, to aid digestion. When served after a coffee course, it may be called pousse-caf\u00e9. Digestifs are usually taken neat.\nCommon kinds of digestif include: \n\nBrandy (Cognac, Armagnac, alembic-made)\nChacha\nEaux de vie (fruit brandies, Schnapps, Calvados)\nPomace brandy (grappa)\nTsikoudia\nFortified wines (sweet sherry (usually cream or oloroso sherry), vermouth, port, madeira, and Ratafia)\nLiqueurs bitter or sweet (Drambuie, Amaretto, B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine, amari (such as fernet), herbal liqueur, Sambuca, Chartreuse, Grand Marnier, J\u00e4germeister, Irish Mist, Kahl\u00faa, limoncello, Herbs de Majorca, Beir\u00e3o, Unicum, Underberg, Fernet-Branca, Mirto, Malort)\nDistilled liquors (ouzo, schnapps, tequila or akvavit)\nLiquor cocktails (Black Russian, Rusty Nail, etc.)Bitter digestifs typically contain carminative herbs, which are thought to aid digestion.In many countries, people drink alcoholic beverages at lunch and dinner. Studies have found that when food is eaten before drinking alcohol, alcohol absorption is reduced and the rate at which alcohol is eliminated from the blood is increased. The mechanism for the faster alcohol elimination appears to be unrelated to the type of food. The mechanism is likely food-induced, which increases in alcohol-metabolizing enzymes and liver blood flow.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBitters\nHappy hour\nHors d'oeuvre\n\n\n== References =="
