Other flavorings can be used, such as vegetables and fresh herbs. \nThe liqueur is typical of the Mediterranean areas of Spain, Italy, and north-east of France (Champagne and Burgundy). In the south-central region of Italy (specifically Molise and Abruzzo) Ratafi\u00e0 is made exclusively with fresh cherries and Montepulciano d'Abruzzo wines.Lazzaroni\u2122 Amaretto, Luxardo\u2122 Albicocca, Kahlua\u2122, Heering\u2122 Original Cherry Liqueur, Alpenz\u2122 Saint Elizabeth Allspice Dram, Carlshamms\u2122 Flaggpunsch, Seale\u2122 John D. Taylor's Velvet Falernum are Ratafia liqueurs.\n\n\n== Fortified wine ==\nThe second type, ratafia de Champagne, a fortified wine, is a type of mistelle, a mixture of marc (grappa) and the unfermented juice of the grape, and is the type produced in France.\nD.H. Lescombes, in New Mexico, uses Moscato grapes fortified with brandy to stop the fermentation early, which keeps the residual sugar high.\n\n\n== Biscuit ==\na small macaroon flavoured with almonds\u2212 Collins English Dictionary\nRatafia Biscuits are made with ratafia essence, sweet almonds, apricot kernels, rosewater, egg white, sugar. Originally made with sweet and bitter almonds, now apricot kernels. Amaretto is a ratafia liquor, thus the ratafia biscuits.In 1727, The Compleat Housewife, by Eliza Smith included a recipe for To make Ratafia Bisket, with the ingredients: bitter almonds, sugar and egg white, making it a confection that is very similar to a modern macaroon.In 1789, The Complete Confectioner, by Frederick Nutt, a confectioner, formerly apprenticed with Domenico Negri, an Italian who opened \"The Pot and Pineapple\" confectionery shop at 7-8 Berkeley Square, London, founded 1757, included a recipe, \"No. 29. Ratafia Biscuits\":\n\nTake half a pound of sweet almonds, and half a pound of bitter almonds, and pound them in a mortar very fine, with whites of eggs ; put three pounds of powdered sugar, mix it well with the whites of eggs, to the proper thickness into a bason ; put two or three sheets of paper on the plate you bake on ; take your knife, and the spaddle made of wood, and drop them on the paper, let them be round, and about the size of a large nutmeg ; put them in the oven, which must be quick, let them have a fine brown, and all alike, but be careful they are not burnt at bottom, else they will not come off the paper when baked ; let them be cold before you take them off.\n\n\n== Other Uses ==\nRatafia essence was suggested in a BBC recipe in their 1940 publication Food Facts For The Kitchen Front, for making mock marzipan, along with soya flour, margarine and sugar.\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\n\nSources\n\nThis article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Chisholm, Hugh, ed.
