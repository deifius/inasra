Carroll lauded the concept of Ueki's power to turn trash into trees and the humor of the series, but called it \"another run of the mill shounen title\". He labeled Fukuchi's art style as \"simple\" and compared it to One Piece, as \"there is vagueness in a lot of detail\", but clarified that it is suited to the comedic tone of the story. Michael Aronson of Manga Life ranked the first volume as C+. He criticized the series for its similar premise to other action manga series and for its \"overly hyperactive\" characters. Aronson concluded; \"fans of hyper action series like One Piece and Dragon Ball will feel at home here. Anyone else will merely glaze over and out.\" Patti Martinson of Sequential Tart gave a 4/10 for the fourth volume. Martinson compared the content of the volume to the anime adaptation, and wrote; \"at times the manga made less sense than the DVD did. However, the characterizations seem to be slightly better, but not enough to make me see what happens in the next volume.\"\n\n\n=== Anime ===\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nWeb Sunday on Law of Ueki Plus (in Japanese)\nAvex Mode on The Law of Ueki (in Japanese)\nTV Tokyo on The Law of Ueki (in Japanese)\nFunimation's The Law of Ueki webpage at the Wayback Machine (archive index)\nGeneon's The Law of Ueki page at the Wayback Machine (archived September 2, 2006)\nThe Law of Ueki (manga) at Anime News Network's encyclopedia", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Wikipe-tan_face.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/93/Ueki_no_Hosoku_Vol_1_SS.jpg"], "summary": "The Law of Ueki (Japanese: \u3046\u3048\u304d\u306e\u6cd5\u5247, Hepburn: Ueki no H\u014dsoku) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Tsubasa Fukuchi.
