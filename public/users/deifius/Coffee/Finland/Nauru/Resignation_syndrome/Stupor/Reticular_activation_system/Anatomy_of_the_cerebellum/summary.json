"The anatomy of the cerebellum can be viewed at three levels.  At the level of gross anatomy, the cerebellum consists of a tightly folded and crumpled layer of cortex, with white matter underneath, several deep nuclei embedded in the white matter, and a fluid-filled ventricle in the middle. At the intermediate level, the cerebellum and its auxiliary structures can be broken down into several hundred or thousand independently functioning modules or compartments known as microzones.  At the microscopic level, each module consists of the same small set of neuronal elements, laid out with a highly stereotyped geometry."
