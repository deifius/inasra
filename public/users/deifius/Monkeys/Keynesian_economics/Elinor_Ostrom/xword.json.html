In 2009, she was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for her \"analysis of economic governance, especially the commons\", which she shared with Oliver E. Williamson. To date, she remains the first of only two women to win the Nobel Prize in Economics, the other being Esther Duflo.\nAfter graduating with a B.A. and Ph.D. from UCLA, Ostrom lived in Bloomington, Indiana, and served on the faculty of Indiana University, with a late-career affiliation with Arizona State University. She was Distinguished Professor at Indiana University and the Arthur F. Bentley Professor of Political Science and co-director of the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis at Indiana University, as well as research professor and the founding director of the Center for the Study of Institutional Diversity at Arizona State University in Tempe. She was a lead researcher for the Sustainable Agriculture and Natural Resource Management Collaborative Research Support Program (SANREM CRSP), managed by Virginia Tech and funded by USAID. Beginning in 2008, she and her husband Vincent Ostrom advised the journal Transnational Corporations Review.Since the 60s, Ostrom was involved in resource management policy and created a research center, which attracted scientists from different disciplines from around the world. Working and teaching at her center was created on the principle of a workshop, rather than a university with lectures and a strict hierarchy.\nOstrom studied the interaction of people and ecosystems for many years and showed that the use of exhaustible resources by groups of people (communities, cooperatives, trusts, trade unions) can be rational and prevent depletion of the resource without government intervention.\n\n\n== Personal life and education ==\nElinor Claire Awan was born in Los Angeles, California as the only child of Leah Hopkins, a musician, and Adrian Awan, a set designer. Her parents separated early in her life, and Elinor lived with her mother most of the time. She attended a Protestant church with her mother and often spent weekends with her father's Jewish family. Growing up in the post-Depression era to divorced artisans, Ostrom described herself as a \"poor kid.\" Her major recreational activity was swimming, where she eventually joined a swimming team and swam competitively until she started teaching swimming to earn funds to help put herself through college.Ostrom grew up across the street from Beverly Hills High School, which she attended, graduating in 1951. \nShe regarded this as fortunate, for the school had a very high rate of college admittance. During Ostrom's junior year, she was encouraged to join the debate team. Learning debate tactics had an important impact on her ways of thinking. It allowed her to realize there are two sides to public policy and it is imperative to have quality arguments for both sides. As a high school student, Elinor Ostrom had been discouraged from studying trigonometry, as girls without top marks in algebra and geometry were not allowed to take the subject. No one in her immediate family had any college experience, but seeing that 90% of students in her high school attended college, she saw it as the \"normal\" thing to do. Her mother did not wish for her to attend college, seeing no reason for it.She attended UCLA, receiving a B.A. (with honors) in political science at UCLA in 1954. By attending multiple summer session and extra classes throughout semesters, she was able to graduate in three years. She worked at the library, dime store and bookstore in order to pay her fees which were $50 per semester. \nShe married a classmate, Charles Scott, and worked at General Radio in Cambridge, Massachusetts, while Scott attended Harvard Law School. They divorced several years later when Ostrom began contemplating a Ph.D. After graduation, she had trouble finding a job because employers presumed that she was only looking for jobs as a teacher or secretary. She began a job as an export clerk after taking a correspondence course for shorthand, which she later found to be helpful when taking notes in face-to-face interviews on research projects. After a year, she obtained a position as assistant personnel manager in a business firm that had never before hired a woman in anything but a secretarial position. This job inspired her to think about attending graduate-level courses and eventually applying for a research assistantship and admission to a Ph.D. program.Lacking trigonometry from high school, she was consequently rejected for an economics Ph.D. at UCLA. She was admitted to UCLA's graduate program in political science, where she was awarded an M.A. in 1962 and a Ph.D. in 1965. The teams of graduate students she was involved with were analyzing the political economic effects of a group of groundwater basins in Southern California. Specifically, Ostrom was assigned to look at the West Basin. She found it is very difficult to manage a common-pool resource when it is used between individuals. The locals were pumping too much groundwater and salt water seeped into the basin. Ostrom was impressed with how people from conflicting and overlapping jurisdictions who depended on that source found incentives to settle contradictions and solve the problem. She made the study of this collaboration the topic of her dissertation, laying the foundation for the study of \"shared resources\". The postgraduate seminar was led by Vincent Ostrom, an associate professor of political science, 14 years her senior, whom she married in 1963. This marked the beginning of a lifelong partnership that named \"love and contestation\" as Ostrom put it in her dedication to her seminal 1990 book, Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action.In 1961 Vincent Ostrom, Charles Tiebout, and Robert Warren published \"The Organization of Government in Metropolitan Areas,\" which would go on to be an influential article and introduced themes that would be central to the Ostroms' work. However, the article aggravated a conflict with UCLA's Bureau of Governmental Research because, counter to the Bureau's interests, it advised against centralization of metropolitan areas in favor of polycentrism. This conflict prompted the Ostroms to leave UCLA. They moved to Bloomington, Indiana, in 1965, when Vincent accepted a political science professorship at Indiana University. She joined the faculty as Visiting Assistant Professor. The first course she taught was an evening class on American government.\n\n\n== Career ==\nOstrom is probably best known for revisiting the so-called \u201ctragedy of the commons\" \u2013 a theory proposed by biologist Garrett Hardin in 1968. \"In an article by the same name published in the journal Science, Hardin theorized that if each herdsman sharing a piece of common grazing land made the individually rational economic decision of increasing the number of cattle he keeps on the land, the collective effect would deplete or destroy the commons. In other words, multiple individuals\u2014acting independently and rationally consulting their own self-interest\u2014will ultimately deplete a shared limited resource, even when it is clear that it is not in anyone\u2019s long-term interest for this to happen. Ostrom believes that the \u201ctragedy\u201d in such situations isn\u2019t inevitable, as Hardin thought. Instead, if the herders decide to cooperate with one another, monitoring each other\u2019s use of the land and enforcing rules for managing it, they can avoid the tragedy.\"Garrett Hardin believes that the most important aspect that we need to realize today is the need to abandon the principle of shared resources in reproduction. A possible alternative to the tragedy of the commons (shared needs) was described in Elinor Ostrom's book \"Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action\". The book demonstrates on a factual material that there are practical algorithms for the collective use of a limited common resource, which allow the selfish behavior of stakeholders within the framework of the accepted algorithms for quoting and control, while the result of interaction is not devastation, but rational use and renewal of the resource. \nOstrom was richly informed by fieldwork, both her own and that of others. During her PhD at the University of California, Los Angeles, she spent years studying the water wars and pumping races going on in the 1950s in her own dry backyard. In contrast to the prevailing rational-economic predictions of Malthusianism and the tragedy of the commons, she showed cases where humans were not trapped and helpless amid diminishing supplies. In her book Governing the Commons, she draws on studies of irrigation systems in Spain and Nepal, mountain villages in Switzerland and Japan, and fisheries in Maine and Indonesia.\nIn 1973, Ostrom and her husband founded the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis at Indiana University. Examining the use of collective action, trust, and cooperation in the management of common pool resources (CPR), her institutional approach to public policy, known as the Institutional analysis and development framework (IAD), has been considered sufficiently distinct to be thought of as a separate school of public choice theory. She authored many books in the fields of organizational theory, political science, and public administration. Elinor Ostrom was a dedicated scholar until the very end of her life. Indeed, on the day before she died, she sent e-mail messages to at least two different sets of coauthors about papers that she was writing with them. She was the chief scientific advisor for the International Council for Science (ICSU) Planet Under Pressure meeting in London in March, and Johan Rockstrom of the Stockholm Resilience Centre wrote that \"Lin, up until the very end, was heavily involved in our preparations for the Nobel laureate dialogues on global sustainability we will be hosting in Rio 17th and 18th of June during the UN Rio+20 Earth Summit. In the end, she decided she could not come in person, but was contributing sharp, enthusiastically charged, inputs, in the way only she could.\"\nIt was long unanimously held among economists that natural resources that were collectively used by their users would be over-exploited and destroyed in the long-term. Elinor Ostrom disproved this idea by conducting field studies on how people in small, local communities manage shared natural resources, such as pastures, fishing waters and forests. She showed that when natural resources are jointly used by their users, in time, rules are established for how these are to be cared for and used in a way that is both economically and ecologically sustainable.She was senior research director of the Vincent and Elinor Ostrom Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis, Distinguished Professor and Arthur F. Bentley Professor of Political Science in the College of Arts and Sciences, and professor in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs.Ostrom's innovative and ground-breaking research was supported by National Science Foundation, the Andrew Mellon Foundation, the Hynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, U.S.A.I.D., the U.S. Geological Survey, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the National Institute of Mental Health.Ostrom has been involved in international activities throughout her long and productive career. Had experience in Kenya, Nepal and Nigeria, and also made research trips to Australia, Bolivia, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Philippines, Poland and Zimbabwe. During workshops and research grants, she and her husband supported many international students, visited researchers and policymakers. They did not have children of their own and used personal funds and efforts to receive grants to help others. In a 2010 interview, Ostrom noted that because they had no family to support, \u201cI was not ever concerned about salary, so that\u2019s never been an issue for me. For some colleagues who have big families, and all the rest, it\u2019s a major issue.\u201d Ostrom was a founding member and first president of the IASC (International Association for the Study of the Commons).\n\n\n== Research ==\nOstrom's early work emphasized the role of public choice on decisions influencing the production of public goods and services. Among her better known works in this area is her study on the polycentricity of police functions in Indianapolis. Caring for the commons had to be a multiple task, organised from the ground up and shaped to cultural norms. It had to be discussed face to face, and based on trust. Dr. Ostrom, besides poring over satellite data and quizzing lobstermen herself, enjoyed employing game theory to try to predict the behaviour of people faced with limited resources. In her Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis at Indiana University\u2014set up with her husband Vincent, a political scientist, in 1973\u2014her students were given shares in a national common. When they discussed what they should do before they did it, their rate of return from their \"investments\" more than doubled. Her later, and more famous, work focused on how humans interact with ecosystems to maintain long-term sustainable resource yields. Common pool resources include many forests, fisheries, oil fields, grazing lands, and irrigation systems. She conducted her field studies on the management of pasture by locals in Africa and irrigation systems management in villages of western Nepal (e.g., Dang Deukhuri). Her work has considered how societies have developed diverse institutional arrangements for managing natural resources and avoiding ecosystem collapse in many cases, even though some arrangements have failed to prevent resource exhaustion. Her work emphasized the multifaceted nature of human\u2013ecosystem interaction and argues against any singular \"panacea\" for individual social-ecological system problems.The Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis was meant to utilize diverse scholars throughout economics, political science, and other fields to collaborate and attempt to understand how institutional arrangements in a diverse set of ecological and social economic political settings affected behavior and outcomes. The goal was not to fly around the world collecting data, rather it is to create a network of scholars who live in particular areas of the world and had strong interests in forest conditions and forest policy conducted the studies.\n\n\n=== Design principles for Common Pool Resource (CPR) institution ===\nOstrom identified eight \"design principles\" of stable local common pool resource management:\nClearly defined  (clear definition of the contents of the common pool resource and effective exclusion of external un-entitled parties);\nThe appropriation and provision of common resources that are adapted to local conditions;\nCollective-choice arrangements that allow most resource appropriators to participate in the decision-making process;\nEffective monitoring by monitors who are part of or accountable to the appropriators;\nA scale of graduated sanctions for resource appropriators who violate community rules;\nMechanisms of conflict resolution that are cheap and of easy access;\nSelf-determination of the community recognized by higher-level authorities; and\nIn the case of larger common-pool resources, organization in the form of multiple layers of nested enterprises, with small local CPRs at the base level.These principles have since been slightly modified and expanded to include a number of additional variables believed to affect the success of self-organized governance systems, including effective communication, internal trust and reciprocity, and the nature of the resource system as a whole.Ostrom and her many co-researchers have developed a comprehensive \"Social-Ecological Systems (SES) framework\", within which much of the still-evolving theory of common-pool resources and collective self-governance is now located.\n\n\n=== Environmental protection ===\nAccording to the Norwegian Institute for Urban and Regional Research, \"Ostrom cautioned against single governmental units at global level to solve the collective action problem of coordinating work against environmental destruction. Partly, this is due to their complexity, and partly to the diversity of actors involved. Her proposal was that of a polycentric approach, where key management decisions should be made as close to the scene of events and the actors involved as possible.\" Ostrom helped disprove the idea held by economists that natural resources would be over-used and destroyed in the long run. Elinor Ostrom disproved this idea by conducting field studies on how people in small, local communities manage shared natural resources, such as pastures, fishing waters in Maine and Indonesia, and forests in Nepal. She showed that when natural resources are jointly managed by their users, in time, rules are established for how these are to be cared for and used in a way that is both economically and ecologically sustainable.\n\n\n=== Ostrom's law ===\nOstrom's law is an adage that represents how Elinor Ostrom's works in economics challenge previous theoretical frameworks and assumptions about property, especially the commons. Ostrom's detailed analyses of functional examples of the commons create an alternative view of the arrangement of resources that are both practically and theoretically possible. This eponymous law is stated succinctly by Lee Anne Fennell as:\n\nA resource arrangement that works in practice can work in theory.\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nOstrom was a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences, a member of the American Philosophical Society, and president of the American Political Science Association and the Public Choice Society. In 1999, she became the first woman to receive the prestigious Johan Skytte Prize in Political Science.Ostrom was awarded the Frank E. Seidman Distinguished Award for Political Economy in 1998. Her presented paper, on \"The Comparative Study of Public Economies\", was followed by a discussion among Kenneth Arrow, Thomas Schelling, and Amartya Sen. She was awarded the John J. Carty Award from the National Academy of Sciences in 2004, and, in 2005, received the James Madison Award by the American Political Science Association. In 2008, she became the first woman to receive the William H. Riker Prize in political science; and, the following year, she received the Tisch Civic Engagement Research Prize from the Jonathan M. Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service at Tufts University. In 2010, the Utne Reader magazine included Ostrom as one of the \"25 Visionaries Who Are Changing Your World\". She was named one of Time magazine's \"100 Most Influential People in the World\" in 2012.\n\nThe International Institute of Social Studies (ISS) awarded its Honorary Fellowship to her in 2002.In 2008 she was awarded an honorary degree, doctor honoris causa, at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.In July 2019, Indiana University Bloomington announced that as part of their Bridging the Visibility Gap initiative, a statue of Ostrom would be placed outside of the building which houses the University's political science department.\n\n\n=== Nobel Prize in Economics ===\nIn 2009, Ostrom became the first woman to receive the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences cited Ostrom \"for her analysis of economic governance\", saying her work had demonstrated how common property could be successfully managed by groups using it. Ostrom and Oliver E. Williamson shared the 10-million Swedish kronor (\u20ac990,000; $1.44 million) prize for their separate work in economic governance. As she had done with previous monetary prizes, Ostrom donated her award to the Workshop she helped to found.\n\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said Ostrom's \"research brought this topic from the fringe to the forefront of scientific attention...by showing how common resources\u2014forests, fisheries, oil fields or grazing lands\u2014can be managed successfully by the people who use them rather than by governments or private companies\". Ostrom's work in this regard challenged conventional wisdom, showing that common resources can be successfully managed without government regulation or privatization.In awarding Ostrom the Nobel Prize for the Analysis of Economic Governance, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences noted that her work \"teaches us novel lessons about the deep mechanisms that sustain cooperation in human societies.\" Even if Ostrom's selection (along with co-recipient Oliver Williamson of the University of California, Berkeley) seemed odd to some, others saw it as an appropriate reaction to free-market inefficiencies highlighted by the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\n== Death ==\nOstrom was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in October 2011. During the final year of her life, she continued to write and lecture, giving the Hayek Lecture at the Institute of Economic Affairs just eleven weeks before her death. She died at 6:40 a.m. Tuesday, June 12, 2012, at IU Health Bloomington Hospital at the age of 78. On the day of her death, she published her last article, \"Green from the Grassroots,\" in Project Syndicate. Indiana University president Michael McRobbie wrote: \"Indiana University has lost an irreplaceable and magnificent treasure with the passing of Elinor Ostrom\". Her Indiana colleague Michael McGinnis commented after her death that Ostrom donated her share of the $1.4 million Nobel award money to the Workshop\u2014the biggest, by far, of several academic prizes with monetary awards that the Ostroms had given to the center over the years. Her husband Vincent died 17 days later from complications related to cancer. He was 92.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nOstrom, Elinor (1990).

In 2009, she was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for her \"analysis of economic governance, especially the commons\", which she shared with Oliver E. Williamson. To date, she remains the first of only two women to win the Nobel Prize in Economics, the other being Esther Duflo.\nAfter graduating with a B.A. and Ph.D. from UCLA, Ostrom lived in Bloomington, Indiana, and served on the faculty of Indiana University, with a late-career affiliation with Arizona State University. She was Distinguished Professor at Indiana University and the Arthur F. Bentley Professor of Political Science and co-director of the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis at Indiana University, as well as research professor and the founding director of the Center for the Study of Institutional Diversity at Arizona State University in Tempe. She was a lead researcher for the Sustainable Agriculture and Natural Resource Management Collaborative Research Support Program (SANREM CRSP), managed by Virginia Tech and funded by USAID. Beginning in 2008, she and her husband Vincent Ostrom advised the journal Transnational Corporations Review.Since the 60s, Ostrom was involved in resource management policy and created a research center, which attracted scientists from different disciplines from around the world. Working and teaching at her center was created on the principle of a workshop, rather than a university with lectures and a strict hierarchy.\nOstrom studied the interaction of people and ecosystems for many years and showed that the use of exhaustible resources by groups of people (communities, cooperatives, trusts, trade unions) can be rational and prevent depletion of the resource without government intervention."}, "Nobel_Peace_Prize": {"links": ["Parliament of Norway Building", "List of Indian Nobel laureates", "Mohamed ElBaradei", "List of Nobel laureates affiliated with

Since March 1901, it has been awarded annually (with some exceptions) to those who have \"done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses\".In accordance with Alfred Nobel's will, the recipient is selected by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, a five-member committee appointed by the Parliament of Norway. Since 2020 the prize is awarded in the Atrium of the University of Oslo, where it was also awarded 1947\u20131989; the Abel Prize is also awarded in the building. The prize was previously awarded in Oslo City Hall (1990\u20132019), the Norwegian Nobel Institute (1905\u20131946), and the Parliament (1901\u20131904).\nDue to its political nature, the Nobel Peace Prize has, for most of its history, been the subject of numerous controversies. The most recent prize for 2021 was awarded to Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAccording to Nobel's will, the Peace Prize shall be awarded to the person who in the preceding year \"shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses\". Alfred Nobel's will further specified that the prize be awarded by a committee of five people chosen by the Norwegian Parliament.\n\nNobel died in 1896 and he did not leave an explanation for choosing peace as a prize category. As he was a trained chemical engineer, the categories for chemistry and physics were obvious choices. The reasoning behind the peace prize is less clear. According to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, his friendship with Bertha von Suttner, a peace activist and later recipient of the prize, profoundly influenced his decision to include peace as a category. Some Nobel scholars suggest it was Nobel's way to compensate for developing destructive forces. His inventions included dynamite and ballistite, both of which were used violently during his lifetime. Ballistite was used in war and the Irish Republican Brotherhood, an Irish nationalist organization, carried out dynamite attacks in the 1880s. Nobel was also instrumental in turning Bofors from an iron and steel producer into an armaments company.\nIt is unclear why Nobel wished the Peace Prize to be administered in Norway, which was ruled in union with Sweden at the time of Nobel's death. The Norwegian Nobel Committee speculates that Nobel may have considered Norway better suited to awarding the prize, as it did not have the same militaristic traditions as Sweden.  It also notes that at the end of the 19th century, the Norwegian parliament had become closely involved in the Inter-Parliamentary Union's efforts to resolve conflicts through mediation and arbitration.\n\n\n== Nomination and selection ==\n\nThe Norwegian Parliament appoints the Norwegian Nobel Committee, which selects the Nobel Peace Prize laureate.\n\n\n=== Nomination ===\nEach year, the Norwegian Nobel Committee specifically invites qualified people to submit nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize. The statutes of the Nobel Foundation specify categories of individuals who are eligible to make nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize. These nominators are:\n\nMembers of national assemblies and governments and members of the Inter-Parliamentary Union\nMembers of the Permanent Court of Arbitration and the International Court of Justice at the Hague\nMembers of Institut de Droit International\nAcademics at the professor or associate professor level in history, social sciences, philosophy, law, and theology, university rectors, university directors (or their equivalents), and directors of peace research and international affairs institutes\nPrevious recipients, including board members of organizations that have received the prize\nPresent and past members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee\nFormer permanent advisers to the Norwegian Nobel Institute\n\nThe working language of the Norwegian Nobel Committee is Norwegian; in addition to Norwegian the committee has traditionally received nominations in French, German and English, but today most nominations are submitted in either Norwegian or English. Nominations must usually be submitted to the committee by the beginning of February in the award year.  Nominations by committee members can be submitted up to the date of the first Committee meeting after this deadline.In 2009, a record 205 nominations were received, but the record was broken again in 2010 with 237 nominations; in 2011, the record was broken once again with 241 nominations. The statutes of the Nobel Foundation do not allow information about nominations, considerations, or investigations relating to awarding the prize to be made public for at least 50 years after a prize has been awarded. Over time, many individuals have become known as \"Nobel Peace Prize Nominees\", but this designation has no official standing, and means only that one of the thousands of eligible nominators suggested the person's name for consideration. Indeed, in 1939, Adolf Hitler received a satirical nomination from a member of the Swedish parliament, mocking the (serious but unsuccessful) nomination of Neville Chamberlain. Nominations from 1901 to 1967 have been released in a database.\n\n\n=== Selection ===\nNominations are considered by the Nobel Committee at a meeting where a shortlist of candidates for further review is created.  This shortlist is then considered by permanent advisers to the Nobel institute, which consists of the institute's Director and the Research Director and a small number of Norwegian academics with expertise in subject areas relating to the prize.  Advisers usually have some months to complete reports, which are then considered by the committee to select the laureate.  The Committee seeks to achieve a unanimous decision, but this is not always possible. The Nobel Committee typically comes to a conclusion in mid-September, but occasionally the final decision has not been made until the last meeting before the official announcement at the beginning of October.\n\n\n== Awarding the prize ==\n\nThe Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee presents the Nobel Peace Prize in the presence of the King of Norway and the Norwegian royal family on 10 December each year (the anniversary of Nobel's death). The Peace Prize is the only Nobel Prize not presented in Stockholm. The Nobel laureate receives a diploma, a medal, and a document confirming the prize amount. As of 2019, the prize was worth 9 million SEK. In 2020 the ceremony returned to its former venue, the Atrium of the University of Oslo Faculty of Law, after being held in Oslo City Hall during the period 1990\u20132019.From 1947 to 1989, the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony was held in the Atrium of the University of Oslo Faculty of Law, a few hundred meters from Oslo City Hall. Between 1905 and 1946, the ceremony took place at the Norwegian Nobel Institute. From 1901 to 1904, the ceremony took place in the Storting (Parliament).\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nSome commentators have suggested that the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded in politically motivated ways for more recent or immediate achievements, or with the intention of encouraging future achievements. Some commentators have suggested that to award a peace prize on the basis of the unquantifiable contemporary opinion is unjust or possibly erroneous, especially as many of the judges cannot themselves be said to be impartial observers. Further criticism holds that the Nobel Peace Prize has become increasingly politicized, in which people are awarded for aspiration rather than accomplishment, which has allowed for the prize to be used for political effect but can cause perverse consequences due to the neglect of existing power politics.In 2011, a feature story in the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten contended that major criticisms of the award were that the Norwegian Nobel Committee ought to recruit members from professional and international backgrounds, rather than retired members of parliament; that there is too little openness about the criteria that the committee uses when they choose a recipient of the prize; and that the adherence to Nobel's will should be more strict. In the article, Norwegian historian \u00d8ivind Stenersen argues that Norway has been able to use the prize as an instrument for nation-building and furthering Norway's foreign policy and economic interests.In another 2011 Aftenposten opinion article, the grandson of one of Nobel's two brothers, Michael Nobel, also criticised what he believed to be the politicisation of the award, claiming that the Nobel Committee has not always acted in accordance with Nobel's will.\n\n\n=== Criticism of individual conferments ===\n\nThe awards given to Mikhail Gorbachev, Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres and Yasser Arafat, L\u00ea \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1ecd, Henry Kissinger, Jimmy Carter, Al Gore, Liu Xiaobo, Barack Obama, and the European Union have all been the subject of controversy.\nThe joint award given to L\u00ea \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1ecd and Henry Kissinger prompted two dissenting Committee members to resign. Th\u1ecd refused to accept the prize, on the grounds that such \"bourgeois sentimentalities\" were not for him and that peace had not been achieved in Vietnam. Th\u1ecd said many year later that he did not want to share the prize with Kissinger, who he called \"the representative of American aggressors\". Kissinger donated his prize money to charity, did not attend the award ceremony and later offered to return his prize medal after the fall of South Vietnam to North Vietnamese forces 18 months later.In 1994, K\u00e5re Kristiansen resigned from the Norwegian Nobel Committee in protest over the award of the prize to Yasser Arafat, whom he labeled \"world's most prominent terrorist\".\n\n\n=== Notable omissions ===\nForeign Policy has listed Mahatma Gandhi, Eleanor Roosevelt, U Thant, V\u00e1clav Havel, Ken Saro-Wiwa, Fazle Hasan Abed and Corazon Aquino as people who \"never won the prize, but should have\".The omission of Mahatma Gandhi has been particularly widely discussed, including in public statements by various members of the Nobel Committee. The committee has confirmed that Gandhi was nominated in 1937, 1938, 1939, 1947, and, finally, a few days before his assassination in January 1948. The omission has been publicly regretted by later members of the Nobel Committee. Geir Lundestad, Secretary of Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2006 said, \"The greatest omission in our 106-year history is undoubtedly that Mahatma Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace Prize. Gandhi could do without the Nobel Peace prize, whether Nobel committee can do without Gandhi is the question\". In 1948, following Gandhi's death, the Nobel Committee declined to award a prize on the ground that \"there was no suitable living candidate\" that year. Later, when the Dalai Lama was awarded the Peace Prize in 1989, the chairman of the committee said that this was \"in part a tribute to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi\".\n\n\n== List of Nobel Peace Prize laureates ==\n\nAs of November 2020, the Peace Prize has been awarded to 107 individuals and 28 organizations. 17 women have won the Nobel Peace Prize, more than any other Nobel Prize. Only two recipients have won multiple Prizes: the International Committee of the Red Cross has won three times (1917, 1944, and 1963) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has won twice (1954 and 1981).

Since March 1901, it has been awarded annually (with some exceptions) to those who have \"done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses\".In accordance with Alfred Nobel's will, the recipient is selected by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, a five-member committee appointed by the Parliament of Norway. Since 2020 the prize is awarded in the Atrium of the University of Oslo, where it was also awarded 1947\u20131989; the Abel Prize is also awarded in the building. The prize was previously awarded in Oslo City Hall (1990\u20132019), the Norwegian Nobel Institute (1905\u20131946), and the Parliament (1901\u20131904).\nDue to its political nature, the Nobel Peace Prize has, for most of its history, been the subject of numerous controversies. The most recent prize for 2021 was awarded to Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov.\n\n"}, "Ballistite": {"links": ["Court of Appeal", "High explosive", "Patent infringement", "Sanremo", "House of Lords", "Guncotton", "Nitrocellulose", "Paul Vieille", "Poudre B", "Diphenylamine", "Petroleum jelly", "James Dewar", "Frederick Augustus Abel", "Smokeless powder", "Avigliana", "Acetone", "Black powder", "Cordite", "Alfred Nobel", "Nitroglycerin", "Collodion", "Camphor", "Great power"], "content": "Ballistite is a smokeless propellant made from two high explosives, nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. It was developed and patented by Alfred Nobel in the late 19th century.\n\n\n== Military adoption ==\nAlfred Nobel patented Ballistite in 1887 while he was living in Paris.  His formulation was composed of 10% camphor and equal parts nitroglycerine and collodion. The camphor reacted with any acidic products of the chemical breakdown of the two explosives. This both stabilized the explosive against further decomposition and prevented spontaneous explosions. However, camphor tends to evaporate over time, leaving a potentially unstable mixture.Nobel's patent specified that the nitrocellulose should be \"of the well-known soluble kind\". He offered to sell the rights of the new explosive to the French government, but they declined, largely because they had just adopted Poudre B for military use. He subsequently licensed the rights to the Italian government, who entered into a contract, on 1 August 1889, to obtain 300,000 kilograms of Ballistite; and Nobel opened a factory at Avigliana, Turin.The Italian Army swiftly replaced their M1870 and M1870/87 rifles, which used black powder cartridges, to a new model, the M1890 Vetterli, which used a cartridge loaded with ballistite.\nAs Italy was a competing great power to France, this was not received well by the French press and the public. The newspapers accused Nobel of industrial espionage, by spying on Paul Vieille (the inventor of Poudre B), and \"high treason against France\". Following a police investigation, he was refused permission to conduct any more research, or to manufacture explosives in France. He therefore moved to San Remo in Italy, in 1891, where he spent the last five years of his life.Ballistite is still manufactured as a solid fuel rocket propellant, although the less volatile but chemically similar diphenylamine is used instead of camphor.\n\n\n== Development of cordite and unsuccessful claim by Nobel of patent infringement ==\nMeanwhile, a government committee in Great Britain, called the \"Explosives Committee\" and chaired by Sir Frederick Abel, monitored foreign developments in explosives. Abel and Sir James Dewar, who was also on the committee, jointly patented a modified form of ballistite in 1889. This consisted of 58% nitroglycerin by weight, 37% guncotton and 5% petroleum jelly. Using acetone as a solvent, it was extruded as spaghetti-like rods initially called \"cord powder\" or \"the committee's modification of ballistite\", but this was soon abbreviated to cordite.\nAfter unsuccessful negotiations, in 1893, Nobel sued Abel and Dewar over patent infringement and lost the case. It then went to the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords in 1895 where he also lost the two appeals and the Nobel's Explosives Company had to pay the costs. The claim was lost because the words \"of the well-known soluble kind\" in his patent were taken to mean soluble collodion, and to specifically exclude the ether-alcohol-insoluble guncotton.\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\nSources", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg"], "summary": "Ballistite is a smokeless propellant made from two high explosives, nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine.

Founded in Roman times, it has a population of 55,000, and is known as a tourist destination on the Italian Riviera.  It hosts numerous cultural events, such as the Sanremo Music Festival and the Milan\u2013San Remo cycling classic.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name of the city is a phonetic contraction of Sant'Eremo di San Romolo, which refers to Romulus of Genoa, the successor to Syrus of Genoa. It is often stated in modern folk stories that Sanremo is a translation of \"Saint Remus\", a deceased Saint. In Ligurian, his name is San R\u0153mu. The spelling San Remo is on all ancient maps of Liguria, the ancient Republic of Genoa, Italy in the Middle Ages, the Kingdom of Sardinia, and the Kingdom of Italy. It was used in 1924 in official documents under Mussolini. This form of the name appears still on some road signs and, more rarely, in unofficial tourist information. It has been the most widely used form of the name in English at least since the 19th century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nOnce the Roman settlement of Matutia or Villa Matutiana, Sanremo expanded in the Early Middle Ages when the population moved to the high grounds.  The nobility built a castle and the walled village of La Pigna to protect the town from Saracen raids.\nAt first subjected to the countship of Ventimiglia, the community later passed under the dominion of the Genoese bishops.  In 1297 they sold it to the Doria and De Mari families. It became a free town in the second half of the 15th century, after which it expanded to the Pigna hill and at Saint Syrus Cathedral. The almost perfectly preserved old village remains.\nSanremo remained independent of the Genoese Republic.  In 1753, after 20 years of fierce conflicts, it rose against Genoese hegemonical attempts. At that time Genoa built the fortress of Santa Tecla, situated on the beach near the port. The fortress was used as a prison until 2002.  It is now used as a museum.\nAfter the French domination and the Savoy restoration in 1814, Sanremo was annexed to the Kingdom of Sardinia. From the middle of the 18th century the town grew rapidly, in part due to the development of tourism, which saw the first grand hotels built and the town extended along the coast. The Empress \"Sissi\" of Austria, Empress Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, and Emperor Nicholas II of Russia vacationed in Sanremo, while Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel made it his permanent home.\nThe San Remo conference, 19\u201326 April 1920, of the post-World War I Allied Supreme Council determined the allocation of Class \"A\" League of Nations mandates for administration of the former Ottoman-ruled lands of the Middle East by the victorious powers.  The most notable of these was the British Mandate of Palestine.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nSanremo's Mediterranean climate and attractive seacoast setting on the Italian Riviera make it a popular tourist destination. Besides tourism, the city is active in the production of extra virgin-grade olive oil, whose regional \"designation of origin\" is protected (D.O.P., Denominazione di Origine Protetta).  It is one of the agricultural commodities in western Liguria and in particular within the province of Imperia. Sanremo is known as the City of Flowers (la Citt\u00e0 dei Fiori), this being another important aspect of the economy of the city. The nearby towns of Arma di Taggia, Bordighera and Ospedaletti are also involved in the cultivation of flowers for the international flower market of Sanremo.\nThe Municipal Casino, built in 1905, is an example of Art Nouveau building. The Ariston Theatre offers annual series of concerts, operas and theatre plays. The Symphony Orchestra is one of twelve symphony orchestras recognized by the state of Italy; it performs some 120 concerts throughout the year, most in the Municipal Casino's Opera Theatre.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nThe city is connected to Genoa and to Ventimiglia, the border city with France, by the A10 motorway, whose last part is also known as the Autostrada dei Fiori (\"Motorway of Flowers\"). It has a large number of elevated sections with viaducts that give a panoramic view of the coast. The A10 joins the French A8 highway at the border between Ventimiglia and Menton. Together these national routes are part of the European route E80. The A10 motorway is a toll road, and the A8 demands a toll in sections, and some sections are free of charge.  When travelling from Italy into France, one does not pay until after the towns of Menton and Monaco.\nOther roads of importance are the SS1, the \"Aurelia Bis\", which connects Sanremo to Taggia. This is a non-toll bypass route. The coast road is the via Aurelia or SS1 and follows the route of a Roman road. This can be heavily congested when it passes through towns, as it has only one lane in either direction for most of way around Sanremo.  A trolleybus line along the via Aurelia links Sanremo with both Taggia and Ventimiglia.\nThe closest airport to Sanremo is in France, the C\u00f4te d'Azur International Airport in Nice, 45 minutes away by car. The railway connects the city to the other Ligurian cities like Imperia, Genoa and to Nice, Milan, Turin and Rome.\nThe railway line used to be along the coast, running close to the sea, and providing a view for travellers.  The line has been moved further north and underground, which allows for faster trains; Sanremo railway station was relocated next to the City Hall. The city has refurbished the old railway line and converted it into a bike route and pedestrian area. There are several bike hire kiosks along the route and a choice of beaches to visit in either direction from San Remo. The path stretches 24 km (15 mi) between Ospedaletti in the west and San Lorenzo al Mare in the east.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nSanremo experiences a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa).\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Music festival ===\nThe Ariston Theatre hosts the celebrated annual Sanremo Music Festival, a very popular song contest held in the city since 1951. This festival inspired the Eurovision Song Contest, which started in 1956, and for years the Sanremo festival selected the Italian entry. The internationally notable song Nel blu dipinto di blu, also known as Volare, was performed at this festival for the first time by Domenico Modugno in 1958. The festival is so popular among Italians that it is often referred to simply as \"Il Festival\" (The Festival). Other events include the Tenco Prize (autumn), a song contest for authors dedicated to the memory of Luigi Tenco; the Flowers Parade in January/February in which every city of the Italian Riviera presents an original composition of flowers displayed on a Carnival/Mardi-Gras style moving car; and the summer Firework International Contest in the second week of August also called Ferragosto.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nThe culinary specialities of Sanremo and environs include Sardenara, Focaccia, Focaccia alle Cipolle, Torta Verde, Farinata and Taggiasca olives.\n\n\n=== Gambling ===\nThe Sanremo Casino (Casino Municipale di Sanremo) opened in 1905 and has operated continuously since then with the exception of the years of World War II.  For much of its history, the casino was tolerated or granted exceptions to Italian gambling laws in order to allow the resort to compete with the casino towns in nearby France and Monaco.  \nSanremo hosts an annual poker tournament as part of the European Poker Tour. The city is widely accepted as the origin of the five-card stud variant telesina.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe Rallye Sanremo is a rally competition that was part of the FIA World Rally Championship from 1973 to 2003, when it was replaced by Rally d'Italia Sardegna on the island of Sardinia, in hosting the Italian round of the WRC. It is now part of European Rally Championship. Formerly a mixed surface event (tarmac and gravel), the rally has later been an all-tarmac event and takes place around the mountains.\nSanremo is the finish of the classic Milan\u2013San Remo cycle race. It is considered to be a \"monument\" - one of the five most important one-day races of the cycling season. Milan \u2013 San Remo is traditionally held in March and is one of the first major fixtures on the cycling season. At 298 kilometres (185 mi) long, it is the longest professional one-day race in cycling, giving the race a unique character.\nThe famous local football club is the Sanremese that has played also in Serie B and in Serie C.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nMercurial Italian tennis player Fabio Fognini.\nThe Venerable Giorgio Baldassarre Oppezzi, a monk who died in 1525, and whose body was later discovered to be incorrupt, is buried here in the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli.\nItalian singer Luigi Tenco died in Sanremo shortly after his performance at the 1967 Italian Song Festival.\nEmpress Maria Alexandrovna, consort of Alexander II of Russia, spent the winter of 1874 in Sanremo and as a gift to the city she donated the palms along the seaside walk of Corso Imperatrice (Empress Avenue).\nAlfred Nobel bought a villa in Sanremo in 1891 and died there in 1896. Since 2002 it has housed a permanent exhibit on the most important discoveries of the 19th century including the research interests of Nobel himself. Sanremo continues to maintain its ties with Nobel, long after his death. Each 10 December (the date that Nobel died in 1896) large quantities of flowers sent by the province of Imperia, the city of Sanremo and the Board for Tourist Promotion of the Riviera dei fiori adorn the annual Nobel Prize Award Ceremony and Banquet in Stockholm.\nItalian writer Italo Calvino spent his youth in Sanremo and many of his novels, including Il Barone Rampante, are reminiscent of his attachment to the city.\nEdward James, British poet known for his patronage of the surrealist art movement, died in Sanremo on December 2, 1984.\nEdward Lear, English artist, illustrator and writer known for his nonsense poetry and limericks, lived and died in Sanremo. His tombstone is in the Foce Cemetery.\nThe Italian actor and comedian Carlo Dapporto was born in Sanremo and became a household name in post-war Italy.\nThe Sicilian playwright and Nobel Prize winner Luigi Pirandello lived in Sanremo in 1933-34 and was appointed artistic director of the Casino.\nThe writer Tobias Smollett stayed a few days in Sanremo in 1765 and described it thus: \"St. Remo is a pretty considerable town, well-built upon the declivity of a gently rolling hill...There is very little plain ground in this neighbourhood; but the hills are covered with oranges, lemons, pomegranates and olives....The women of St. Remo are much more handsome and better tempered than those of Provence.\" Travels through France and Italy (1766)\nItalian director and cinematographer Mario Bava was born in Sanremo in 1914.\nItalian-born sculptor Giuseppe Moretti lived in Sanremo in his final years and died here in February 1935.  Moretti designed the world's largest cast iron statue, of the Roman god Vulcan (56 ft or 17 m), which stands atop Red Mountain in Birmingham, Alabama (USA).  The statue is the symbol of the city.\nItalian progressive-impressionist painter Demetrio (Dino) Rosa lived in Sanremo during his youth and part of his adult life.\nMehmed VI, the last Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, died in Sanremo on May 16, 1926.\nFausto Zonaro, last Court Painter to the Ottoman Empire, died in San Remo on the 19th of July 1929. He was buried with public honours in La Foce cemetery. On his gravestone, underneath an Ottoman tughra, it states that Zonaro was the court painter of the Ottoman Empire.\nJuan Manuel Fangio won his first European Grand Prix in Sanremo-Ospedaletti in 1949.\nMohammad Ali Shah Qajar, Shah of Persia from 1907 to 1909, died in Sanremo on April 5, 1925.\nAlex Liddi, who was born in Sanremo, became the first native Italian to play Major League Baseball, in 2011 with the Seattle Mariners.\nGiovanni Ermiglia, Italian nonviolent activist.\nGiotto Maraghini, Italian admiral (1882-1946).\n\n\n== Twin towns \u2013 sister cities ==\n\nSanremo is twinned with:\n Atami, Japan (1976)\n Helsing\u00f8r, Denmark\n Karlskoga, Sweden\n\n\n== See also ==\nSanremo railway station\nSanremo railway station (1872)\nU.S. Sanremese Calcio\nSanremo Festival\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n(in Italian) Sanremo official website\n(in Italian) Sanremo Festival\n(in Italian) Saint Sirus's Cathedral\n(in Italian) Video and events from Sanremo\n(in Italian) New Sanremo cycle path\n(in Italian) Sanremo images - old port and sanctuary\n(in English) All about the events in Sanremo", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Collage_sanremo.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Finishing_line_2017_Milan-Sanremo.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Flag_of_Denmark.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/Italy_Liguria_location_map.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Italy_provincial_location_map_2016.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Poster_Funivia_Sanremo_Monte_Bignone_1937.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0c/Red_pog.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Sanremo%2C_casin%C3%B2%2C_01.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Sanremo_poster_1920.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Wikivoyage-Logo-v3-icon.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9e/Flag_of_Japan.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4c/Flag_of_Sweden.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8b/Sanremo-Stemma.png"], "summary": "Sanremo (Italian: [san\u02c8r\u025b\u02d0mo]; Ligurian: Sanr\u00e9mmo(ro) or Sanreumo(ro), pronounced [sa\u014b\u02c8\u027e\u00f8\u02d0mu(\u0279u)]) or San Remo is a city and comune on the Mediterranean coast of Liguria, in northwestern Italy.
