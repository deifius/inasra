In the Keynesian view, aggregate demand does not necessarily equal the productive capacity of the economy. Instead, it is influenced by a host of factors \u2013 sometimes behaving erratically \u2013 affecting production, employment, and inflation.Keynesian economists generally argue that aggregate demand is volatile and unstable and that, consequently, a market economy often experiences inefficient macroeconomic outcomes \u2013 a recession, when demand is low, and inflation, when demand is high. Further, they argue that these economic fluctuations can be mitigated by economic policy responses coordinated between government and central bank. In particular, fiscal policy actions (taken by the government) and  monetary policy actions (taken by the central bank), can help stabilize economic output, inflation, and unemployment over the business cycle. Keynesian economists generally advocate a market economy \u2013 predominantly private sector, but with an active role for government intervention during recessions and depressions.Keynesian economics developed during and after the Great Depression from the ideas presented by Keynes in his 1936 book, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. Keynes' approach was a stark contrast to the aggregate supply-focused classical economics that preceded his book. Interpreting Keynes's work is a contentious topic, and several schools of economic thought claim his legacy.\nKeynesian economics, as part of the neoclassical synthesis, served as the standard macroeconomic model in the developed nations during the later part of the Great Depression, World War II, and the post-war economic expansion (1945\u20131973). It lost some influence following the oil shock and resulting stagflation of the 1970s. Keynesian economics was later redeveloped as New Keynesian economics, becoming part of the contemporary new neoclassical synthesis, that forms one current-day theory on  macroeconomics. The advent of the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 sparked renewed interest in Keynesian thought.\n\n\n== Historical context ==\n\n\n=== Pre-Keynesian macroeconomics ===\nMacroeconomics is the study of the factors applying to an economy as a whole. Important macroeconomic variables include the overall price level, the interest rate, the level of employment, and income (or equivalently output) measured in real terms.\nThe classical tradition of partial equilibrium theory had been to split the economy into separate markets, each of whose equilibrium conditions could be stated as a single equation determining a single variable. The theoretical apparatus of supply and demand curves developed by Fleeming Jenkin and Alfred Marshall provided a unified mathematical basis for this approach, which the Lausanne School generalized to general equilibrium theory.\nFor macroeconomics, relevant partial theories included the Quantity theory of money determining the price level and the classical theory of the interest rate. In regards to employment, the condition referred to by Keynes as the \"first postulate of classical economics\" stated that the wage is equal to the marginal product, which is a direct application of the marginalist principles developed during the nineteenth century (see The General Theory). Keynes sought to supplant all three aspects of the classical theory.\n\n\n=== Precursors of Keynesianism ===\n\nAlthough Keynes's work was crystallized and given impetus by the advent of the Great Depression, it was part of a long-running debate within economics over the existence and nature of general gluts. A number of the policies Keynes advocated to address the Great Depression (notably government deficit spending at times of low private investment or consumption), and many of the theoretical ideas he proposed (effective demand, the multiplier, the paradox of thrift), had been advanced by various authors in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Keynes's unique contribution was to provide a general theory of these, which proved acceptable to the economic establishment.\nAn intellectual precursor of Keynesian economics was underconsumption theories associated with John Law, Thomas Malthus, the Birmingham School of Thomas Attwood, and the American economists William Trufant Foster and Waddill Catchings, who were influential in the 1920s and 1930s. Underconsumptionists were, like Keynes after them, concerned with failure of aggregate demand to attain potential output, calling this \"underconsumption\" (focusing on the demand side), rather than \"overproduction\" (which would focus on the supply side), and advocating economic interventionism. Keynes specifically discussed underconsumption (which he wrote \"under-consumption\") in the General Theory, in Chapter 22, Section IV and Chapter 23, Section VII.\nNumerous concepts were developed earlier and independently of Keynes by the Stockholm school during the 1930s; these accomplishments were described in a 1937 article, published in response to the 1936 General Theory, sharing the Swedish discoveries.The paradox of thrift was stated in 1892 by John M. Robertson in his The Fallacy of Saving, in earlier forms by mercantilist economists since the 16th century, and similar sentiments date to antiquity.\n\n\n=== Keynes's early writings ===\nIn 1923 Keynes published his first contribution to economic theory, A Tract on Monetary Reform, whose point of view is classical but incorporates ideas that later played a part in the General Theory.  In particular, looking at the hyperinflation in European economies, he drew attention to the opportunity cost of holding money (identified with inflation rather than interest) and its influence on the velocity of circulation.In 1930 he published A Treatise on Money, intended as a comprehensive treatment of its subject \"which would confirm his stature as a serious academic scholar, rather than just as the author of stinging polemics\", and marks a large step in the direction of his later views. In it, he attributes unemployment to wage stickiness and treats saving and investment as governed by independent decisions: the former varying positively with the interest rate, the latter negatively. The velocity of circulation is expressed as a function of the rate of interest. He interpreted his treatment of liquidity as implying a purely monetary theory of interest.Keynes's younger colleagues of the Cambridge Circus and Ralph Hawtrey believed that his arguments implicitly assumed full employment, and this influenced the direction of his subsequent work. During 1933, he wrote essays on various economic topics \"all of which are cast in terms of movement of output as a whole\".\n\n\n=== Development of The General Theory ===\nAt the time that Keynes's wrote the General Theory, it had been a tenet of mainstream economic thought that the economy would automatically revert to a state of general equilibrium: it had been assumed that, because the needs of consumers are always greater than the capacity of the producers to satisfy those needs, everything that is produced would eventually be consumed once the appropriate price was found for it. This perception is reflected in Say's law and in the writing of David Ricardo, which states that individuals produce so that they can either consume what they have manufactured or sell their output so that they can buy someone else's output. This argument rests upon the assumption that if a surplus of goods or services exists, they would naturally drop in price to the point where they would be consumed.\nGiven the backdrop of high and persistent unemployment during the Great Depression, Keynes argued that there was no guarantee that the goods that individuals produce would be met with adequate effective demand, and periods of high unemployment could be expected, especially when the economy was contracting in size. He saw the economy as unable to maintain itself at full employment automatically, and believed that it was necessary for the government to step in and put purchasing power into the hands of the working population through government spending. Thus, according to Keynesian theory, some individually rational microeconomic-level actions such as not investing savings in the goods and services produced by the economy, if taken collectively by a large proportion of individuals and firms, can lead to outcomes wherein the economy operates below its potential output and growth rate.\nPrior to Keynes, a situation in which aggregate demand for goods and services did not meet supply was referred to by classical economists as a general glut, although there was disagreement among them as to whether a general glut was possible.  Keynes argued that when a glut occurred, it was the over-reaction of producers and the laying off of workers that led to a fall in demand and perpetuated the problem. Keynesians therefore advocate an active stabilization policy to reduce the amplitude of the business cycle, which they rank among the most serious of economic problems. According to the theory, government spending can be used to increase aggregate demand, thus increasing economic activity, reducing unemployment and deflation.\n\n\n=== Origins of the multiplier ===\nThe Liberal Party fought the 1929 General Election on a promise to \"reduce levels of unemployment to normal within one year by utilising the stagnant labour force in vast schemes of national development\". David Lloyd George launched his campaign in March with a policy document, We can cure unemployment, which tentatively claimed that, \"Public works would lead to a second round of spending as the workers spent their wages.\" Two months later Keynes, then nearing completion of his Treatise on money, and Hubert Henderson collaborated on a political pamphlet seeking to \"provide academically respectable economic arguments\" for Lloyd George's policies. It was titled Can Lloyd George do it? and endorsed the claim that \"greater trade activity would make for greater trade activity ... with a cumulative effect\". This became the mechanism of the \"ratio\" published by Richard Kahn in his 1931 paper \"The relation of home investment to unemployment\", described by Alvin Hansen as \"one of the great landmarks of economic analysis\". The \"ratio\" was soon rechristened the \"multiplier\" at Keynes's suggestion.The multiplier of Kahn's paper is based on a respending mechanism familiar nowadays from textbooks. Samuelson puts it as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that I hire unemployed resources to build a $1000 woodshed. My carpenters and lumber producers will get an extra $1000 of income... If they all have a marginal propensity to consume of 2/3, they will now spend $666.67 on new consumption goods. The producers of these goods will now have extra incomes... they in turn will spend $444.44 ... Thus an endless chain of secondary consumption respending\u202f is set in motion by my primary\u202f investment of $1000.\nSamuelson's treatment closely follows Joan Robinson's account of 1937 and is the main channel by which the multiplier has influenced Keynesian theory. It differs significantly from Kahn's paper and even more from Keynes's book.\nThe designation of the initial spending as \"investment\" and the employment-creating respending as \"consumption\" echoes Kahn faithfully, though he gives no reason why initial consumption or subsequent investment respending shouldn't have exactly the same effects. Henry Hazlitt, who considered Keynes as much a culprit as Kahn and Samuelson, wrote that ...\n\n... in connection with the multiplier (and indeed most of the time) what Keynes is referring to as \"investment\" really means any addition to spending for any purpose...  The word \"investment\" is being used in a Pickwickian, or Keynesian, sense.\nKahn envisaged money as being passed from hand to hand, creating employment at each step, until it came to rest in a cul-de-sac\u202f (Hansen's term was \"leakage\"); the only culs-de-sac\u202f he acknowledged were imports and hoarding, although he also said that a rise in prices might dilute the multiplier effect. Jens Warming recognised that personal saving had to be considered, treating it as a \"leakage\" (p. 214) while recognising on p. 217 that it might in fact be invested.\nThe textbook multiplier gives the impression that making society richer is the easiest thing in the world: the government just needs to spend more. In Kahn's paper, it is harder. For him, the initial expenditure must not be a diversion of funds from other uses, but an increase in the total expenditure: something impossible \u2013 if understood in real terms \u2013 under the classical theory that the level of expenditure is limited by the economy's income/output. On page 174, Kahn rejects the claim that the effect of public works is at the expense of expenditure elsewhere, admitting that this might arise if the revenue is raised by taxation, but says that other available means have no such consequences. As an example, he suggests that the money may be raised by borrowing from banks, since ...\n\n... it is always within the power of the banking system to advance to the Government the cost of the roads without in any way affecting the flow of investment along the normal channels.\nThis assumes that banks are free to create resources to answer any demand. But Kahn adds that ...\n\n... no such hypothesis is really necessary. For it will be demonstrated later on that, pari passu\u202f with the building of roads, funds are released from various sources at precisely the rate that is required to pay the cost of the roads.\nThe demonstration relies on \"Mr Meade's relation\" (due to James Meade) asserting that the total amount of money that disappears into culs-de-sac\u202f is equal to the original outlay, which in Kahn's words \"should bring relief and consolation to those who are worried about the monetary sources\" (p. 189).\nA respending multiplier had been proposed earlier by Hawtrey in a 1928 Treasury memorandum (\"with imports as the only leakage\"), but the idea was discarded in his own subsequent writings. Soon afterwards the Australian economist Lyndhurst Giblin published a multiplier analysis in a 1930 lecture (again with imports as the only leakage). The idea itself was much older. Some Dutch mercantilists had believed in an infinite multiplier for military expenditure (assuming no import \"leakage\"), since ...\n\n... a war could support itself for an unlimited period if only money remained in the country ... For if money itself is \"consumed\", this simply means that it passes into someone else's possession, and this process may continue indefinitely. Multiplier doctrines had subsequently been expressed in more theoretical terms by the Dane Julius Wulff (1896), the Australian Alfred de Lissa (late 1890s), the German/American Nicholas Johannsen (same period), and the Dane Fr. Johannsen (1925/1927). Kahn himself said that the idea was given to him as a child by his father.\n\n\n=== Public policy debates ===\nAs the 1929 election approached \"Keynes was becoming a strong public advocate of capital development\" as a public measure to alleviate unemployment. Winston Churchill, the Conservative Chancellor, took the opposite view:\n\nIt is the orthodox Treasury dogma, steadfastly held ... [that] very little additional employment and no permanent additional employment can, in fact, be created by State borrowing and State expenditure.\nKeynes pounced on a flaw in the Treasury view. Cross-examining Sir Richard Hopkins, a Second Secretary in the Treasury, before the Macmillan Committee on Finance and Industry in 1930 he referred to the \"first proposition\" that \"schemes of capital development are of no use for reducing unemployment\" and asked whether \"it would be a misunderstanding of the Treasury view to say that they hold to the first proposition\". Hopkins responded that \"The first proposition goes much too far. The first proposition would ascribe to us an absolute and rigid dogma, would it not?\"Later the same year, speaking in a newly created Committee of Economists, Keynes tried to use Kahn's emerging multiplier theory to argue for public works, \"but Pigou's and Henderson's objections ensured that there was no sign of this in the final product\". In 1933 he gave wider publicity to his support for Kahn's multiplier in a series of articles titled \"The road to prosperity\" in The Times newspaper.A. C. Pigou was at the time the sole economics professor at Cambridge. He had a continuing interest in the subject of unemployment, having expressed the view in his popular Unemployment\u202f (1913) that it was caused by \"maladjustment between wage-rates and demand\" \u2013 a view Keynes may have shared prior to the years of the General Theory. Nor were his practical recommendations very different: \"on many occasions in the thirties\" Pigou \"gave public support ... to State action designed to stimulate employment\". Where the two men differed is in the link between theory and practice. Keynes was seeking to build theoretical foundations to support his recommendations for public works while Pigou showed no disposition to move away from classical doctrine. Referring to him and Dennis Robertson, Keynes asked rhetorically: \"Why do they insist on maintaining theories from which their own practical conclusions cannot possibly follow?\"\n\n\n== The General Theory ==\n\nKeynes set forward the ideas that became the basis for Keynesian economics in his main work, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936). It was written during the Great Depression, when unemployment rose to 25% in the United States and as high as 33% in some countries. It is almost wholly theoretical, enlivened by occasional passages of satire and social commentary. The book had a profound impact on economic thought, and ever since it was published there has been debate over its meaning.\n\n\n=== Keynes and classical economics ===\nKeynes begins the General Theory\u202f with a summary of the classical theory of employment, which he encapsulates in his formulation of Say's Law as the dictum \"Supply creates its own demand\".\nUnder the classical theory, the wage rate is determined by the marginal productivity of labour, and as many people are employed as are willing to work at that rate. Unemployment may arise through friction or may be \"voluntary,\" in the sense that it arises from a refusal to accept employment owing to \"legislation or social practices ... or mere human obstinacy\", but \"...the classical postulates do not admit of the possibility of the third category,\" which Keynes defines as involuntary unemployment.Keynes raises two objections to the classical theory's assumption that \"wage bargains ... determine the real wage\". The first lies in the fact that \"labour stipulates (within limits) for a money-wage rather than a real wage\". The second is that classical theory assumes that, \"The real wages of labour depend on the wage bargains which labour makes with the entrepreneurs,\" whereas, \"If money wages change, one would have expected the classical school to argue that prices would change in almost the same proportion, leaving the real wage and the level of unemployment practically the same as before.\" Keynes considers his second objection the more fundamental, but most commentators concentrate on his first one: it has been argued that the quantity theory of money protects the classical school from the conclusion Keynes expected from it.\n\n\n=== Keynesian unemployment ===\n\n\n==== Saving and investment ====\nSaving is that part of income not devoted to consumption, and consumption is that part of expenditure not allocated to investment, i.e., to durable goods. Hence saving encompasses hoarding (the accumulation of income as cash) and the purchase of durable goods. The existence of net hoarding, or of a demand to hoard, is not admitted by the simplified liquidity preference model of the General Theory.\nOnce he rejects the classical theory that unemployment is due to excessive wages, Keynes proposes an alternative based on the relationship between saving and investment. In his view, unemployment arises whenever entrepreneurs' incentive to invest fails to keep pace with society's propensity to save (propensity is one of Keynes's synonyms for \"demand\"). The levels of saving and investment are necessarily equal, and income is therefore held down to a level where the desire to save is no greater than the incentive to invest.\nThe incentive to invest arises from the interplay between the physical circumstances of production and psychological anticipations of future profitability; but once these things are given the incentive is independent of income and depends solely on the rate of interest r. Keynes designates its value as a function of r\u202f as the \"schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital\".The propensity to save behaves quite differently. Saving is simply that part of income not devoted to consumption, and:\n\n... the prevailing psychological law seems to be that when aggregate income increases, consumption expenditure will also increase but to a somewhat lesser extent.\nKeynes adds that \"this psychological law was of the utmost importance in the development of my own thought\".\n\n\n==== Liquidity preference ====\n\nKeynes viewed the money supply as one of the main determinants of the state of the real economy. The significance he attributed to it is one of the innovative features of his work, and was influential on the politically hostile monetarist school.\nMoney supply comes into play through the liquidity preference function, which is the demand function that corresponds to money supply. It specifies the amount of money people will seek to hold according to the state of the economy. In Keynes's first (and simplest) account \u2013 that of Chapter 13 \u2013 liquidity preference is determined solely by the interest rate r\u2014which is seen as the earnings forgone by holding wealth in liquid form: hence liquidity preference can be written L(r ) and in equilibrium must equal the externally fixed money supply M\u0302.\n\n\n==== Keynes\u2019s economic model ====\nMoney supply, saving and investment combine to determine the level of income as illustrated in the diagram, where the top graph shows money supply (on the vertical axis) against interest rate. M\u0302\u202f determines the ruling interest rate r\u0302\u202f through the liquidity preference function. The rate of interest determines the level of investment \u00ce\u202f through the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital, shown as a blue curve in the lower graph. The red curves in the same diagram show what the propensities to save are for different incomes Y\u202f; and the income \u0176\u202f corresponding to the equilibrium state of the economy must be the one for which the implied level of saving at the established interest rate is equal to \u00ce.\nIn Keynes's more complicated liquidity preference theory (presented in Chapter 15) the demand for money depends on income as well as on the interest rate and the analysis becomes more complicated. Keynes never fully integrated his second liquidity preference doctrine with the rest of his theory, leaving that to John Hicks: see the IS-LM model below.\n\n\n==== Wage rigidity ====\nKeynes rejects the classical explanation of unemployment based on wage rigidity, but it is not clear what effect the wage rate has on unemployment in his system. He treats wages of all workers as proportional to a single rate set by collective bargaining, and chooses his units so that this rate never appears separately in his discussion. It is present implicitly in those quantities he expresses in wage units, while being absent from those he expresses in money terms. It is therefore difficult to see whether, and in what way, his results differ for a different wage rate, nor is it clear what he thought about the matter.\n\n\n=== Remedies for unemployment ===\n\n\n==== Monetary remedies ====\nAn increase in the money supply, according to Keynes's theory, leads to a drop in the interest rate and an increase in the amount of investment that can be undertaken profitably, bringing with it an increase in total income.\n\n\n==== Fiscal remedies ====\nKeynes' name is associated with fiscal, rather than monetary, measures but they receive only passing (and often satirical) reference in the General Theory. He mentions \"increased public works\" as an example of something that brings employment through the multiplier, but this is before he develops the relevant theory, and he does not follow up when he gets to the theory.\nLater in the same chapter he tells us that:\n\nAncient Egypt was doubly fortunate, and doubtless owed to this its fabled wealth, in that it possessed two activities, namely, pyramid-building as well as the search for the precious metals, the fruits of which, since they could not serve the needs of man by being consumed, did not stale with abundance. The Middle Ages built cathedrals and sang dirges. Two pyramids, two masses for the dead, are twice as good as one; but not so two railways from London to York.\nBut again, he doesn't get back to his implied recommendation to engage in public works, even if not fully justified from their direct benefits, when he constructs the theory. On the contrary he later advises us that ...\n\n... our final task might be to select those variables which can be deliberately controlled or managed by central authority in the kind of system in which we actually live ...\nand this appears to look forward to a future publication rather than to a subsequent chapter of the General Theory.\n\n\n== Keynesian models and concepts ==\n\n\n=== Aggregate demand ===\n\nKeynes' view of saving and investment was his most important departure from the classical outlook. It can be illustrated using the \"Keynesian cross\" devised by Paul Samuelson. The horizontal axis denotes total income and the purple curve shows C\u202f(Y\u202f), the propensity to consume, whose complement S\u202f(Y\u202f) is the propensity to save: the sum of these two functions is equal to total income, which is shown by the broken line at 45\u00b0.\nThe horizontal blue line I\u202f(r\u202f) is the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital whose value is independent of Y. The schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital is dependent on the interest rate, specifically the interest rate cost of a new investment. If the interest rate charged by the financial sector to the productive sector is below the marginal efficiency of capital at that level of technology and capital intensity then investment is positive and grows the lower the interest rate is, given the diminishing return of capital. If the interest rate is above the marginal efficiency of capital then investment is equal to zero. Keynes interprets this as the demand for investment and denotes the sum of demands for consumption and investment as \"aggregate demand\", plotted as a separate curve. Aggregate demand must equal total income, so equilibrium income must be determined by the point where the aggregate demand curve crosses the 45\u00b0 line. This is the same horizontal position as the intersection of I\u202f(r\u202f) with S\u202f(Y\u202f).\nThe equation I\u202f(r\u202f) = S\u202f(Y\u202f) had been accepted by the classics, who had viewed it as the condition of equilibrium between supply and demand for investment funds and as determining the interest rate (see the classical theory of interest). But insofar as they had had a concept of aggregate demand, they had seen the demand for investment as being given by S\u202f(Y\u202f), since for them saving was simply the indirect purchase of capital goods, with the result that aggregate demand was equal to total income as an identity rather than as an equilibrium condition. Keynes takes note of this view in Chapter 2, where he finds it present in the early writings of Alfred Marshall but adds that \"the doctrine is never stated to-day in this crude form\".\nThe equation I\u202f(r\u202f) = S\u202f(Y\u202f) is accepted by Keynes for some or all of the following reasons:\n\nAs a consequence of the principle of effective demand, which asserts that aggregate demand must equal total income (Chapter 3).\nAs a consequence of the identity of saving with investment (Chapter 6) together with the equilibrium assumption that these quantities are equal to their demands.\nIn agreement with the substance of the classical theory of the investment funds market, whose conclusion he considers the classics to have misinterpreted through circular reasoning (Chapter 14).\n\n\n=== The Keynesian multiplier ===\nKeynes introduces his discussion of the multiplier in Chapter 10 with a reference to Kahn's earlier paper (see below). He designates Kahn's multiplier the \"employment multiplier\" in distinction to his own \"investment multiplier\" and says that the two are only \"a little different\". Kahn's multiplier has consequently been understood by much of the Keynesian literature as playing a major role in Keynes's own theory, an interpretation encouraged by the difficulty of understanding Keynes's presentation. Kahn's multiplier gives the title (\"The multiplier model\") to the account of Keynesian theory in Samuelson's Economics\u202f and is almost as prominent in Alvin Hansen's Guide to Keynes\u202f and in Joan Robinson's Introduction to the Theory of Employment.\nKeynes states that there is ...\n\n... a confusion between the logical theory of the multiplier, which holds good continuously, without time-lag ... and the consequence of an expansion in the capital goods industries which take gradual effect, subject to a time-lag, and only after an interval ...\nand implies that he is adopting the former theory. And when the multiplier eventually emerges as a component of Keynes's theory (in Chapter 18) it turns out to be simply a measure of the change of one variable in response to a change in another. The schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital is identified as one of the independent variables of the economic system: \"What [it] tells us, is ... the point to which the output of new investment will be pushed ...\" The multiplier then gives \"the ratio ... between an increment of investment and the corresponding increment of aggregate income\".G. L. S. Shackle regarded Keynes' move away from Kahn's multiplier as ...\n\n... a retrograde step ... For when we look upon the Multiplier as an instantaneous functional relation ... we are merely using the word Multiplier to stand for an alternative way of looking at the marginal propensity to consume ...,\nwhich G. M. Ambrosi cites as an instance of \"a Keynesian commentator who would have liked Keynes to have written something less 'retrograde'\".The value Keynes assigns to his multiplier is the reciprocal of the marginal propensity to save: k\u202f = 1\u202f/\u202fS\u202f'(Y\u202f). This is the same as the formula for Kahn's mutliplier in a closed economy assuming that all saving (including the purchase of durable goods), and not just hoarding, constitutes leakage. Keynes gave his formula almost the status of a definition (it is put forward in advance of any explanation). His multiplier is indeed the value of \"the ratio ... between an increment of investment and the corresponding increment of aggregate income\" as Keynes derived it from his Chapter 13 model of liquidity preference, which implies that income must bear the entire effect of a change in investment. But under his Chapter 15 model a change in the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital has an effect shared between the interest rate and income in proportions depending on the partial derivatives of the liquidity preference function. Keynes did not investigate the question of whether his formula for multiplier needed revision.\n\n\n=== The liquidity trap ===\nThe liquidity trap is a phenomenon that may impede the effectiveness of monetary policies in reducing unemployment.\nEconomists generally think the rate of interest will not fall below a certain limit, often seen as zero or a slightly negative number. Keynes suggested that the limit might be appreciably greater than zero but did not attach much practical significance to it. The term \"liquidity trap\" was coined by Dennis Robertson in his comments on the General Theory, but it was John Hicks in \"Mr. Keynes and the Classics\" who recognised the significance of a slightly different concept.\nIf the economy is in a position such that the liquidity preference curve is almost vertical, as must happen as the lower limit on r\u202f is approached, then a change in the money supply M\u0302\u202f makes almost no difference to the equilibrium rate of interest r\u0302\u202f or, unless there is compensating steepness in the other curves, to the resulting income \u0176. As Hicks put it, \"Monetary means will not force down the rate of interest any further.\"\nPaul Krugman has worked extensively on the liquidity trap, claiming that it was the problem confronting the Japanese economy around the turn of the millennium. In his later words:\n\nShort-term interest rates were close to zero, long-term rates were at historical lows, yet private investment spending remained insufficient to bring the economy out of deflation. In that environment, monetary policy was just as ineffective as Keynes described. Attempts by the Bank of Japan to increase the money supply simply added to already ample bank reserves and public holdings of cash...\n\n\n==== The IS\u2013LM model ====\n\nHicks showed how to analyze Keynes' system when liquidity preference is a function of income as well as of the rate of interest. Keynes's admission of income as an influence on the demand for money is a step back in the direction of classical theory, and Hicks takes a further step in the same direction by generalizing the propensity to save to take both Y\u202f and r\u202f as arguments. Less classically he extends this generalization to the schedule of the marginal efficiency of capital.\nThe IS-LM model uses two equations to express Keynes' model. The first, now written I (Y, r )\u202f=\u202fS (Y,r ), expresses the principle of effective demand. We may construct a graph on (Y, r ) coordinates and draw a line connecting those points satisfying the equation: this is the IS\u202f curve. In the same way we can write the equation of equilibrium between liquidity preference and the money supply as L(Y\u202f,r\u202f)\u202f=\u202fM\u0302 and draw a second curve \u2013 the LM\u202f curve \u2013 connecting points that satisfy it. The equilibrium values \u0176\u202f of total income and r\u0302\u202f of interest rate are then given by the point of intersection of the two curves.\nIf we follow Keynes's initial account under which liquidity preference depends only on the interest rate r, then the LM\u202f curve is horizontal.\nJoan Robinson commented that:\n\n... modern teaching has been confused by J. R. Hicks' attempt to reduce the General Theory to a version of static equilibrium with the formula IS\u2013LM. Hicks has now repented and changed his name from J. R. to John, but it will take a long time for the effects of his teaching to wear off.\nHicks subsequently relapsed.\n\n\n== Keynesian economic policies ==\n\n\n=== Active fiscal policy ===\n\nKeynes argued that the solution to the Great Depression was to stimulate the country (\"incentive to invest\") through some combination of two approaches:\n\nA reduction in interest rates (monetary policy), and\nGovernment investment in infrastructure (fiscal policy).If the interest rate at which businesses and consumers can borrow decreases, investments that were previously uneconomic become profitable, and large consumer sales normally financed through debt (such as houses, automobiles, and, historically, even appliances like refrigerators) become more affordable. A principal function of central banks in countries that have them is to influence this interest rate through a variety of mechanisms collectively called monetary policy. This is how monetary policy that reduces interest rates is thought to stimulate economic activity, i.e., \"grow the economy\"\u2014and why it is called expansionary monetary policy.\nExpansionary fiscal policy consists of increasing net public spending, which the government can effect by a) taxing less, b) spending more, or c) both. Investment and consumption by government raises demand for businesses' products and for employment, reversing the effects of the aforementioned imbalance. If desired spending exceeds revenue, the government finances the difference by borrowing from capital markets by issuing government bonds. This is called deficit spending. Two points are important to note at this point. First, deficits are not required for expansionary fiscal policy, and second, it is only change in net spending that can stimulate or depress the economy. For example, if a government ran a deficit of 10% both last year and this year, this would represent neutral fiscal policy. In fact, if it ran a deficit of 10% last year and 5% this year, this would actually be contractionary. On the other hand, if the government ran a surplus of 10% of GDP last year and 5% this year, that would be expansionary fiscal policy, despite never running a deficit at all.\nBut \u2013 contrary to some critical characterizations of it \u2013 Keynesianism does not consist solely of deficit spending, since it recommends adjusting fiscal policies according to cyclical circumstances. An example of a counter-cyclical policy is raising taxes to cool the economy and to prevent inflation when there is abundant demand-side growth, and engaging in deficit spending on labour-intensive infrastructure projects to stimulate employment and stabilize wages during economic downturns.\nKeynes's ideas influenced Franklin D. Roosevelt's view that insufficient buying-power caused the Depression. During his presidency, Roosevelt adopted some aspects of Keynesian economics, especially after 1937, when, in the depths of the Depression, the United States suffered from recession yet again following fiscal contraction. But to many the true success of Keynesian policy can be seen at the onset of World War II, which provided a kick to the world economy, removed uncertainty, and forced the rebuilding of destroyed capital. Keynesian ideas became almost official in social-democratic Europe after the war and in the U.S. in the 1960s.\nThe Keynesian advocacy of deficit spending contrasted with the classical and neoclassical economic analysis of fiscal policy. They admitted that fiscal stimulus could actuate production. But, to these schools, there was no reason to believe that this stimulation would outrun the side-effects that \"crowd out\" private investment: first, it would increase the demand for labour and raise wages, hurting profitability; Second, a government deficit increases the stock of government bonds, reducing their market price and encouraging high interest rates, making it more expensive for business to finance fixed investment. Thus, efforts to stimulate the economy would be self-defeating.\nThe Keynesian response is that such fiscal policy is appropriate only when unemployment is persistently high, above the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU). In that case, crowding out is minimal. Further, private investment can be \"crowded in\": Fiscal stimulus raises the market for business output, raising cash flow and profitability, spurring business optimism. To Keynes, this accelerator effect meant that government and business could be complements rather than substitutes in this situation.\nSecond, as the stimulus occurs, gross domestic product rises\u2014raising the amount of saving, helping to finance the increase in fixed investment. Finally, government outlays need not always be wasteful: government investment in public goods that is not provided by profit-seekers encourages the private sector's growth. That is, government spending on such things as basic research, public health, education, and infrastructure could help the long-term growth of potential output.\nIn Keynes's theory, there must be significant slack in the labour market before fiscal expansion is justified.\nKeynesian economists believe that adding to profits and incomes during boom cycles through tax cuts, and removing income and profits from the economy through cuts in spending during downturns, tends to exacerbate the negative effects of the business cycle. This effect is especially pronounced when the government controls a large fraction of the economy, as increased tax revenue may aid investment in state enterprises in downturns, and decreased state revenue and investment harm those enterprises.\n\n\n=== Views on trade imbalance ===\nIn the last few years of his life, John Maynard Keynes was much preoccupied with the question of balance in international trade. He was the leader of the British delegation to the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference in 1944 that established the Bretton Woods system of international currency management.\nHe was the principal author of a proposal \u2013 the so-called Keynes Plan \u2013 for an International Clearing Union. The two governing principles of the plan were that the problem of settling outstanding balances should be solved by 'creating' additional 'international money', and that debtor and creditor should be treated almost alike as disturbers of equilibrium. In the event, though, the plans were rejected, in part because \"American opinion was naturally reluctant to accept the principle of equality of treatment so novel in debtor-creditor relationships\".The new system is not founded on free trade (liberalisation of foreign trade) but rather on regulating international trade to eliminate trade imbalances. Nations with a surplus would have a powerful incentive to get rid of it, which would automatically clear other nations' deficits. Keynes proposed a global bank that would issue its own currency\u2014the bancor\u2014which was exchangeable with national currencies at fixed rates of exchange and would become the unit of account between nations, which means it would be used to measure a country's trade deficit or trade surplus. Every country would have an overdraft facility in its bancor account at the International Clearing Union. He pointed out that surpluses lead to weak global aggregate demand \u2013 countries running surpluses exert a \"negative externality\" on trading partners, and posed far more than those in deficit, a threat to global prosperity. Keynes thought that surplus countries should be taxed to avoid trade imbalances.\nIn \"National Self-Sufficiency\" The Yale Review, Vol. 22, no. 4 (June 1933), he already highlighted the problems created by free trade.\nHis view, supported by many economists and commentators at the time, was that creditor nations may be just as responsible as debtor nations for disequilibrium in exchanges and that both should be under an obligation to bring trade back into a state of balance. Failure for them to do so could have serious consequences. In the words of Geoffrey Crowther, then editor of The Economist, \"If the economic relationships between nations are not, by one means or another, brought fairly close to balance, then there is no set of financial arrangements that can rescue the world from the impoverishing results of chaos.\"These ideas were informed by events prior to the Great Depression when \u2013 in the opinion of Keynes and others \u2013 international lending, primarily by the U.S., exceeded the capacity of sound investment and so got diverted into non-productive and speculative uses, which in turn invited default and a sudden stop to the process of lending.Influenced by Keynes, economic texts in the immediate post-war period put a significant emphasis on balance in trade. For example, the second edition of the popular introductory textbook, An Outline of Money, devoted the last three of its ten chapters to questions of foreign exchange management and in particular the 'problem of balance'. However, in more recent years, since the end of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, with the increasing influence of Monetarist schools of thought in the 1980s, and particularly in the face of large sustained trade imbalances, these concerns \u2013 and particularly concerns about the destabilising effects of large trade surpluses \u2013 have largely disappeared from mainstream economics discourse and Keynes' insights have slipped from view. They are receiving some attention again in the wake of the financial crisis of 2007\u201308.\n\n\n== Postwar Keynesianism ==\n\nKeynes's ideas became widely accepted after World War II, and until the early 1970s, Keynesian economics provided the main inspiration for economic policy makers in Western industrialized countries. Governments prepared high quality economic statistics on an ongoing basis and tried to base their policies on the Keynesian theory that had become the norm. In the early era of social liberalism and social democracy, most western capitalist countries enjoyed low, stable unemployment and modest inflation, an era called the Golden Age of Capitalism.\nIn terms of policy, the twin tools of post-war Keynesian economics were fiscal policy and monetary policy. While these are credited to Keynes, others, such as economic historian David Colander, argue that they are, rather, due to the interpretation of Keynes by Abba Lerner in his theory of functional finance, and should instead be called \"Lernerian\" rather than \"Keynesian\".Through the 1950s, moderate degrees of government demand leading industrial development, and use of fiscal and monetary counter-cyclical policies continued, and reached a peak in the \"go go\" 1960s, where it seemed to many Keynesians that prosperity was now permanent.  In 1971, Republican US President Richard Nixon even proclaimed \"I am now a Keynesian in economics.\"Beginning in the late 1960s, a new classical macroeconomics movement arose, critical of Keynesian assumptions (see sticky prices), and seemed, especially in the 1970s, to explain certain phenomena better. It was characterized by explicit and rigorous adherence to microfoundations, as well as use of increasingly sophisticated mathematical modelling.\nWith the oil shock of 1973, and the economic problems of the 1970s, Keynesian economics began to fall out of favour. During this time, many economies experienced high and rising unemployment, coupled with high and rising inflation, contradicting the Phillips curve's prediction. This stagflation meant that the simultaneous application of expansionary (anti-recession) and contractionary (anti-inflation) policies appeared necessary. This dilemma led to the end of the Keynesian near-consensus of the 1960s, and the rise throughout the 1970s of ideas based upon more classical analysis, including monetarism, supply-side economics, and new classical economics.\nHowever, by the late 1980s, certain failures of the new classical models, both theoretical (see Real business cycle theory) and empirical (see the \"Volcker recession\") hastened the emergence of New Keynesian economics, a school that sought to unite the most realistic aspects of Keynesian and neo-classical assumptions and place them on more rigorous theoretical foundation than ever before.\nOne line of thinking, utilized also as a critique of the notably high unemployment and potentially disappointing GNP growth rates associated with the new classical models by the mid-1980s, was to emphasize low unemployment and maximal economic growth at the cost of somewhat higher inflation (its consequences kept in check by indexing and other methods, and its overall rate kept lower and steadier by such potential policies as Martin Weitzman's share economy).\n\n\n=== Schools ===\nMultiple schools of economic thought that trace their legacy to Keynes currently exist, the notable ones being neo-Keynesian economics, New Keynesian economics, post-Keynesian economics, and the new neoclassical synthesis. Keynes's biographer Robert Skidelsky writes that the post-Keynesian school has remained closest to the spirit of Keynes's work in following his monetary theory and rejecting the neutrality of money. Today these ideas, regardless of provenance, are referred to in academia under the rubric of \"Keynesian economics\", due to Keynes's role in consolidating, elaborating, and popularizing them.\nIn the postwar era, Keynesian analysis was combined with neoclassical economics to produce what is generally termed the \"neoclassical synthesis\", yielding neo-Keynesian economics, which dominated mainstream macroeconomic thought. Though it was widely held that there was no strong automatic tendency to full employment, many believed that if government policy were used to ensure it, the economy would behave as neoclassical theory predicted. This post-war domination by neo-Keynesian economics was broken during the stagflation of the 1970s. There was a lack of consensus among macroeconomists in the 1980s, and during this period New Keynesian economics was developed, ultimately becoming- along with new classical macroeconomics- a part of the current consensus, known as the new neoclassical synthesis.Post-Keynesian economists, on the other hand, reject the neoclassical synthesis and, in general, neoclassical economics applied to the macroeconomy. Post-Keynesian economics is a heterodox school that holds that both neo-Keynesian economics and New Keynesian economics are incorrect, and a misinterpretation of Keynes's ideas. The post-Keynesian school encompasses a variety of perspectives, but has been far less influential than the other more mainstream Keynesian schools.Interpretations of Keynes have emphasized his stress on the international coordination of Keynesian policies, the need for international economic institutions, and the ways in which economic forces could lead to war or could promote peace.\n\n\n=== Keynesianism and liberalism ===\nIn a 2014 paper, economist Alan Blinder argues that, \"for not very good reasons,\" public opinion in the United States has associated Keynesianism with liberalism, and he states that such is incorrect.  For example, both Presidents Ronald Reagan (1981-89) and George W. Bush (2001-09) supported policies that were, in fact, Keynesian, even though both men were conservative leaders.  And tax cuts can provide highly helpful fiscal stimulus during a recession, just as much as infrastructure spending can. Blinder concludes, \"If you are not teaching your students that 'Keynesianism' is neither conservative nor liberal, you should be.\"\n\n\n== Other schools of macroeconomic thought ==\nThe Keynesian schools of economics are situated alongside a number of other schools that have the same perspectives on what the economic issues are, but differ on what causes them and how best to resolve them. Today, most of these schools of thought have been subsumed into modern macroeconomic theory.\n\n\n=== Stockholm School ===\n\nThe Stockholm school rose to prominence at about the same time that Keynes published his General Theory and shared a common concern in business cycles and unemployment. The second generation of Swedish economists also advocated government intervention through spending during economic downturns although opinions are divided over whether they conceived the essence of Keynes's theory before he did.\n\n\n=== Monetarism ===\n\nThere was debate between monetarists and Keynesians in the 1960s over the role of government in stabilizing the economy. Both monetarists and Keynesians agree that issues such as business cycles, unemployment, and deflation are caused by inadequate demand. However, they had fundamentally different perspectives on the capacity of the economy to find its own equilibrium, and the degree of government intervention that would be appropriate. Keynesians emphasized the use of discretionary fiscal policy and monetary policy, while monetarists argued the primacy of monetary policy, and that it should be rules-based.The debate was largely resolved in the 1980s. Since then, economists have largely agreed that central banks should bear the primary responsibility for stabilizing the economy, and that monetary policy should largely follow the Taylor rule \u2013 which many economists credit with the Great Moderation. The financial crisis of 2007\u201308, however, has convinced many economists and governments of the need for fiscal interventions and highlighted the difficulty in stimulating economies through monetary policy alone during a liquidity trap.\n\n\n=== Marxian economics ===\n\nSome Marxist economists criticized Keynesian economics. For example, in his 1946 appraisal Paul Sweezy\u2014while admitting that there was much in the General Theory's analysis of effective demand that Marxists could draw on\u2014described Keynes as a prisoner of his neoclassical upbringing. Sweezy argued that Keynes had never been able to view the capitalist system as a totality. He argued that Keynes regarded the class struggle carelessly, and overlooked the class role of the capitalist state, which he treated as a deus ex machina, and some other points.\nWhile Micha\u0142 Kalecki was generally enthusiastic about the Keynesian revolution, he predicted that it would not endure, in his article \"Political Aspects of Full Employment\". In the article Kalecki predicted that the full employment delivered by Keynesian policy would eventually lead to a more assertive working class and weakening of the social position of business leaders, causing the elite to use their political power to force the displacement of the Keynesian policy even though profits would be higher than under a laissez faire system: The erosion of social prestige and political power would be unacceptable to the elites despite higher profits.\n\n\n=== Public choice ===\n\nJames M. Buchanan criticized Keynesian economics on the grounds that governments would in practice be unlikely to implement theoretically optimal policies. The implicit assumption underlying the Keynesian fiscal revolution, according to Buchanan, was that economic policy would be made by wise men, acting without regard to political pressures or opportunities, and guided by disinterested economic technocrats. He argued that this was an unrealistic assumption about political, bureaucratic and electoral behaviour. Buchanan blamed Keynesian economics for what he considered a decline in America's fiscal discipline. Buchanan argued that deficit spending would evolve into a permanent disconnect between spending and revenue, precisely because it brings short-term gains, so, ending up institutionalizing irresponsibility in the federal government, the largest and most central institution in our society.Martin Feldstein argues that the legacy of Keynesian economics\u2013the misdiagnosis of unemployment, the fear of saving, and the unjustified government intervention\u2013affected the fundamental ideas of policy makers.Milton Friedman thought that Keynes's political bequest was harmful for two reasons. First, he thought whatever the economic analysis, benevolent dictatorship is likely sooner or later to lead to a totalitarian society. Second, he thought Keynes's economic theories appealed to a group far broader than economists primarily because of their link to his political approach.Alex Tabarrok argues that Keynesian politics\u2013as distinct from Keynesian policies\u2013has failed pretty much whenever it's been tried, at least in liberal democracies.In response to this argument, John Quiggin, wrote about these theories' implication for a liberal democratic order. He thought that if it is generally accepted that democratic politics is nothing more than a battleground for competing interest groups, then reality will come to resemble the model.\nPaul Krugman wrote \"I don\u2019t think we need to take that as an immutable fact of life; but still, what are the alternatives?\"\nDaniel Kuehn, criticized James M. Buchanan. He argued, \"if you have a problem with politicians - criticize politicians,\" not Keynes. He also argued that empirical evidence makes it pretty clear that Buchanan was wrong.James Tobin argued, if advising government officials, politicians, voters, it's not for economists to play games with them.\nKeynes implicitly rejected this argument, in \"soon or late it is ideas not vested interests which are dangerous for good or evil.\"Brad DeLong has argued that politics is the main motivator behind objections to the view that government should try to serve a stabilizing macroeconomic role. Paul Krugman argued that a regime that by and large lets markets work, but in which the government is ready both to rein in excesses and fight slumps is inherently unstable, due to intellectual instability, political instability, and financial instability.\n\n\n=== New classical ===\n\nAnother influential school of thought was based on the Lucas critique of Keynesian economics. This called for greater consistency with microeconomic theory and rationality, and in particular emphasized the idea of rational expectations. Lucas and others argued that Keynesian economics required remarkably foolish and short-sighted behaviour from people, which totally contradicted the economic understanding of their behaviour at a micro level.  New classical economics introduced a set of macroeconomic theories that were based on optimizing microeconomic behaviour. These models have been developed into the real business-cycle theory, which argues that business cycle fluctuations can to a large extent be accounted for by real (in contrast to nominal) shocks.\nBeginning in the late 1950s new classical macroeconomists began to disagree with the methodology employed by Keynes and his successors.  Keynesians emphasized the dependence of consumption on disposable income and, also, of investment on current profits and current cash flow. In addition, Keynesians posited a Phillips curve that tied nominal wage inflation to unemployment rate.  To support these theories, Keynesians typically traced the logical foundations of their model (using introspection) and supported their assumptions with statistical evidence. New classical theorists demanded that macroeconomics be grounded on the same foundations as microeconomic theory, profit-maximizing firms and rational, utility-maximizing consumers.The result of this shift in methodology produced several important divergences from Keynesian macroeconomics:\nIndependence of consumption and current income (life-cycle permanent income hypothesis)\nIrrelevance of current profits to investment (Modigliani\u2013Miller theorem)\nLong run independence of inflation and unemployment (natural rate of unemployment)\nThe inability of monetary policy to stabilize output (rational expectations)\nIrrelevance of taxes and budget deficits to consumption (Ricardian equivalence)\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nWorks by John Maynard Keynes at Project Gutenberg\n\"We are all Keynesians now\" \u2013 Historic article from Time magazine, 1965", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Bills_and_coins.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Capitalismlogo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Economic_Policy_-_Intervention_Strategy_Matrix.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Economics_circular_flow_cartoon.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Emblem-money.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/Keynescross.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6e/Keynesislm.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/Keynesliquiditytrap.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Keynesp180.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Red_rose_02.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Text_document_with_red_question_mark.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg"], "summary": "Keynesian economics ( KAYN-zee-\u0259n; sometimes Keynesianism, named after British economist John Maynard Keynes) are the various macroeconomic theories and models of how aggregate demand (total spending in the economy) strongly influences economic output and inflation. In the Keynesian view, aggregate demand does not necessarily equal the productive capacity of the economy. Instead, it is influenced by a host of factors \u2013 sometimes behaving erratically \u2013 affecting production, employment, and inflation.Keynesian economists generally argue that aggregate demand is volatile and unstable and that, consequently, a market economy often experiences inefficient macroeconomic outcomes \u2013 a recession, when demand is low, and inflation, when demand is high. Further, they argue that these economic fluctuations can be mitigated by economic policy responses coordinated between government and central bank. In particular, fiscal policy actions (taken by the government) and  monetary policy actions (taken by the central bank), can help stabilize economic output, inflation, and unemployment over the business cycle. Keynesian economists generally advocate a market economy \u2013 predominantly private sector, but with an active role for government intervention during recessions and depressions.Keynesian economics developed during and after the Great Depression from the ideas presented by Keynes in his 1936 book, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. Keynes' approach was a stark contrast to the aggregate supply-focused classical economics that preceded his book. Interpreting Keynes's work is a contentious topic, and several schools of economic thought claim his legacy.\nKeynesian economics, as part of the neoclassical synthesis, served as the standard macroeconomic model in the developed nations during the later part of the Great Depression, World War II, and the post-war economic expansion (1945\u20131973). It lost some influence following the oil shock and resulting stagflation of the 1970s. Keynesian economics was later redeveloped as New Keynesian economics, becoming part of the contemporary new neoclassical synthesis, that forms one current-day theory on  macroeconomics. The advent of the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 sparked renewed interest in Keynesian thought."}, "Elinor_Ostrom": {"links": ["Luther Gulick ", "Walton Hale Hamilton", "Paul Samuelson", "Environmental destruction", "Expropriation", "Catherine C.

In 2009, she was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for her \"analysis of economic governance, especially the commons\", which she shared with Oliver E. Williamson. To date, she remains the first of only two women to win the Nobel Prize in Economics, the other being Esther Duflo.\nAfter graduating with a B.A. and Ph.D. from UCLA, Ostrom lived in Bloomington, Indiana, and served on the faculty of Indiana University, with a late-career affiliation with Arizona State University. She was Distinguished Professor at Indiana University and the Arthur F. Bentley Professor of Political Science and co-director of the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis at Indiana University, as well as research professor and the founding director of the Center for the Study of Institutional Diversity at Arizona State University in Tempe. She was a lead researcher for the Sustainable Agriculture and Natural Resource Management Collaborative Research Support Program (SANREM CRSP), managed by Virginia Tech and funded by USAID. Beginning in 2008, she and her husband Vincent Ostrom advised the journal Transnational Corporations Review.Since the 60s, Ostrom was involved in resource management policy and created a research center, which attracted scientists from different disciplines from around the world. Working and teaching at her center was created on the principle of a workshop, rather than a university with lectures and a strict hierarchy.\nOstrom studied the interaction of people and ecosystems for many years and showed that the use of exhaustible resources by groups of people (communities, cooperatives, trusts, trade unions) can be rational and prevent depletion of the resource without government intervention.\n\n\n== Personal life and education ==\nElinor Claire Awan was born in Los Angeles, California as the only child of Leah Hopkins, a musician, and Adrian Awan, a set designer. Her parents separated early in her life, and Elinor lived with her mother most of the time. She attended a Protestant church with her mother and often spent weekends with her father's Jewish family. Growing up in the post-Depression era to divorced artisans, Ostrom described herself as a \"poor kid.\" Her major recreational activity was swimming, where she eventually joined a swimming team and swam competitively until she started teaching swimming to earn funds to help put herself through college.Ostrom grew up across the street from Beverly Hills High School, which she attended, graduating in 1951. \nShe regarded this as fortunate, for the school had a very high rate of college admittance. During Ostrom's junior year, she was encouraged to join the debate team. Learning debate tactics had an important impact on her ways of thinking. It allowed her to realize there are two sides to public policy and it is imperative to have quality arguments for both sides. As a high school student, Elinor Ostrom had been discouraged from studying trigonometry, as girls without top marks in algebra and geometry were not allowed to take the subject. No one in her immediate family had any college experience, but seeing that 90% of students in her high school attended college, she saw it as the \"normal\" thing to do. Her mother did not wish for her to attend college, seeing no reason for it.She attended UCLA, receiving a B.A. (with honors) in political science at UCLA in 1954. By attending multiple summer session and extra classes throughout semesters, she was able to graduate in three years. She worked at the library, dime store and bookstore in order to pay her fees which were $50 per semester. \nShe married a classmate, Charles Scott, and worked at General Radio in Cambridge, Massachusetts, while Scott attended Harvard Law School. They divorced several years later when Ostrom began contemplating a Ph.D. After graduation, she had trouble finding a job because employers presumed that she was only looking for jobs as a teacher or secretary. She began a job as an export clerk after taking a correspondence course for shorthand, which she later found to be helpful when taking notes in face-to-face interviews on research projects. After a year, she obtained a position as assistant personnel manager in a business firm that had never before hired a woman in anything but a secretarial position. This job inspired her to think about attending graduate-level courses and eventually applying for a research assistantship and admission to a Ph.D. program.Lacking trigonometry from high school, she was consequently rejected for an economics Ph.D. at UCLA. She was admitted to UCLA's graduate program in political science, where she was awarded an M.A. in 1962 and a Ph.D. in 1965. The teams of graduate students she was involved with were analyzing the political economic effects of a group of groundwater basins in Southern California. Specifically, Ostrom was assigned to look at the West Basin. She found it is very difficult to manage a common-pool resource when it is used between individuals. The locals were pumping too much groundwater and salt water seeped into the basin. Ostrom was impressed with how people from conflicting and overlapping jurisdictions who depended on that source found incentives to settle contradictions and solve the problem. She made the study of this collaboration the topic of her dissertation, laying the foundation for the study of \"shared resources\". The postgraduate seminar was led by Vincent Ostrom, an associate professor of political science, 14 years her senior, whom she married in 1963. This marked the beginning of a lifelong partnership that named \"love and contestation\" as Ostrom put it in her dedication to her seminal 1990 book, Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action.In 1961 Vincent Ostrom, Charles Tiebout, and Robert Warren published \"The Organization of Government in Metropolitan Areas,\" which would go on to be an influential article and introduced themes that would be central to the Ostroms' work. However, the article aggravated a conflict with UCLA's Bureau of Governmental Research because, counter to the Bureau's interests, it advised against centralization of metropolitan areas in favor of polycentrism. This conflict prompted the Ostroms to leave UCLA. They moved to Bloomington, Indiana, in 1965, when Vincent accepted a political science professorship at Indiana University. She joined the faculty as Visiting Assistant Professor. The first course she taught was an evening class on American government.\n\n\n== Career ==\nOstrom is probably best known for revisiting the so-called \u201ctragedy of the commons\" \u2013 a theory proposed by biologist Garrett Hardin in 1968. \"In an article by the same name published in the journal Science, Hardin theorized that if each herdsman sharing a piece of common grazing land made the individually rational economic decision of increasing the number of cattle he keeps on the land, the collective effect would deplete or destroy the commons. In other words, multiple individuals\u2014acting independently and rationally consulting their own self-interest\u2014will ultimately deplete a shared limited resource, even when it is clear that it is not in anyone\u2019s long-term interest for this to happen. Ostrom believes that the \u201ctragedy\u201d in such situations isn\u2019t inevitable, as Hardin thought. Instead, if the herders decide to cooperate with one another, monitoring each other\u2019s use of the land and enforcing rules for managing it, they can avoid the tragedy.\"Garrett Hardin believes that the most important aspect that we need to realize today is the need to abandon the principle of shared resources in reproduction. A possible alternative to the tragedy of the commons (shared needs) was described in Elinor Ostrom's book \"Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action\". The book demonstrates on a factual material that there are practical algorithms for the collective use of a limited common resource, which allow the selfish behavior of stakeholders within the framework of the accepted algorithms for quoting and control, while the result of interaction is not devastation, but rational use and renewal of the resource. \nOstrom was richly informed by fieldwork, both her own and that of others. During her PhD at the University of California, Los Angeles, she spent years studying the water wars and pumping races going on in the 1950s in her own dry backyard. In contrast to the prevailing rational-economic predictions of Malthusianism and the tragedy of the commons, she showed cases where humans were not trapped and helpless amid diminishing supplies. In her book Governing the Commons, she draws on studies of irrigation systems in Spain and Nepal, mountain villages in Switzerland and Japan, and fisheries in Maine and Indonesia.\nIn 1973, Ostrom and her husband founded the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis at Indiana University. Examining the use of collective action, trust, and cooperation in the management of common pool resources (CPR), her institutional approach to public policy, known as the Institutional analysis and development framework (IAD), has been considered sufficiently distinct to be thought of as a separate school of public choice theory. She authored many books in the fields of organizational theory, political science, and public administration. Elinor Ostrom was a dedicated scholar until the very end of her life. Indeed, on the day before she died, she sent e-mail messages to at least two different sets of coauthors about papers that she was writing with them. She was the chief scientific advisor for the International Council for Science (ICSU) Planet Under Pressure meeting in London in March, and Johan Rockstrom of the Stockholm Resilience Centre wrote that \"Lin, up until the very end, was heavily involved in our preparations for the Nobel laureate dialogues on global sustainability we will be hosting in Rio 17th and 18th of June during the UN Rio+20 Earth Summit. In the end, she decided she could not come in person, but was contributing sharp, enthusiastically charged, inputs, in the way only she could.\"\nIt was long unanimously held among economists that natural resources that were collectively used by their users would be over-exploited and destroyed in the long-term. Elinor Ostrom disproved this idea by conducting field studies on how people in small, local communities manage shared natural resources, such as pastures, fishing waters and forests. She showed that when natural resources are jointly used by their users, in time, rules are established for how these are to be cared for and used in a way that is both economically and ecologically sustainable.She was senior research director of the Vincent and Elinor Ostrom Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis, Distinguished Professor and Arthur F. Bentley Professor of Political Science in the College of Arts and Sciences, and professor in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs.Ostrom's innovative and ground-breaking research was supported by National Science Foundation, the Andrew Mellon Foundation, the Hynde and Harry Bradley Foundation, the MacArthur Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, U.S.A.I.D., the U.S. Geological Survey, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the National Institute of Mental Health.Ostrom has been involved in international activities throughout her long and productive career. Had experience in Kenya, Nepal and Nigeria, and also made research trips to Australia, Bolivia, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Philippines, Poland and Zimbabwe. During workshops and research grants, she and her husband supported many international students, visited researchers and policymakers. They did not have children of their own and used personal funds and efforts to receive grants to help others. In a 2010 interview, Ostrom noted that because they had no family to support, \u201cI was not ever concerned about salary, so that\u2019s never been an issue for me. For some colleagues who have big families, and all the rest, it\u2019s a major issue.\u201d Ostrom was a founding member and first president of the IASC (International Association for the Study of the Commons).\n\n\n== Research ==\nOstrom's early work emphasized the role of public choice on decisions influencing the production of public goods and services. Among her better known works in this area is her study on the polycentricity of police functions in Indianapolis. Caring for the commons had to be a multiple task, organised from the ground up and shaped to cultural norms. It had to be discussed face to face, and based on trust. Dr. Ostrom, besides poring over satellite data and quizzing lobstermen herself, enjoyed employing game theory to try to predict the behaviour of people faced with limited resources. In her Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis at Indiana University\u2014set up with her husband Vincent, a political scientist, in 1973\u2014her students were given shares in a national common. When they discussed what they should do before they did it, their rate of return from their \"investments\" more than doubled. Her later, and more famous, work focused on how humans interact with ecosystems to maintain long-term sustainable resource yields. Common pool resources include many forests, fisheries, oil fields, grazing lands, and irrigation systems. She conducted her field studies on the management of pasture by locals in Africa and irrigation systems management in villages of western Nepal (e.g., Dang Deukhuri). Her work has considered how societies have developed diverse institutional arrangements for managing natural resources and avoiding ecosystem collapse in many cases, even though some arrangements have failed to prevent resource exhaustion. Her work emphasized the multifaceted nature of human\u2013ecosystem interaction and argues against any singular \"panacea\" for individual social-ecological system problems.The Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis was meant to utilize diverse scholars throughout economics, political science, and other fields to collaborate and attempt to understand how institutional arrangements in a diverse set of ecological and social economic political settings affected behavior and outcomes. The goal was not to fly around the world collecting data, rather it is to create a network of scholars who live in particular areas of the world and had strong interests in forest conditions and forest policy conducted the studies.\n\n\n=== Design principles for Common Pool Resource (CPR) institution ===\nOstrom identified eight \"design principles\" of stable local common pool resource management:\nClearly defined  (clear definition of the contents of the common pool resource and effective exclusion of external un-entitled parties);\nThe appropriation and provision of common resources that are adapted to local conditions;\nCollective-choice arrangements that allow most resource appropriators to participate in the decision-making process;\nEffective monitoring by monitors who are part of or accountable to the appropriators;\nA scale of graduated sanctions for resource appropriators who violate community rules;\nMechanisms of conflict resolution that are cheap and of easy access;\nSelf-determination of the community recognized by higher-level authorities; and\nIn the case of larger common-pool resources, organization in the form of multiple layers of nested enterprises, with small local CPRs at the base level.These principles have since been slightly modified and expanded to include a number of additional variables believed to affect the success of self-organized governance systems, including effective communication, internal trust and reciprocity, and the nature of the resource system as a whole.Ostrom and her many co-researchers have developed a comprehensive \"Social-Ecological Systems (SES) framework\", within which much of the still-evolving theory of common-pool resources and collective self-governance is now located.\n\n\n=== Environmental protection ===\nAccording to the Norwegian Institute for Urban and Regional Research, \"Ostrom cautioned against single governmental units at global level to solve the collective action problem of coordinating work against environmental destruction. Partly, this is due to their complexity, and partly to the diversity of actors involved. Her proposal was that of a polycentric approach, where key management decisions should be made as close to the scene of events and the actors involved as possible.\" Ostrom helped disprove the idea held by economists that natural resources would be over-used and destroyed in the long run. Elinor Ostrom disproved this idea by conducting field studies on how people in small, local communities manage shared natural resources, such as pastures, fishing waters in Maine and Indonesia, and forests in Nepal. She showed that when natural resources are jointly managed by their users, in time, rules are established for how these are to be cared for and used in a way that is both economically and ecologically sustainable.\n\n\n=== Ostrom's law ===\nOstrom's law is an adage that represents how Elinor Ostrom's works in economics challenge previous theoretical frameworks and assumptions about property, especially the commons. Ostrom's detailed analyses of functional examples of the commons create an alternative view of the arrangement of resources that are both practically and theoretically possible. This eponymous law is stated succinctly by Lee Anne Fennell as:\n\nA resource arrangement that works in practice can work in theory.\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nOstrom was a member of the United States National Academy of Sciences, a member of the American Philosophical Society, and president of the American Political Science Association and the Public Choice Society. In 1999, she became the first woman to receive the prestigious Johan Skytte Prize in Political Science.Ostrom was awarded the Frank E. Seidman Distinguished Award for Political Economy in 1998. Her presented paper, on \"The Comparative Study of Public Economies\", was followed by a discussion among Kenneth Arrow, Thomas Schelling, and Amartya Sen. She was awarded the John J. Carty Award from the National Academy of Sciences in 2004, and, in 2005, received the James Madison Award by the American Political Science Association. In 2008, she became the first woman to receive the William H. Riker Prize in political science; and, the following year, she received the Tisch Civic Engagement Research Prize from the Jonathan M. Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service at Tufts University. In 2010, the Utne Reader magazine included Ostrom as one of the \"25 Visionaries Who Are Changing Your World\". She was named one of Time magazine's \"100 Most Influential People in the World\" in 2012.\n\nThe International Institute of Social Studies (ISS) awarded its Honorary Fellowship to her in 2002.In 2008 she was awarded an honorary degree, doctor honoris causa, at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.In July 2019, Indiana University Bloomington announced that as part of their Bridging the Visibility Gap initiative, a statue of Ostrom would be placed outside of the building which houses the University's political science department.\n\n\n=== Nobel Prize in Economics ===\nIn 2009, Ostrom became the first woman to receive the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences cited Ostrom \"for her analysis of economic governance\", saying her work had demonstrated how common property could be successfully managed by groups using it. Ostrom and Oliver E. Williamson shared the 10-million Swedish kronor (\u20ac990,000; $1.44 million) prize for their separate work in economic governance. As she had done with previous monetary prizes, Ostrom donated her award to the Workshop she helped to found.\n\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said Ostrom's \"research brought this topic from the fringe to the forefront of scientific attention...by showing how common resources\u2014forests, fisheries, oil fields or grazing lands\u2014can be managed successfully by the people who use them rather than by governments or private companies\". Ostrom's work in this regard challenged conventional wisdom, showing that common resources can be successfully managed without government regulation or privatization.In awarding Ostrom the Nobel Prize for the Analysis of Economic Governance, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences noted that her work \"teaches us novel lessons about the deep mechanisms that sustain cooperation in human societies.\" Even if Ostrom's selection (along with co-recipient Oliver Williamson of the University of California, Berkeley) seemed odd to some, others saw it as an appropriate reaction to free-market inefficiencies highlighted by the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\n== Death ==\nOstrom was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in October 2011. During the final year of her life, she continued to write and lecture, giving the Hayek Lecture at the Institute of Economic Affairs just eleven weeks before her death. She died at 6:40 a.m. Tuesday, June 12, 2012, at IU Health Bloomington Hospital at the age of 78. On the day of her death, she published her last article, \"Green from the Grassroots,\" in Project Syndicate. Indiana University president Michael McRobbie wrote: \"Indiana University has lost an irreplaceable and magnificent treasure with the passing of Elinor Ostrom\". Her Indiana colleague Michael McGinnis commented after her death that Ostrom donated her share of the $1.4 million Nobel award money to the Workshop\u2014the biggest, by far, of several academic prizes with monetary awards that the Ostroms had given to the center over the years. Her husband Vincent died 17 days later from complications related to cancer. He was 92.\n\n\n== Selected publications ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\nOstrom, Elinor (1990).

In 2009, she was awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for her \"analysis of economic governance, especially the commons\", which she shared with Oliver E. Williamson. To date, she remains the first of only two women to win the Nobel Prize in Economics, the other being Esther Duflo.\nAfter graduating with a B.A. and Ph.D. from UCLA, Ostrom lived in Bloomington, Indiana, and served on the faculty of Indiana University, with a late-career affiliation with Arizona State University. She was Distinguished Professor at Indiana University and the Arthur F. Bentley Professor of Political Science and co-director of the Workshop in Political Theory and Policy Analysis at Indiana University, as well as research professor and the founding director of the Center for the Study of Institutional Diversity at Arizona State University in Tempe. She was a lead researcher for the Sustainable Agriculture and Natural Resource Management Collaborative Research Support Program (SANREM CRSP), managed by Virginia Tech and funded by USAID. Beginning in 2008, she and her husband Vincent Ostrom advised the journal Transnational Corporations Review.Since the 60s, Ostrom was involved in resource management policy and created a research center, which attracted scientists from different disciplines from around the world. Working and teaching at her center was created on the principle of a workshop, rather than a university with lectures and a strict hierarchy.\nOstrom studied the interaction of people and ecosystems for many years and showed that the use of exhaustible resources by groups of people (communities, cooperatives, trusts, trade unions) can be rational and prevent depletion of the resource without government intervention."}, "Nobel_Peace_Prize": {"links": ["Parliament of Norway Building", "List of Indian Nobel laureates", "Mohamed ElBaradei", "List of Nobel laureates affiliated with

Since March 1901, it has been awarded annually (with some exceptions) to those who have \"done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses\".In accordance with Alfred Nobel's will, the recipient is selected by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, a five-member committee appointed by the Parliament of Norway. Since 2020 the prize is awarded in the Atrium of the University of Oslo, where it was also awarded 1947\u20131989; the Abel Prize is also awarded in the building. The prize was previously awarded in Oslo City Hall (1990\u20132019), the Norwegian Nobel Institute (1905\u20131946), and the Parliament (1901\u20131904).\nDue to its political nature, the Nobel Peace Prize has, for most of its history, been the subject of numerous controversies. The most recent prize for 2021 was awarded to Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov.\n\n\n== Background ==\nAccording to Nobel's will, the Peace Prize shall be awarded to the person who in the preceding year \"shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses\". Alfred Nobel's will further specified that the prize be awarded by a committee of five people chosen by the Norwegian Parliament.\n\nNobel died in 1896 and he did not leave an explanation for choosing peace as a prize category. As he was a trained chemical engineer, the categories for chemistry and physics were obvious choices. The reasoning behind the peace prize is less clear. According to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, his friendship with Bertha von Suttner, a peace activist and later recipient of the prize, profoundly influenced his decision to include peace as a category. Some Nobel scholars suggest it was Nobel's way to compensate for developing destructive forces. His inventions included dynamite and ballistite, both of which were used violently during his lifetime. Ballistite was used in war and the Irish Republican Brotherhood, an Irish nationalist organization, carried out dynamite attacks in the 1880s. Nobel was also instrumental in turning Bofors from an iron and steel producer into an armaments company.\nIt is unclear why Nobel wished the Peace Prize to be administered in Norway, which was ruled in union with Sweden at the time of Nobel's death. The Norwegian Nobel Committee speculates that Nobel may have considered Norway better suited to awarding the prize, as it did not have the same militaristic traditions as Sweden.  It also notes that at the end of the 19th century, the Norwegian parliament had become closely involved in the Inter-Parliamentary Union's efforts to resolve conflicts through mediation and arbitration.\n\n\n== Nomination and selection ==\n\nThe Norwegian Parliament appoints the Norwegian Nobel Committee, which selects the Nobel Peace Prize laureate.\n\n\n=== Nomination ===\nEach year, the Norwegian Nobel Committee specifically invites qualified people to submit nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize. The statutes of the Nobel Foundation specify categories of individuals who are eligible to make nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize. These nominators are:\n\nMembers of national assemblies and governments and members of the Inter-Parliamentary Union\nMembers of the Permanent Court of Arbitration and the International Court of Justice at the Hague\nMembers of Institut de Droit International\nAcademics at the professor or associate professor level in history, social sciences, philosophy, law, and theology, university rectors, university directors (or their equivalents), and directors of peace research and international affairs institutes\nPrevious recipients, including board members of organizations that have received the prize\nPresent and past members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee\nFormer permanent advisers to the Norwegian Nobel Institute\n\nThe working language of the Norwegian Nobel Committee is Norwegian; in addition to Norwegian the committee has traditionally received nominations in French, German and English, but today most nominations are submitted in either Norwegian or English. Nominations must usually be submitted to the committee by the beginning of February in the award year.  Nominations by committee members can be submitted up to the date of the first Committee meeting after this deadline.In 2009, a record 205 nominations were received, but the record was broken again in 2010 with 237 nominations; in 2011, the record was broken once again with 241 nominations. The statutes of the Nobel Foundation do not allow information about nominations, considerations, or investigations relating to awarding the prize to be made public for at least 50 years after a prize has been awarded. Over time, many individuals have become known as \"Nobel Peace Prize Nominees\", but this designation has no official standing, and means only that one of the thousands of eligible nominators suggested the person's name for consideration. Indeed, in 1939, Adolf Hitler received a satirical nomination from a member of the Swedish parliament, mocking the (serious but unsuccessful) nomination of Neville Chamberlain. Nominations from 1901 to 1967 have been released in a database.\n\n\n=== Selection ===\nNominations are considered by the Nobel Committee at a meeting where a shortlist of candidates for further review is created.  This shortlist is then considered by permanent advisers to the Nobel institute, which consists of the institute's Director and the Research Director and a small number of Norwegian academics with expertise in subject areas relating to the prize.  Advisers usually have some months to complete reports, which are then considered by the committee to select the laureate.  The Committee seeks to achieve a unanimous decision, but this is not always possible. The Nobel Committee typically comes to a conclusion in mid-September, but occasionally the final decision has not been made until the last meeting before the official announcement at the beginning of October.\n\n\n== Awarding the prize ==\n\nThe Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee presents the Nobel Peace Prize in the presence of the King of Norway and the Norwegian royal family on 10 December each year (the anniversary of Nobel's death). The Peace Prize is the only Nobel Prize not presented in Stockholm. The Nobel laureate receives a diploma, a medal, and a document confirming the prize amount. As of 2019, the prize was worth 9 million SEK. In 2020 the ceremony returned to its former venue, the Atrium of the University of Oslo Faculty of Law, after being held in Oslo City Hall during the period 1990\u20132019.From 1947 to 1989, the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony was held in the Atrium of the University of Oslo Faculty of Law, a few hundred meters from Oslo City Hall. Between 1905 and 1946, the ceremony took place at the Norwegian Nobel Institute. From 1901 to 1904, the ceremony took place in the Storting (Parliament).\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nSome commentators have suggested that the Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded in politically motivated ways for more recent or immediate achievements, or with the intention of encouraging future achievements. Some commentators have suggested that to award a peace prize on the basis of the unquantifiable contemporary opinion is unjust or possibly erroneous, especially as many of the judges cannot themselves be said to be impartial observers. Further criticism holds that the Nobel Peace Prize has become increasingly politicized, in which people are awarded for aspiration rather than accomplishment, which has allowed for the prize to be used for political effect but can cause perverse consequences due to the neglect of existing power politics.In 2011, a feature story in the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten contended that major criticisms of the award were that the Norwegian Nobel Committee ought to recruit members from professional and international backgrounds, rather than retired members of parliament; that there is too little openness about the criteria that the committee uses when they choose a recipient of the prize; and that the adherence to Nobel's will should be more strict. In the article, Norwegian historian \u00d8ivind Stenersen argues that Norway has been able to use the prize as an instrument for nation-building and furthering Norway's foreign policy and economic interests.In another 2011 Aftenposten opinion article, the grandson of one of Nobel's two brothers, Michael Nobel, also criticised what he believed to be the politicisation of the award, claiming that the Nobel Committee has not always acted in accordance with Nobel's will.\n\n\n=== Criticism of individual conferments ===\n\nThe awards given to Mikhail Gorbachev, Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres and Yasser Arafat, L\u00ea \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1ecd, Henry Kissinger, Jimmy Carter, Al Gore, Liu Xiaobo, Barack Obama, and the European Union have all been the subject of controversy.\nThe joint award given to L\u00ea \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1ecd and Henry Kissinger prompted two dissenting Committee members to resign. Th\u1ecd refused to accept the prize, on the grounds that such \"bourgeois sentimentalities\" were not for him and that peace had not been achieved in Vietnam. Th\u1ecd said many year later that he did not want to share the prize with Kissinger, who he called \"the representative of American aggressors\". Kissinger donated his prize money to charity, did not attend the award ceremony and later offered to return his prize medal after the fall of South Vietnam to North Vietnamese forces 18 months later.In 1994, K\u00e5re Kristiansen resigned from the Norwegian Nobel Committee in protest over the award of the prize to Yasser Arafat, whom he labeled \"world's most prominent terrorist\".\n\n\n=== Notable omissions ===\nForeign Policy has listed Mahatma Gandhi, Eleanor Roosevelt, U Thant, V\u00e1clav Havel, Ken Saro-Wiwa, Fazle Hasan Abed and Corazon Aquino as people who \"never won the prize, but should have\".The omission of Mahatma Gandhi has been particularly widely discussed, including in public statements by various members of the Nobel Committee. The committee has confirmed that Gandhi was nominated in 1937, 1938, 1939, 1947, and, finally, a few days before his assassination in January 1948. The omission has been publicly regretted by later members of the Nobel Committee. Geir Lundestad, Secretary of Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2006 said, \"The greatest omission in our 106-year history is undoubtedly that Mahatma Gandhi never received the Nobel Peace Prize. Gandhi could do without the Nobel Peace prize, whether Nobel committee can do without Gandhi is the question\". In 1948, following Gandhi's death, the Nobel Committee declined to award a prize on the ground that \"there was no suitable living candidate\" that year. Later, when the Dalai Lama was awarded the Peace Prize in 1989, the chairman of the committee said that this was \"in part a tribute to the memory of Mahatma Gandhi\".\n\n\n== List of Nobel Peace Prize laureates ==\n\nAs of November 2020, the Peace Prize has been awarded to 107 individuals and 28 organizations. 17 women have won the Nobel Peace Prize, more than any other Nobel Prize. Only two recipients have won multiple Prizes: the International Committee of the Red Cross has won three times (1917, 1944, and 1963) and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has won twice (1954 and 1981). L\u00ea \u0110\u1ee9c Th\u1ecd is the only person who refused to accept the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"The Nobel Peace Prize\" \u2013 Official webpage of the Norwegian Nobel Committee\n\"The Nobel Peace Prize\" at the official site of the Nobel Prize\n\"All Nobel Laureates in Peace\"\n\"The Nobel Prize Award Ceremonies\"\nWorld Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, official site with information on annual summits beginning in 1999\n\"National Peace Nobel Prize shares 1901\u20132009 by citizenship (or home of the organization) at the time of the award.\" \u2013 From J.

Since March 1901, it has been awarded annually (with some exceptions) to those who have \"done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses\".In accordance with Alfred Nobel's will, the recipient is selected by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, a five-member committee appointed by the Parliament of Norway. Since 2020 the prize is awarded in the Atrium of the University of Oslo, where it was also awarded 1947\u20131989; the Abel Prize is also awarded in the building. The prize was previously awarded in Oslo City Hall (1990\u20132019), the Norwegian Nobel Institute (1905\u20131946), and the Parliament (1901\u20131904).\nDue to its political nature, the Nobel Peace Prize has, for most of its history, been the subject of numerous controversies. The most recent prize for 2021 was awarded to Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov.\n\n"}, "Ballistite": {"links": ["Court of Appeal", "High explosive", "Patent infringement", "Sanremo", "House of Lords", "Guncotton", "Nitrocellulose", "Paul Vieille", "Poudre B", "Diphenylamine", "Petroleum jelly", "James Dewar", "Frederick Augustus Abel", "Smokeless powder", "Avigliana", "Acetone", "Black powder", "Cordite", "Alfred Nobel", "Nitroglycerin", "Collodion", "Camphor", "Great power"], "content": "Ballistite is a smokeless propellant made from two high explosives, nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine. It was developed and patented by Alfred Nobel in the late 19th century.\n\n\n== Military adoption ==\nAlfred Nobel patented Ballistite in 1887 while he was living in Paris.  His formulation was composed of 10% camphor and equal parts nitroglycerine and collodion. The camphor reacted with any acidic products of the chemical breakdown of the two explosives. This both stabilized the explosive against further decomposition and prevented spontaneous explosions. However, camphor tends to evaporate over time, leaving a potentially unstable mixture.Nobel's patent specified that the nitrocellulose should be \"of the well-known soluble kind\". He offered to sell the rights of the new explosive to the French government, but they declined, largely because they had just adopted Poudre B for military use. He subsequently licensed the rights to the Italian government, who entered into a contract, on 1 August 1889, to obtain 300,000 kilograms of Ballistite; and Nobel opened a factory at Avigliana, Turin.The Italian Army swiftly replaced their M1870 and M1870/87 rifles, which used black powder cartridges, to a new model, the M1890 Vetterli, which used a cartridge loaded with ballistite.\nAs Italy was a competing great power to France, this was not received well by the French press and the public. The newspapers accused Nobel of industrial espionage, by spying on Paul Vieille (the inventor of Poudre B), and \"high treason against France\". Following a police investigation, he was refused permission to conduct any more research, or to manufacture explosives in France. He therefore moved to San Remo in Italy, in 1891, where he spent the last five years of his life.Ballistite is still manufactured as a solid fuel rocket propellant, although the less volatile but chemically similar diphenylamine is used instead of camphor.\n\n\n== Development of cordite and unsuccessful claim by Nobel of patent infringement ==\nMeanwhile, a government committee in Great Britain, called the \"Explosives Committee\" and chaired by Sir Frederick Abel, monitored foreign developments in explosives. Abel and Sir James Dewar, who was also on the committee, jointly patented a modified form of ballistite in 1889. This consisted of 58% nitroglycerin by weight, 37% guncotton and 5% petroleum jelly. Using acetone as a solvent, it was extruded as spaghetti-like rods initially called \"cord powder\" or \"the committee's modification of ballistite\", but this was soon abbreviated to cordite.\nAfter unsuccessful negotiations, in 1893, Nobel sued Abel and Dewar over patent infringement and lost the case. It then went to the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords in 1895 where he also lost the two appeals and the Nobel's Explosives Company had to pay the costs. The claim was lost because the words \"of the well-known soluble kind\" in his patent were taken to mean soluble collodion, and to specifically exclude the ether-alcohol-insoluble guncotton.\n\n\n== References ==\nNotes\nSources", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg"], "summary": "Ballistite is a smokeless propellant made from two high explosives, nitrocellulose and nitroglycerine.

Founded in Roman times, it has a population of 55,000, and is known as a tourist destination on the Italian Riviera.  It hosts numerous cultural events, such as the Sanremo Music Festival and the Milan\u2013San Remo cycling classic.\n\n\n== Name ==\nThe name of the city is a phonetic contraction of Sant'Eremo di San Romolo, which refers to Romulus of Genoa, the successor to Syrus of Genoa. It is often stated in modern folk stories that Sanremo is a translation of \"Saint Remus\", a deceased Saint. In Ligurian, his name is San R\u0153mu. The spelling San Remo is on all ancient maps of Liguria, the ancient Republic of Genoa, Italy in the Middle Ages, the Kingdom of Sardinia, and the Kingdom of Italy. It was used in 1924 in official documents under Mussolini. This form of the name appears still on some road signs and, more rarely, in unofficial tourist information. It has been the most widely used form of the name in English at least since the 19th century.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nOnce the Roman settlement of Matutia or Villa Matutiana, Sanremo expanded in the Early Middle Ages when the population moved to the high grounds.  The nobility built a castle and the walled village of La Pigna to protect the town from Saracen raids.\nAt first subjected to the countship of Ventimiglia, the community later passed under the dominion of the Genoese bishops.  In 1297 they sold it to the Doria and De Mari families. It became a free town in the second half of the 15th century, after which it expanded to the Pigna hill and at Saint Syrus Cathedral. The almost perfectly preserved old village remains.\nSanremo remained independent of the Genoese Republic.  In 1753, after 20 years of fierce conflicts, it rose against Genoese hegemonical attempts. At that time Genoa built the fortress of Santa Tecla, situated on the beach near the port. The fortress was used as a prison until 2002.  It is now used as a museum.\nAfter the French domination and the Savoy restoration in 1814, Sanremo was annexed to the Kingdom of Sardinia. From the middle of the 18th century the town grew rapidly, in part due to the development of tourism, which saw the first grand hotels built and the town extended along the coast. The Empress \"Sissi\" of Austria, Empress Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, and Emperor Nicholas II of Russia vacationed in Sanremo, while Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel made it his permanent home.\nThe San Remo conference, 19\u201326 April 1920, of the post-World War I Allied Supreme Council determined the allocation of Class \"A\" League of Nations mandates for administration of the former Ottoman-ruled lands of the Middle East by the victorious powers.  The most notable of these was the British Mandate of Palestine.\n\n\n== Economy ==\n\nSanremo's Mediterranean climate and attractive seacoast setting on the Italian Riviera make it a popular tourist destination. Besides tourism, the city is active in the production of extra virgin-grade olive oil, whose regional \"designation of origin\" is protected (D.O.P., Denominazione di Origine Protetta).  It is one of the agricultural commodities in western Liguria and in particular within the province of Imperia. Sanremo is known as the City of Flowers (la Citt\u00e0 dei Fiori), this being another important aspect of the economy of the city. The nearby towns of Arma di Taggia, Bordighera and Ospedaletti are also involved in the cultivation of flowers for the international flower market of Sanremo.\nThe Municipal Casino, built in 1905, is an example of Art Nouveau building. The Ariston Theatre offers annual series of concerts, operas and theatre plays. The Symphony Orchestra is one of twelve symphony orchestras recognized by the state of Italy; it performs some 120 concerts throughout the year, most in the Municipal Casino's Opera Theatre.\n\n\n== Transportation ==\n\nThe city is connected to Genoa and to Ventimiglia, the border city with France, by the A10 motorway, whose last part is also known as the Autostrada dei Fiori (\"Motorway of Flowers\"). It has a large number of elevated sections with viaducts that give a panoramic view of the coast. The A10 joins the French A8 highway at the border between Ventimiglia and Menton. Together these national routes are part of the European route E80. The A10 motorway is a toll road, and the A8 demands a toll in sections, and some sections are free of charge.  When travelling from Italy into France, one does not pay until after the towns of Menton and Monaco.\nOther roads of importance are the SS1, the \"Aurelia Bis\", which connects Sanremo to Taggia. This is a non-toll bypass route. The coast road is the via Aurelia or SS1 and follows the route of a Roman road. This can be heavily congested when it passes through towns, as it has only one lane in either direction for most of way around Sanremo.  A trolleybus line along the via Aurelia links Sanremo with both Taggia and Ventimiglia.\nThe closest airport to Sanremo is in France, the C\u00f4te d'Azur International Airport in Nice, 45 minutes away by car. The railway connects the city to the other Ligurian cities like Imperia, Genoa and to Nice, Milan, Turin and Rome.\nThe railway line used to be along the coast, running close to the sea, and providing a view for travellers.  The line has been moved further north and underground, which allows for faster trains; Sanremo railway station was relocated next to the City Hall. The city has refurbished the old railway line and converted it into a bike route and pedestrian area. There are several bike hire kiosks along the route and a choice of beaches to visit in either direction from San Remo. The path stretches 24 km (15 mi) between Ospedaletti in the west and San Lorenzo al Mare in the east.\n\n\n== Geography ==\n\n\n=== Climate ===\nSanremo experiences a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Csa).\n\n\n== Culture ==\n\n\n=== Music festival ===\nThe Ariston Theatre hosts the celebrated annual Sanremo Music Festival, a very popular song contest held in the city since 1951. This festival inspired the Eurovision Song Contest, which started in 1956, and for years the Sanremo festival selected the Italian entry. The internationally notable song Nel blu dipinto di blu, also known as Volare, was performed at this festival for the first time by Domenico Modugno in 1958. The festival is so popular among Italians that it is often referred to simply as \"Il Festival\" (The Festival). Other events include the Tenco Prize (autumn), a song contest for authors dedicated to the memory of Luigi Tenco; the Flowers Parade in January/February in which every city of the Italian Riviera presents an original composition of flowers displayed on a Carnival/Mardi-Gras style moving car; and the summer Firework International Contest in the second week of August also called Ferragosto.\n\n\n=== Cuisine ===\nThe culinary specialities of Sanremo and environs include Sardenara, Focaccia, Focaccia alle Cipolle, Torta Verde, Farinata and Taggiasca olives.\n\n\n=== Gambling ===\nThe Sanremo Casino (Casino Municipale di Sanremo) opened in 1905 and has operated continuously since then with the exception of the years of World War II.  For much of its history, the casino was tolerated or granted exceptions to Italian gambling laws in order to allow the resort to compete with the casino towns in nearby France and Monaco.  \nSanremo hosts an annual poker tournament as part of the European Poker Tour. The city is widely accepted as the origin of the five-card stud variant telesina.\n\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe Rallye Sanremo is a rally competition that was part of the FIA World Rally Championship from 1973 to 2003, when it was replaced by Rally d'Italia Sardegna on the island of Sardinia, in hosting the Italian round of the WRC. It is now part of European Rally Championship. Formerly a mixed surface event (tarmac and gravel), the rally has later been an all-tarmac event and takes place around the mountains.\nSanremo is the finish of the classic Milan\u2013San Remo cycle race. It is considered to be a \"monument\" - one of the five most important one-day races of the cycling season. Milan \u2013 San Remo is traditionally held in March and is one of the first major fixtures on the cycling season. At 298 kilometres (185 mi) long, it is the longest professional one-day race in cycling, giving the race a unique character.\nThe famous local football club is the Sanremese that has played also in Serie B and in Serie C.\n\n\n== Notable people ==\nMercurial Italian tennis player Fabio Fognini.\nThe Venerable Giorgio Baldassarre Oppezzi, a monk who died in 1525, and whose body was later discovered to be incorrupt, is buried here in the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli.\nItalian singer Luigi Tenco died in Sanremo shortly after his performance at the 1967 Italian Song Festival.\nEmpress Maria Alexandrovna, consort of Alexander II of Russia, spent the winter of 1874 in Sanremo and as a gift to the city she donated the palms along the seaside walk of Corso Imperatrice (Empress Avenue).\nAlfred Nobel bought a villa in Sanremo in 1891 and died there in 1896. Since 2002 it has housed a permanent exhibit on the most important discoveries of the 19th century including the research interests of Nobel himself. Sanremo continues to maintain its ties with Nobel, long after his death. Each 10 December (the date that Nobel died in 1896) large quantities of flowers sent by the province of Imperia, the city of Sanremo and the Board for Tourist Promotion of the Riviera dei fiori adorn the annual Nobel Prize Award Ceremony and Banquet in Stockholm.\nItalian writer Italo Calvino spent his youth in Sanremo and many of his novels, including Il Barone Rampante, are reminiscent of his attachment to the city.\nEdward James, British poet known for his patronage of the surrealist art movement, died in Sanremo on December 2, 1984.\nEdward Lear, English artist, illustrator and writer known for his nonsense poetry and limericks, lived and died in Sanremo. His tombstone is in the Foce Cemetery.\nThe Italian actor and comedian Carlo Dapporto was born in Sanremo and became a household name in post-war Italy.\nThe Sicilian playwright and Nobel Prize winner Luigi Pirandello lived in Sanremo in 1933-34 and was appointed artistic director of the Casino.\nThe writer Tobias Smollett stayed a few days in Sanremo in 1765 and described it thus: \"St. Remo is a pretty considerable town, well-built upon the declivity of a gently rolling hill...There is very little plain ground in this neighbourhood; but the hills are covered with oranges, lemons, pomegranates and olives....The women of St. Remo are much more handsome and better tempered than those of Provence.\" Travels through France and Italy (1766)\nItalian director and cinematographer Mario Bava was born in Sanremo in 1914.\nItalian-born sculptor Giuseppe Moretti lived in Sanremo in his final years and died here in February 1935.  Moretti designed the world's largest cast iron statue, of the Roman god Vulcan (56 ft or 17 m), which stands atop Red Mountain in Birmingham, Alabama (USA).
