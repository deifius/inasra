"Slovak Paradise (Slovak: Slovensk\u00fd raj) is a mountain range in eastern Slovakia. It is a part of the Spi\u0161-Gemer Karst, which in turn is a part of the Slovak Ore Mountains, a major subdivision of the Western Carpathians. It is located between the towns of Spi\u0161sk\u00e1 Nov\u00e1 Ves in the north and Dob\u0161in\u00e1 in the south. It is particularly known for its gorges and waterfalls. It is very popular with hikers as it has a number of unusual routes through gorges and waterfalls. There are numerous sections where fixed ladders are used to climb. The area is protected by Slovak Paradise National Park (N\u00e1rodn\u00fd park Slovensk\u00fd raj)."
