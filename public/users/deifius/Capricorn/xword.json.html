ibex), also known as the steinbock, bouquetin, or simply ibex, is a species of wild goat that lives in the mountains of the European Alps. It is a sexually dimorphic species: males are larger and carry longer, curved horns than females. Its coat colour is typically brownish grey. Alpine ibex tend to live in steep, rough terrain near the snow line. They are also social, although adult males and females segregate for most of the year, coming together only to mate. Four distinct groups exist; adult male groups, female-offspring groups, groups of young individuals, and mixed-sex groups.\nDuring the breeding season, males fight for access to females, and use their long horns in agonistic behaviour. After being extirpated from most areas by the 19th century, the Alpine ibex was successfully reintroduced to parts of its historical range. All individuals living today descend from the stock in Gran Paradiso National Park in Aosta Valley and Piemonte (Italy), a national park created to help the ibex thrive. The ibex is the emblem of both the Gran Paradiso National Park, and the contiguous Vanoise National Park across the French border. The species is currently listed as of least concern by the IUCN, but went through a population bottleneck of less than 100 individuals during its near-extinction event. This has led to very low genetic diversity across populations.\n\n\n== Taxonomy and phylogeny ==\nThe Alpine ibex was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. It is classified in the genus Capra (Latin for \"goat\") with at least seven other species of wild goats. Both Capra and Ovis (sheep) descended from a goral-like animal from the Miocene and early Pliocene, whose fossils are found in Kenya, China, and Slovenia. The genus Tossunnoria appears in China during the late Miocene and appears to have been intermediate between gorals and goats. Fossils of Alpine ibex date back to the late Pleistocene, when  the Spanish ibex and it probably evolved from the extinct Pleistocene species Capra camburgensis. The Nubian (C. nubiana), walia (C. walie), and Siberian ibexes (C. sibirica) were previously considered to be subspecies of the Alpine ibex, giving populations in the Alps the trinomial of C. i. ibex.\n\n\n== Appearance ==\n\nCompared with other members of its genus, the Alpine ibex has a short, broad head and a duller coat. It has brownish-grey hair over most of the body, a pale abdomen, and slightly darker markings on the chin and throat and in a stripe along the back. They moult twice a year, firstly in April or May, and then again in September, when they replace the short summer coat with thicker hair and a woolly undercoat.Males commonly grow to a height of 90 to 101 cm (35 to 40 in) at the withers, with a body length of 149 to 171 cm (59 to 67 in) and weigh from 67 to 117 kg (148 to 258 lb). Females are noticeably smaller, with a shoulder height of 73 to 84 cm (29 to 33 in), a body length of 121 to 141 cm (48 to 56 in), and a weight of 17 to 32 kg (37 to 71 lb). Both male and female Alpine ibex have large, backwards-curving horns with numerous ridges along their length. At 69 to 98 cm (27 to 39 in), those of the males are substantially larger than those of females, which reach only 18 to 35 cm (7.1 to 13.8 in) in length.\n\n\n== Distribution and ecology ==\n\nThe Alpine ibex was, at one point, restricted only to the Gran Paradiso National Park in northern Italy, and the contiguous Maurienne Valley in the French Alps but it was reintroduced to most of the Alps. Reintroductions started in 1906 into Switzerland. Alpine ibex are now found in most or all of the Italian and French alpine ranges, southern Germany, Switzerland and Austria. It has also been introduced to Bulgaria and Slovenia.An excellent climber, its preferred habitat is the rocky region along the snow line above alpine forests, where it occupies steep, rough terrain at elevations of 1,800 to 3,300 m (5,900 to 10,800 ft). Alpine ibex are typically absent from woodland areas, although adult males in densely populated areas may stay in larch and mixed larch-spruce woodland if no snow has fallen. Males spend the winter in coniferous forests. For most of the year, males and females occupy different habitats. Females rely on steep terrain more so than males. Males use lowland meadows during the spring, which is when snow melts and green grass appears. They then climb to alpine meadows during the summer. When winter arrives, both sexes move to steep, rocky slopes that amass little snow. They prefer slopes of 30\u201345\u00b0 and use small caves and overhangs for shelter. Home ranges are highly variable, depending on the availability of resources, and vary in size throughout the year. Figures from 180 to 2,800 ha (0.69 to 10.81 sq mi) have been recorded. Home ranges tend to be largest during summer and autumn, smallest in winter, and intermediate in spring. Female home ranges are usually smaller than those of males. Alpine ibex appear to have a low rate of predation and in Gran Paradiso typically die of age, starvation, or disease.\n\n\n=== Foraging ===\n\nAlpine ibex are strictly herbivorous, with over half of their diet consisting of grasses, and the remainder being a mixture of mosses, flowers, leaves, and twigs. If leaves and shoots are out of reach, they often stand on their rear legs to reach this food. Grass genera that are the most commonly eaten are Agrostis, Avena, Calamagrostis, Festuca, Phleum, Poa, Sesleria, and Trisetum. The climbing ability of the Alpine ibex is such that it has been observed standing on the sheer face of the Cingino Dam in Piedmont, Italy, where it licks the stonework to obtain mineral salts.\n\n\n== Life history ==\nAlthough the Alpine ibex is a social species, they segregate sexually and spatially depending on the season. Four types of groups exist: Adult male groups, female-offspring groups, groups of young individuals 2\u20133 years old, and mixed-sex groups. Young groups are numerous at the beginning of summer, but are expelled by females at the end of their gestation period. Female and offspring groups occur year-round, at least in an area of the French Alps. Mixed-sex groups of adult males and females occur during breeding, which lasts from December to January. By April and May, the adults separate. The largest aggregations of either sex occur during June and July. Gatherings of males begin to decrease during October and November, and are lowest from the rut from December to March. The males then leave their separate wintering areas and gather again.\n\nA linear dominance hierarchy exists among males. In small populations, which are more cohesive, males know their place in the hierarchy based on memories of past encounters, while in mobile and large groups, where encounters with strangers are common, rank is based on horn size. Antagonistic behavior in males can come in the form of \"direct\" or \"indirect\" aggression. With direct aggression, one male bumps another with his horns or places himself in front of his opponent. He stands on his hind legs and comes down on his opponent with his horns. This may signal that he is ready to clash or may be attempting a real clash.  Indirect aggression is mostly intimidation displays.\n\n\n=== Reproduction and growth ===\nThe breeding season starts in December, and typically lasts around six weeks. During this time, male herds break up into smaller groups that search for females. The rut takes place in two phases. In the first phase, the male groups interact with the females that are all in oestrous. The higher the male's rank, the closer he can get to a female. Males perform courtship displays. In the second phase of the rut, one male separates from his group to follow an individual female.  He displays to her and guards her from other males.  Before copulation, the female moves her tail and courtship becomes more intense. They copulate and then he rejoins his group and reverts to the first phase. Gestation lasts around 167 days, and results in the birth of one or two kids, with twins making up about 20% of births.Alpine ibex reach sexual maturity at 18 months, but females do not reach their maximum body size for five to six years, and males not for 9\u201311 years. The horns grow throughout life, growing most rapidly during the second year of life, and thereafter by about 8 cm (3.1 in) a year, eventually slowing to half that rate once the animal reaches 10 years of age. Alpine ibex live for up to 19 years in the wild.\n\n\n== Conservation status ==\n\nThe Alpine ibex historically ranged through France, Italy, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Bavaria, Austria and Slovenia. Starting in the early 16th century and with firearms becoming common, the overall population declined due to overexploitation and poaching. The ibex became extirpated in Switzerland and Germany by the 18th century, and was extirpated in Austria and northeastern Italy by the 19th century. They remained only in and around the adjacent Gran Paradiso and Vanoise Massifs, then both part of the Kingdom of Sardinia. Located in the western Italian Alps and the Maurienne valley in the north eastern French alps, bordering the Vanoise and Gran Paradiso Massif, the park was declared a royal hunting reserve in 1854 with the name of \"Royal hunting reserve of Gran Paradiso\" by Victor Emmanuel II, the first king of a united Italy.Ibex were protected from poaching and their numbers increased, reaching 3,020 in 1914. The ibex enjoyed further protection when Gran Paradiso was made into a national park in 1922. Animals from this population naturally dispersed into surrounding regions. However, reintroductions have been the predominant source of new populations. Today, the total population of Alpine ibex is over 30,000 and is considered to be of Least Concern by the IUCN. However, Alpine ibex have low genetic diversity putting them at risk of inbreeding depression.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAlpine Ibex European Specialists Group\nUltimate Ungulate factsheet\nAnimal Planet Mammal Guide", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Alpensteinbock_%28Capra_ibex%29_Zoo_Salzburg_2014_h.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/AlpineIbex.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Alpine_ibex_Cima_di_Terrarossa_7.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/01/Bouquetin01.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Bouquetins_combat.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Jeune_bouquetin_sur_un_rocher.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Leefgebied_alpensteenbok.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Okapi2.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Stambecchi_sulla_diga_del_Cingino.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Steinwild_Augstmatthorn.ogv", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Steinwild_Augstmatthorn.ogv", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/The_Matterhorn_as_seen_from_Zermatt.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg"], "summary": "The Alpine ibex (Capra ibex), also known as the steinbock, bouquetin, or simply ibex, is a species of wild goat that lives in the mountains of the European Alps.

including the Cantabrian Mountains, the Pyrenees, the Alps and the Apennines, the Dinarides, the Tatra and the Carpathian Mountains, the Balkan Mountains, the Rila\u2013Rhodope massif, Pindus, the northeastern mountains of Turkey, and the Caucasus. The chamois has also been introduced to the South Island of New Zealand. Some subspecies of chamois are strictly protected in the EU under the European Habitats Directive.\n\n\n== Names ==\n\nThe English name comes from French chamois. The latter is derived from Gaulish camox (attested in Latin, 5th century), itself perhaps borrowing from some Alpine language (Raetic, Ligurian). The Gaulish form also underlies German Gemse, Gams, G\u00e4mse, Italian camoscio, Ladin ciamorz.\nThe usual pronunciation for the animal is UK:  or US: , approximating the French pronunciation [\u0283amwa]. However, when referring to chamois leather, and in New Zealand often for the animal itself, it is , and sometimes spelt shammy or chamy. The plural of \"chamois\" is spelled the same as the singular, and it may be pronounced with the final \"s\" sounded. However, as with many other quarry species, the plural for the animal is often pronounced the same as the singular.\nThe Dutch name for the chamois is gems, and the male is called a gemsbok. In Afrikaans, the name gemsbok came to refer to a species of Subsaharan antelope of the genus Oryx, and this meaning of \"gemsbok\" has been adopted into English.\n\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe chamois (along with sheep and goats) are in the goat-antelope subfamily (Caprinae) of the family Bovidae.\nThere are two species of chamois in the genus Rupicapra:\n\nRupicapra rupicapra\nRupicapra pyrenaicaThe species R. rupicapra  is categorized into seven subspecies:\n\nR. r. asiatica (Anatolian chamois or Turkish chamois): Turkey\nR. r. balcanica (Balkan chamois): Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, northern Greece (the Pindus Mountains), North Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro, and Slovenia (isolated populations)\nR. r. carpatica (Carpathian chamois): Romania\nR. r. cartusiana (Chartreuse chamois): France\nR. r. caucasica (Caucasian chamois): Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russia\nR. r. rupicapra (Alpine chamois): Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Slovenia, Slovakia (Ve\u013ek\u00e1 Fatra, Slovak Paradise)\nR. r. tatrica (Tatra chamois): Slovakia (Tatras and Low Tatras) and Poland (Tatras)\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe chamois is a very small bovid. A fully grown chamois reaches a height of 70\u201380 cm (28\u201331 in) and measures 107\u2013137 cm (42\u201354 in) (the tail is not generally visible except when mating). Males, which weigh 30\u201360 kg (66\u2013132 lb), are slightly larger than females, which weigh 25\u201345 kg (55\u201399 lb). Both males and females have short, straightish horns which are hooked backwards near the tip, the horn of the male being thicker. In summer, the fur has a rich brown colour which turns to a light grey in winter. Distinct characteristics are white contrasting marks on the sides of the head with pronounced black stripes below the eyes, a white rump and a black stripe along the back.\n\n\n== Biology and behaviour ==\n\nFemale chamois and their young live in herds of up to 15 to 30 individuals; adult males tend to live solitarily for most of the year. During the rut (late November/early December in Europe, May in New Zealand), males engage in fierce battles for the attention of unmated females. An impregnated female undergoes a gestation period of 170 days, after which a single kid is usually born in May or early June.  On rare occasions, twins may be born. If a mother is killed, other females in the herd may try to raise the young. The kid is weaned at six months of age and is fully grown by one year of age. However, the kids do not reach sexual maturity until they are three to four years old, although some females may mate at as early two years old. At sexual maturity, young males are forced out of their mother's herds by dominant males (who sometimes kill them), and then wander somewhat nomadically until they can establish themselves as mature breeding specimens at eight to nine years of age.Chamois eat various types of vegetation, including highland grasses and herbs during the summer and conifers, barks and needles from trees in winter. Primarily diurnal in activity, they often rest around mid-day and may actively forage during moonlit nights.Chamois can reach an age of 22 years in captivity, although the maximum recorded in the wild is from 15 to 17 years of age. Common causes of mortality can include avalanches, epidemics and predation. At present, humans are the main predator of chamois. In the past, the principal predators were Eurasian lynxes, Persian leopards and gray wolves; with some predation possibly by brown bears and golden eagles. Chamois usually use speed and stealthy evasion to escape predators and can run at 50 kilometers per hour (31 mph) and can jump 2 m (6.6 ft) vertically into the air or over a distance of 6 m (20 ft).\n\n\n== Distribution and habitat ==\n\nThe chamois is native to the Pyrenees, the mountains of south and central Europe, Turkey, and the Caucasus. It lives in precipitous, rugged, rocky terrain at moderately high elevations of up to at least 3,600 m (11,800 ft). In Europe, the chamois spends the summer months in alpine meadows above the tree line, but moves to elevations of around 800 m (2,600 ft) to spend the winter in pine-dominated forests.\n\n\n== In New Zealand ==\nAlpine chamois arrived in New Zealand in 1907 as a gift from the Austrian Emperor, Franz Joseph I in exchange for specimens of living ferns, rare birds and lizards. Mr Albert E.L. Bertling, formerly head keeper of the Zoological Society's Gardens, Regents Park, London, accepted an invitation from the New Zealand Government to deliver a consignment of chamois (two bucks and six does) to the colony. They arrived in Wellington, New Zealand, on 23 January 1907, on board the \"SS Turakina\". From Wellington the chamois were transhipped to the \"Manaroa\" and conveyed to Lyttelton, then by rail to Fairlie in South Canterbury and a four-day horse trek to Mount Cook. The first surviving releases were made in the Aoraki / Mount Cook region and these animals gradually spread over much of the South Island.In New Zealand, chamois hunting is unrestricted and even encouraged by the Department of Conservation to limit the animal's impact on New Zealand's native alpine flora.New Zealand chamois tend to weigh about 20% less than European individuals of the same age, suggesting that food supplies may be limited.\n\n\n== Hunting and wildlife management ==\nAs their meat is considered tasty, chamois are popular game animals. Chamois have two traits that are exploited by hunters: the first is that they are most active in the morning and evening when they feed; the second is that they tend to look for danger originating from below, which means that a hunter stalking chamois from above is less likely to be observed and more likely to be successful.The tuft of hair from the back of the neck, the gamsbart (chamois \"beard\"), is traditionally worn as a decoration on hats throughout the alpine countries.\n\n\n== Chamois leather ==\n\nChamois leather, traditionally made from the hide of the chamois, is very smooth and absorbent and is favoured in cleaning, buffing, and polishing because it produces no scratching. Modern chamois leather may be made from chamois hides, but hides of deer or domestic goats or sheep are commonly used.\n\n\n== Chamois fabric ==\nA fabric known as chamois is made variously from cotton flannel, PVA, Viscose, and other materials with similar qualities.  It is napped to produce a plush surface similar to moleskin or chamois leather.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCantabrian chamois\nPyrenean chamois\nTatra chamois\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nITIS (Integrated Taxonomic Information System) report for the species Chamois\nNew Zealand Chamois and their distribution in New Zealand\nChamois is the logo for the French ski manufacturer - Duret Archived 6 March 2016 at the Wayback Machine\n Texts on Wikisource:\n\"Chamois\".

It is a part of the Spi\u0161-Gemer Karst, which in turn is a part of the Slovak Ore Mountains, a major subdivision of the Western Carpathians. It is located between the towns of Spi\u0161sk\u00e1 Nov\u00e1 Ves in the north and Dob\u0161in\u00e1 in the south. It is particularly known for its gorges and waterfalls. It is very popular with hikers as it has a number of unusual routes through gorges and waterfalls. There are numerous sections where fixed ladders are used to climb. The area is protected by Slovak Paradise National Park (N\u00e1rodn\u00fd park Slovensk\u00fd raj).\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nSlovak Paradise is a plain with high plateaus (800\u20131000 m AMSL). The highest mountain is  Ondrejisko at 1,270 m. The area is mainly built of karst limestone (Geravy, Glac, Pelc and Skala plains) and dolomite (Tri kopce). The karst plateaus show phenomena such as sinkholes and limestone pavements (lapies). The climate is moderately cold.\nTypical features are canyons, gorges, and ravines (Sokol, Such\u00e1 Bel\u00e1, Piecky and Kyse\u013e), which form picturesque rocky scenes with waterfalls, and which were created mainly by the Hnilec and Horn\u00e1d rivers and their tributaries. Eighty percent of the area is covered with spruce forests combined with yew trees.\nThere are more than 200 caves and underground abysses. Among the caves, Dob\u0161in\u00e1 Ice Cave and Medvedia jasky\u0148a (Bear Cave) are the best known ones.\nThere were many settlements of woodcutters, colliers and smelters in Slovak Paradise once, which were turned into tourist centers; for example, Dob\u0161insk\u00e1 Ma\u0161a, Dedinky, Mlynky, and Straten\u00e1.\n\n\n== Fauna ==\nNotable and rare animals include the brown bear (Ursus arctos), golden eagle, common kestrel and the black stork. Quite common are red deer and wild boars, wolf (Canis lupus), lynx (Lynx lynx), and the otter (Lutra lutra).\n\n\n== Flora ==\nThe area is covered with Norway spruce (Picea abies), European beech (Fagus sylvatica), fir, larch, and Scots  pine (Pinus sylvestris).\nImportant endemic plants in the area are the Carpathian harebell (Campanula carpatica), Pulsatilla slavica, Hesperis silvestris, Liguria sibirica, and Saxifraga paniculate. Other plants found in this area are the mountain tassel flower (Soldanella montana), martagon lily (Lilium martagon), and variegated monk's hood (Aconitum variegatum).\n\n\n== See also ==\nSlovak Paradise National Park\nMountain Rescue Service (Slovakia)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nwww.slovenskyraj.sk/en.html", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Slovensky_raj-Stratenska_pila.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Slovensk%C3%BD_r%C3%A1j_-_mapa.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg"], "summary": "Slovak Paradise (Slovak: Slovensk\u00fd raj) is a mountain range in eastern Slovakia.

rocks such as limestone, dolomite, and gypsum. It is characterized by underground drainage systems with sinkholes and caves. It has also been documented for more weathering-resistant rocks, such as quartzite, given the right conditions. Subterranean drainage may limit surface water, with few to no rivers or lakes. However, in regions where the dissolved bedrock is covered (perhaps by debris) or confined by one or more superimposed non-soluble rock strata, distinctive karst features may occur only at subsurface levels and can be totally missing above ground.The study of paleokarst (buried karst in the stratigraphic column) is important in petroleum geology because as much as 50% of the world's hydrocarbon reserves are hosted in carbonate rock, and much of this is found in porous karst systems.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe English word karst was borrowed from German Karst in the late 19th century, which entered German much earlier. According to one interpretation the term is derived from the German name for a number of geological, geomorphological, and hydrological features found within the range of the Dinaric Alps, stretching from the northeastern corner of Italy above the city of Trieste, across the Balkan peninsula along the coast of the eastern Adriatic to Kosovo and North Macedonia, where the massif of the \u0160ar Mountains begins, and more specifically the karst zone at the northwesternmost section, described in early topographical research as a plateau, between Italy and Slovenia.\nIn the local South Slavic languages, all variations of the word are derived from a Romanized Illyrian base (yielding Latin: carsus, Dalmatian: carsus), later metathesized from the reconstructed form *kors\u044a into forms such as Slovene: kras and Serbo-Croatian: kr\u0161, kras. Languages preserving the older, non-metathesized form include Italian: Carso, German: Karst, and Albanian: karsti; the lack of metathesis precludes borrowing from any of the South Slavic languages, specifically Slovene. The Slovene common noun kras was first attested in the 18th century, and the adjective form kra\u0161ki in the 16th century. As a proper noun, the Slovene form Grast was first attested in 1177.Ultimately, the word is of Mediterranean origin. It has been suggested that the word may derive from the Proto-Indo-European root karra- 'rock'. The name may also be connected to the oronym Kar(u)s\u00e1dios oros cited by Ptolemy, and perhaps also to Latin Carusardius.\n\n\n== Early studies ==\n\nJohann Weikhard von Valvasor, a pioneer of the study of karst in Slovenia and a fellow of the Royal Society for Improving Natural Knowledge, London, introduced the word karst to European scholars in 1689, describing the phenomenon of underground flows of rivers in his account of Lake Cerknica.Jovan Cviji\u0107 greatly advanced the knowledge of karst regions, so much that he became known as the \"father of karst geomorphology\". Primarily discussing the karstic regions of the Balkans, Cviji\u0107's 1893 publication Das Karstph\u00e4nomen describes landforms such as karren, dolines and poljes. In a 1918 publication, Cviji\u0107 proposed a cyclical model for karstic landscape development. Karst hydrology emerged as a discipline in the late 1950s and early 1960s in France. Previously, the activities of cave explorers, called speleologists, had been dismissed as more of a sport than a science, meaning that underground karstic caves and their associated watercourses were, from a scientific perspective, understudied.\n\n\n== Development ==\n\nKarst is most strongly developed in dense carbonate rock, such as limestone, that is thinly bedded and highly fractured.  Karst is not typically well developed in chalk, because chalk is highly porous rather than dense, so the flow of groundwater is not concentrated along fractures. Karst is also most strongly developed where the water table is relatively low, such as in uplands with entrenched valleys, and where rainfall is moderate to heavy. This contributes to rapid downward movement of groundwater, which promotes dissolution of the bedrock, whereas standing groundwater becomes saturated with carbonate minerals and ceases to dissolve the bedrock.\n\n\n=== Chemistry of dissolution ===\nThe carbonic acid that causes karstic features is formed as rain passes through Earth's atmosphere picking up carbon dioxide (CO2), which readily dissolves in the water. Once the rain reaches the ground, it may pass through soil that provides additional CO2 produced by soil respiration. Some of the dissolved carbon dioxide reacts with the water to form a weak carbonic acid solution, which dissolves calcium carbonate. The primary reaction sequence in limestone dissolution is the following:\n \nIn very rare conditions, oxidation can play a role. Oxidation played a major role in the formation of ancient Lechuguilla Cave in the US state of New Mexico and is presently active in the Frasassi Caves of Italy. The oxidation of sulfides leading to the formation of sulfuric acid can also be one of the corrosion factors in karst formation. As oxygen (O2)-rich surface waters seep into deep anoxic karst systems, they bring oxygen, which reacts with sulfide present in the system (pyrite or hydrogen sulfide) to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Sulfuric acid then reacts with calcium carbonate, causing increased erosion within the limestone formation. This chain of reactions is:\n\nThis reaction chain forms gypsum.\n\n\n== Morphology ==\n\nThe karstification of a landscape may result in a variety of large- or small-scale features both on the surface and beneath. On exposed surfaces, small features may include solution flutes (or rillenkarren), runnels, limestone pavement (clints and grikes), collectively called karren or lapiez. Medium-sized surface features may include sinkholes or cenotes (closed basins), vertical shafts, foibe (inverted funnel shaped sinkholes), disappearing streams, and reappearing springs. Large-scale features may include limestone pavements, poljes, and karst valleys. Mature karst landscapes, where more bedrock has been removed than remains, may result in karst towers, or haystack/eggbox landscapes. Beneath the surface, complex underground drainage systems (such as karst aquifers) and extensive caves and cavern systems may form.Erosion along limestone shores, notably in the tropics, produces karst topography that includes a sharp makatea surface above the normal reach of the sea, and undercuts that are mostly the result of biological activity or bioerosion at or a little above mean sea level. Some of the most dramatic of these formations can be seen in Thailand's Phangnga Bay and at Halong Bay in Vietnam.\nCalcium carbonate dissolved into water may precipitate out where the water discharges some of its dissolved carbon dioxide. Rivers which emerge from springs may produce tufa terraces, consisting of layers of calcite deposited over extended periods of time. In caves, a variety of features collectively called speleothems are formed by deposition of calcium carbonate and other dissolved minerals.\n\n\n== Hydrology ==\n\nFarming in karst areas must take into account the lack of surface water. The soils may be fertile enough, and rainfall may be adequate, but rainwater quickly moves through the crevices into the ground, sometimes leaving the surface soil parched between rains.\nA karst fenster (karst window) occurs when an underground stream emerges onto the surface between layers of rock, cascades some distance, and then disappears back down, often into a sinkhole. Rivers in karst areas may disappear underground a number of times and spring up again in different places, usually under a different name (like Ljubljanica, the river of seven names). An example of this is the Popo Agie River in Fremont County, Wyoming. At a site simply named \"The Sinks\" in Sinks Canyon State Park, the river flows into a cave in a formation known as the Madison Limestone and then rises again 800 m (1\u20442 mi) down the canyon in a placid pool. A turlough is a unique type of seasonal lake found in Irish karst areas which are formed through the annual welling-up of water from the underground water system.\nWater supplies from wells in karst topography may be unsafe, as the water may have run unimpeded from a sinkhole in a cattle pasture, through a cave and to the well, bypassing the normal filtering that occurs in a porous aquifer. Karst formations are cavernous and therefore have high rates of permeability, resulting in reduced opportunity for contaminants to be filtered. Groundwater in karst areas is just as easily polluted as surface streams. Sinkholes have often been used as farmstead or community trash dumps. Overloaded or malfunctioning septic tanks in karst landscapes may dump raw sewage directly into underground channels. Geologists are concerned with these negative effects of human activity on karst hydrology which, as of 2007, supplied about 25% of the global demand for drinkable water.The karst topography also poses difficulties for human inhabitants. Sinkholes can develop gradually as surface openings enlarge, but progressive erosion is frequently unseen until the roof of a cavern suddenly collapses. Such events have swallowed homes, cattle, cars, and farm machinery. In the United States, sudden collapse of such a cavern-sinkhole swallowed part of the collection of the National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Kentucky in 2014.\n\n\n== Interstratal karst ==\nInterstratal karst is a karstic landscape which is developed beneath a cover of insoluble rocks. Typically this will involve a cover of sandstone overlying limestone strata undergoing solution. In the United Kingdom for example extensive doline fields have developed at Cefn yr Ystrad, Mynydd Llangatwg and Mynydd Llangynidr in South Wales across a cover of Twrch Sandstone which overlies concealed Carboniferous Limestone, the last-named having been declared a site of special scientific interest in respect of it.\n\n\n== Kegelkarst ==\nKegelkarst is a type of tropical karst terrain with numerous cone-like hills, formed by cockpits, mogotes, and poljes and without strong fluvial erosion processes. This terrain is found in Cuba, Jamaica, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, southern China, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos and Vietnam.\n\n\n== Pseudokarst ==\nPseudokarsts are similar in form or appearance to karst features but are created by different mechanisms. Examples include lava caves and granite tors\u2014for example, Labertouche Cave in Victoria, Australia\u2014and paleocollapse features. Mud Caves are an example of pseudokarst.\n\n\n== Paleokarst ==\nPaleokarst or palaeokarst is a development of karst observed in geological history and preserved within the rock sequence, effectively a fossil karst. There are for example palaeokarstic surfaces exposed within the Clydach Valley Subgroup of the Carboniferous Limestone sequence of South Wales which developed as sub-aerial weathering of recently formed limestones took place during periods of non-deposition within the early part of the period. Sedimentation resumed and further limestone strata were deposited on an irregular karstic surface, the cycle recurring several times in connection with fluctuating sea levels over prolonged periods.\n\n\n== Karst forest ==\nKarst areas tend to have unique types of forests. The karst terrain is difficult for humans to traverse, so that their ecosystems are often relatively undisturbed. The soil tends to have a high pH, which encourages growth of unusual species of orchids, palms, mangroves and other plants.\n\n\n== Karst areas ==\n\nThe world's largest limestone karst is Australia's Nullarbor Plain. Slovenia has the world's highest risk of sinkholes, while the western Highland Rim in the eastern United States is at the second-highest risk of karst sinkholes.In Canada, Wood Buffalo National Park, NWT contains areas of karst sinkholes.Mexico hosts important karstic regions in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and Chiapas.The South China Karst in the provinces of Guizhou, Guangxi, and Yunnan provinces is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe Tham Luang Nang Non karstic cave system in northern Thailand was made famous by the 2018 rescue of a junior football team.\n\n\n== List of terms for karst-related features ==\n\nAb\u00eeme, a vertical shaft in karst that may be very deep and usually opens into a network of subterranean passages\nCenote, a deep sinkhole, characteristic of Mexico, resulting from collapse of limestone bedrock that exposes groundwater underneath\nDoline, also sink or sinkhole, is a closed depression draining underground in karst areas. The name \"doline\" comes from dolina, meaning \"valley\", and derives from South Slavic languages.\nFoibe, an inverted funnel-shaped sinkhole\nKarst window (also known as a \"karst fenster\"), a feature where a spring emerges briefly, with the water discharge then abruptly disappearing into a nearby sinkhole\nKarst spring, a spring emerging from karst, originating a flow of water on the surface\nLimestone pavement, a landform consisting of a flat, incised surface of exposed limestone that resembles an artificial pavement\nLosing stream, sinking river or ponornica in South Slavic languages.\nPolje (karst polje, karst field), a large flat specifically karstic plain. The name \"polje\" derives from South Slavic languages.\nPonor, same as estavelle, sink or sinkhole in South Slavic languages, where surface flow enters an underground system\nScowle, porous irregular karstic landscape in a region of England.\nTurlough (turlach), a type of disappearing lake characteristic of Irish karst.\nUvala, a collection of multiple smaller individual sinkholes that coalesce into a compound sinkhole. The term derives from South Slavic languages (many karst-related terms derive from South Slavic languages, entering scientific vocabulary through early research in the Western Balkan Dinaric Alpine karst).\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nFord, D.C., Williams, P., Karst Hydrogeology and Geomorphology, John Wiley and Sons Ltd., 2007, ISBN 978-0-470-84996-5\nJennings, J.N., Karst Geomorphology, 2nd ed., Blackwell, 1985, ISBN 0-631-14032-8\nPalmer, A.N., Cave Geology, 2nd Printing, Cave Books, 2009, ISBN 978-0-939748-66-2\nSweeting, M.M., Karst Landforms, Macmillan, 1973, ISBN 0-231-03623-X\nvan Beynen, P.
