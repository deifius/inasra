During her husband's third term as president from 1973 to 1974, she served as both Vice President and First Lady of Argentina. Following her husband's death in office in 1974, she served as President for almost two years before the military took over the government. Per\u00f3n was then placed under house arrest for five years before exiled to Spain in 1981.\nIn 2007 an Argentine judge ordered Per\u00f3n's arrest over the forced disappearance of an activist in February 1976, on the grounds that the disappearance was authorized by her signing of decrees allowing Argentina's armed forces to take action against \"subversives\". She was arrested near her home in Spain on 12 January 2007. Spanish courts subsequently refused her extradition to Argentina.Since the death of Carlos Menem, on 14 February 2021, Per\u00f3n is the oldest living former Argentine president.\n\n"
