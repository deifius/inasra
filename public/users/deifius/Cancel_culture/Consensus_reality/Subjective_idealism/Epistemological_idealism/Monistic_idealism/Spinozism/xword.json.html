(also spelled Spinozaism) is the monist philosophical system of Baruch Spinoza that defines \"God\" as a singular self-subsistent substance, with both matter and thought being attributes of such.In a letter to Henry Oldenburg, Spinoza wrote: \"as to the view of certain people that I identify god with nature (taken as a kind of mass or corporeal matter), they are quite mistaken\". For Spinoza, our universe (cosmos) is a mode under infinite attributes, of which we can perceive two: Thought and Extension. God has infinitely many other attributes which are not present in our world. According to German philosopher Karl Jaspers, when Spinoza wrote \"Deus sive Natura\" (\"God or Nature\") Spinoza meant God was Natura naturans not Natura naturata, that is, \"a dynamic nature in action, growing and changing, not a passive or static thing.\"\n\n\n== Core doctrine ==\nSpinoza's metaphysics consists of one thing, Substance, and its modifications (modes). Early in The Ethics Spinoza argues that there is only one Substance, which is absolutely infinite, self-caused, and eternal. Substance causes an infinite number of attributes (the intellect perceiving an abstract concept or essence) and modes (things following from attributes and modes). He calls this Substance \"God\", or \"Nature\". In fact, he takes these two terms to be synonymous (in the Latin the phrase he uses is \"Deus sive Natura\"), but readers often disregard his neutral monism. During his time, this statement was seen as literally equating the existing world with God - for which he was accused of atheism. Spinoza asserted that the whole of the natural universe is made of one Substance \u2013 God or Nature \u2013 and its modifications (modes).\n\nIt cannot be overemphasized how the rest of Spinoza's philosophy, his philosophy of mind, epistemology, psychology, moral philosophy, political philosophy, and philosophy of religion \u2013 flows more or less directly from the metaphysical underpinnings in Part I of the Ethics.\nOne should, however, remember the neutral monist position. While the natural universe humans experience in the realm of mind and physical reality is part of God, it is only two attributes \u2013 thought and extension \u2013 that are part of infinite attributes emanating from God.\nSpinoza's doctrine was considered radical at the time he published, and he was widely seen as the most infamous atheist-heretic of Europe. His philosophy was part of the philosophic debate in Europe during the Enlightenment, along with Cartesianism. Specifically, Spinoza disagreed with Descartes on substance duality, Descartes' views on the will and the intellect, and the subject of free will.In Spinozism, the concept of a personal relationship with God comes from the position that one is a part of an infinite interdependent \"organism.\" Spinoza argued that everything is a derivative of God, interconnected with all of existence. Although humans experience only thought and extension, what happens to one aspect of existence will affect others. Thus, Spinozism teaches a form of determinism and ecology, and uses these as a basis for morality.Additionally, a core doctrine of Spinozism is that the universe is essentially deterministic. All that happens or will happen could not have unfolded in any other way. Spinoza claimed that the third kind of knowledge, intuition, is the highest kind. More specifically, he defined intuition as the ability of the human intellect to intuit knowledge based upon its accumulated understanding of the world.\n\n\n=== Substance ===\nSpinoza defines \"Substance\" as follows:\n\nBy substance I understand what is in itself and is conceived through itself, i.e., that whose concept does not require the concept of another thing, from which it must be formed. (E1D3)\nThis means, essentially, that Substance is just whatever can be thought of without relating it to any other idea or thing. For example, if one thinks of a particular object, one thinks of it as a kind of thing, e.g., x is a cat. Substance, on the other hand, is to be conceived of by itself, without understanding it as a particular kind of thing, because it is not a particular thing.\n\n\n=== Attributes ===\nSpinoza defines \"attribute\" as follows:\n\nBy attribute I understand what the intellect perceives of a substance, as constituting its essence. (E1D4)\nFrom this it can be seen that Attributes are related to Substance. It is not clear, however, even from Spinoza's direct definition, whether, a) Attributes are really the way(s) Substance is, or b) Attributes are simply ways to understand Substance, but not necessarily the ways it really is.\nSpinoza thinks that there are an infinite number of Attributes, but there are two Attributes for which Spinoza thinks we can have knowledge. Namely, thought and extension.\n\n\n==== Thought ====\nThe attribute of thought is how Substance can be understood to be composed of thoughts, i.e., thinking things. When we understand a particular thing through the Attribute of thought, we are understanding the mode as an idea of something (either another idea, or an object).\n\n\n==== Extension ====\nThe Attribute of extension is how Substance can be understood to be physically extended in space. Particular things that occupy space are what is meant by extended. It follows from this that if Substance and God are identical, in Spinoza's view, and contrary to the traditional conception, God has extension as one of his Attributes.\n\n\n=== Modes ===\nModes are particular modifications of substance, i.e., particular things in the world. Spinoza gives the following definition:\n\nBy mode I understand the affections of a substance, or that which is in another through which it is also conceived. (E1D5)\n\n\n=== Substance monism ===\nThe argument for there only being one Substance (or, more colloquially, one kind of stuff) in the universe occurs in the first fourteen propositions of The Ethics. The following proposition expresses Spinoza's commitment to substance monism:\n\nExcept God, no substance can be or be conceived. (E1P14)\nSpinoza takes this proposition to follow directly from everything he says prior to it. Spinoza's monism is contrasted with Descartes' dualism and Leibniz's pluralism. Thus, Spinoza avoids the unsolvable problem of how mind and body interact, which troubled Descartes in his Meditations on First Philosophy. Specifically, how can immaterial mind interface with material body, and vice-versa? They exist in wholly different categories.\n\n\n=== Causality and modality ===\nThe issue of causality and modality (possibility and necessity) in Spinoza's philosophy is contentious. Spinoza's philosophy is, in one sense, thoroughly deterministic (or necessitarian). This can be seen directly from Axiom 3 of The Ethics:\n\nFrom a given determinate cause the effect follows necessarily; and conversely, if there is no determinate cause, it is impossible for an effect to follow. (E1A3)\nYet Spinoza seems to make room for a kind of freedom, especially in the fifth and final section of The Ethics, \"On the Power of the Intellect, or on Human Freedom\":\n\nI pass now to the remaining Part of the Ethics, which concerns the means or way to Freedom. Here, then, I shall treat of the power of reason, showing what it can do against the affects, and what Freedom of Mind, or blessedness, is. (E5, Preface)\nSo Spinoza certainly has a use for the word 'freedom', but he equates \"Freedom of Mind\" with \"blessedness\", a notion which is not traditionally associated with freedom of the will at all.\n\n\n==== The principle of sufficient reason (PSR) ====\nAlthough the PSR is most commonly associated with Gottfried Leibniz, it is arguably found in its strongest form in Spinoza's philosophy. Within the context of Spinoza's philosophical system, the PSR can be understood to unify causation and explanation. What this means is that for Spinoza, questions regarding the reason why a given phenomenon is the way it is (or exists) are always answerable, and are always answerable in terms of the relevant cause(s). This constitutes a rejection of teleological, or final causation, except possibly in a more restricted sense for human beings. Given this, Spinoza's views regarding causality and modality begin to make much more sense.\n\n\n=== Parallelism ===\nSpinoza's philosophy contains as a key proposition the notion that mental and physical (thought and extension) phenomena occur in parallel, but without causal interaction between them. He expresses this proposition as follows:\n\nThe order and connection of ideas is the same as the order and connection of things. (E2P7)\nHis proof of this proposition is that:\n\nThe knowledge of an effect depends on, and involves, the knowledge of its cause. (E1A4)\nThe reason Spinoza thinks parallelism follows from this axiom is that, since the idea we have of each thing requires knowledge of its cause, such a cause must be understood under the same attribute. Further, there is only one substance, so whenever we understand some chain of ideas concerning things, we understand that the way the ideas are causally related must be the same as the way the things themselves are related, since the ideas and the things are both God's modes, but pertain to different attributes.\n\n\n== Pantheism controversy ==\n\nIn 1785, Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi published a condemnation of Spinoza's pantheism, after Gotthold Ephraim Lessing was thought to have confessed on his deathbed to being a \"Spinozist\", which was the equivalent in his time of being called a heretic. Jacobi claimed that Spinoza's doctrine was pure materialism, because all Nature and God are said to be nothing but extended substance. This, for Jacobi, was the result of Enlightenment rationalism and it would finally end in absolute atheism. Moses Mendelssohn disagreed with Jacobi, saying that there is no actual difference between theism and pantheism. The entire issue became a major intellectual and religious concern for European civilization at the time, which Immanuel Kant rejected, as he thought that attempts to conceive of transcendent reality would lead to antinomies (statements that could be proven both right and wrong) in thought.\nThe attraction of Spinoza's philosophy to late eighteenth-century Europeans was that it provided an alternative to materialism, atheism, and deism. Three of Spinoza's ideas strongly appealed to them:\n\nthe unity of all that exists;\nthe regularity of all that happens; and\nthe identity of spirit and nature.For intellectuals of the time, it was also much safer to be a Spinozist than to openly identify as an atheist or a deist, as these things were often criminally punishable and at the very least, would guarantee one's social ostracism.Spinoza's \"God or Nature\" [Deus sive Natura] provided a living, natural God, in contrast to the Newtonian mechanical \"First Cause\" or the dead mechanism of the French \"Man Machine.\" Coleridge and Shelley saw in Spinoza's philosophy a religion of nature  and called him the \"God-intoxicated Man.\" Spinoza inspired the poet Shelley to write his essay \"The Necessity of Atheism.\"Spinoza was considered to be an atheist because he used the word \"God\" [Deus] to signify a concept that was different from that of traditional Judeo\u2013Christian monotheism. \"Spinoza expressly denies personality and consciousness to God; he has neither intelligence, feeling, nor will; he does not act according to purpose, but everything follows necessarily from his nature, according to law....\" Thus, Spinoza's cool, indifferent God differs from the concept of an anthropomorphic, fatherly God who cares about humanity.\n\n\n== Modern interpretations ==\nGerman philosopher Karl Jaspers believed that Spinoza, in his philosophical system, did not mean to say that God and Nature are interchangeable terms, but rather that God's transcendence was attested by his infinitely many attributes, and that two attributes known by humans, namely Thought and Extension, signified God's immanence. Even God under the attributes of thought and extension cannot be identified strictly with our world. That world is of course \"divisible\"; it has parts. But Spinoza insists that \"no attribute of a substance can be truly conceived from which it follows that the substance can be divided\" (Which means that one cannot conceive an attribute in a way that leads to division of substance), and that \"a substance which is absolutely infinite is indivisible\" (Ethics, Part I, Propositions 12 and 13). Following this logic, our world should be considered as a mode under two attributes of thought and extension. Therefore, the pantheist formula \"One and All\" would apply to Spinoza only if the \"One\" preserves its transcendence and the \"All\" were not interpreted as the totality of finite things.French philosopher Martial Gu\u00e9roult suggested the term \"panentheism\", rather than \"pantheism\" to describe Spinoza's view of the relation between God and the world. The world is not God, but it is, in a strong sense, \"in\" God. Not only do finite things have God as their cause; they cannot be conceived without God. In other words, the world is a subset of God. American philosopher Charles Hartshorne, on the other hand, suggested the term \"Classical Pantheism\" to describe Spinoza's philosophy.\nIn 1978 the British philosopher Charles Jarrett published one of the first formalizations of the first part of the Spinoza's Ethics, which used a mix of first-order logic and modal logic in S5.Speculative realism, a movement in post-continental philosophy, is highly indebted to spinozaist metaphysics.\n\n\n== Comparison to Eastern philosophies ==\nSimilarities between Spinoza's philosophy and Eastern philosophical traditions have been discussed by many authorities. The 19th-century German Sanskritist Theodore Goldst\u00fccker was one of the early figures to notice the similarities between Spinoza's religious conceptions and the Vedanta tradition of India, writing that Spinoza's thought was \"... a western system of philosophy which occupies a foremost rank amongst the philosophies of all nations and ages, and which is so exact a representation of the ideas of the Vedanta, that we might have suspected its founder to have borrowed the fundamental principles of his system from the Hindus, did his biography not satisfy us that he was wholly unacquainted with their doctrines... We mean the philosophy of Spinoza, a man whose very life is a picture of that moral purity and intellectual indifference to the transitory charms of this world, which is the constant longing of the true Vedanta philosopher... comparing the fundamental ideas of both we should have no difficulty in proving that, had Spinoza been a Hindu, his system would in all probability mark a last phase of the Vedanta philosophy.\"It has also been said that Spinozism is similar to the Hindu doctrines of Samkhya and Yoga. Although within the various existing Indian traditions there exist many traditions which astonishingly had such similar doctrines from ages, out of which most similar and well known are the Kashmiri Shaivism and Nath tradition, apart from already existing Samkhya and Yoga.Max Muller, in his lectures, noted the striking similarities between Vedanta and the system of Spinoza, saying \"the Brahman, as conceived in the Upanishads and defined by Sankara, is clearly the same as Spinoza's 'Substantia'.\" Helena Blavatsky, a founder of the Theosophical Society also compared Spinoza's religious thought to Vedanta, writing in an unfinished essay \"As to Spinoza's Deity \u2013 natura naturans \u2013 conceived in his attributes simply and alone; and the same Deity \u2013 as natura naturata or as conceived in the endless series of modifications or correlations, the direct outflowing results from the properties of these attributes, it is the Vedantic Deity pure and simple.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nPhilosophy of Spinoza\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nJonathan I.

According to German philosopher Karl Jaspers, when Spinoza wrote \"Deus sive Natura\" (\"God or Nature\") Spinoza meant God was Natura naturans not Natura naturata, that is, \"a dynamic nature in action, growing and changing, not a passive or static thing.\""}, "Zurvanism": {"links": ["Cypress of Kashmar", "Spiritualism", "Mysticism", "Yazdegerd I", "Ferdowsi", "Cronus", "Materialist",

"Zurvanism is a hypothetical religious movement of Zoroastrianism in which the divinity Zurvan is a First Principle (primordial creator deity) who engendered equal-but-opposite twins, Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu. Zurvanism is also known as \"Zurvanite Zoroastrianism\", and may be contrasted with Mazdaism.\nIn Zurvanism, Zurvan was perceived as the god of infinite time and space and was aka (\"one\", \"alone\"). Zurvan was portrayed as a transcendental and neutral god, without passion, and one for whom there was no distinction between good or evil. The name Zurvan is a normalized rendition of the word, which in Middle Persian appears as either Zurv\u0101n, Zruv\u0101n or Zarv\u0101n. The Middle Persian name derives from  Avestan zruvan-, \"time\", which is grammatically without gender.\n\n\n== Origins and background ==\nAlthough the details of the origin and development of Zurvanism remain murky (for a summary of the three opposing opinions, see Ascent and acceptance below), it is generally accepted that Zurvanism was a branch of greater Zoroastrianism;:\u200a\u202f157\u2013304\u200a that the doctrine of Zurvan was a sacerdotal response to resolve a perceived inconsistency in the sacred texts:\u200aintro\u200a (see \u00a7 The \"twin brother\" doctrine below); and that this doctrine was probably introduced during the second half of the Achaemenid era.:\u200a\u202f157\u2013304\u200aZurvanism enjoyed royal sanction during the Sassanid era (226\u2013651 CE) but no traces of it remain beyond the 10th century. Although Sassanid-era Zurvanism was certainly influenced by Hellenic philosophy, the relationship between it and the Greek divinity of Time (Chronos) has not been conclusively established. Non-Zoroastrian accounts of typically Zurvanite beliefs were the first traces of Zoroastrianism to reach the west, leading European scholars to conclude that Zoroastrianism was a monist religion, an issue of controversy among both scholars and contemporary practitioners of the faith.\nThe word appears in Sanskrit as sarva and the etymology of the Sarvastivada Buddhist sect suggests a connection to both Zurvan and Zoroaster.\n\n\n== Evidence of the cult ==\nThe earliest evidence of the cult of Zurvan is found in the History of Theology, attributed to Eudemus of Rhodes (c. 370\u2013300 BCE). As cited in Damascius's Difficulties and Solutions of First Principles (6th century CE), Eudemus describes a sect of the Medes that considered Space/Time to be the primordial \"father\" of the rivals Oromasdes \"of light\" and Arimanius \"of darkness\".:\u200a\u202f331\u2013332\u200aThe principal evidence for Zurvanite doctrine occurs in the polemical Christian tracts of Armenian and Syriac writers of the Sassanid period (224\u2013651 CE). Indigenous sources of information from the same period are the 3rd century Kartir inscription at Ka'ba-i Zartosht and the early 4th century edict of Mihr-Narse (head-priest under Yazdegerd I), the latter being the only native evidence from the Sassanid period that is frankly Zurvanite. The post-Sassanid Zoroastrian Middle Persian commentaries are primarily Mazdean and with only one exception (10th century Denkard 9.30) do not mention Zurvan at all. Of the remaining so-called Pahlavi texts only two, the M\u0113n\u014dg-i Khrad and the Selections of Zatspram (both 9th century) reveal a Zurvanite tendency. The latter, in which the priest Zatspram chastises his brother's un-Mazdaean ideas, is the last text in Middle Persian that provides any evidence of the cult of Zurvan. The 13th century Zoroastrian Ulema-i Islam ([Response] to Doctors of Islam), a New Persian apologetic text, is unambiguously Zurvanite and is also the last direct evidence of Zurvan as a First Principle.\nThere is no hint of any worship of Zurvan in any of the texts of the Avesta, even though the texts (as they exist today) are the result of a Sassanid era redaction. Zaehner proposes that this is because the individual Sassanid monarchs were not always Zurvanite and that Mazdean Zoroastrianism just happened to have the upper hand during the crucial period that the canon was finally written down.:\u200a\u202f48\u200a:\u200a\u202f108\u200a In the texts composed prior to the Sassanid period, Zurvan appears twice, as both an abstract concept and as a minor divinity, but there is no evidence of a cult. In Yasna 72.10 Zurvan is invoked in the company of Space and Air (Vata-Vayu) and in Yasht 13.56, the plants grow in the manner Time has ordained according to the will of Ahura Mazda and the Amesha Spentas. Two other references to Zurvan are also present in the Vendidad, but although these are late additions to the canon, they again do not establish any evidence of a cult. Zurvan does not appear in any listing of the Yazatas.\n\n\n== History and development ==\n\n\n=== Ascent and acceptance ===\nThe origins of the cult of Zurvan remain debated. One view:\u200aintro\u200a considers Zurvanism to have developed out of Zoroastrianism as a reaction to the liberalization of the late Achaemenid-era form of the faith. Another view proposes that Zurvan existed as a pre-Zoroastrian divinity that was incorporated into Zoroastrianism. The third view is that Zurvanism is the product of the contact between Zoroastrianism and Babylonian\u2013Akkadian religions (for a summary of opposing views see Boyce:\u200a\u202f304\u200a).\nCertain however is that by the Sassanid era (226\u2013651 CE), the divinity \"Infinite Time\" was well established, and \u2013 as inferred from a Manichaean text presented to Shapur I, in which the name Zurvan was adopted for Manichaeism's primordial \"Father of Greatness\" \u2013 enjoyed royal patronage. It was during the reign of Sassanid Emperor Shapur I (241\u2013272 CE) that Zurvanism appears to have developed as a cult and it was presumably in this period that Greek and Indic concepts were introduced to Zurvanite Zoroastrianism.\nIt is however not known whether Sassanid-era Zurvanism and Mazdaism were separate sects, each with their own organization and priesthood, or simply two tendencies within the same body. That Mazdaism and Zurvanism competed for attention has been inferred from the works of Christian and Manichaean polemicists, but the doctrinal incompatibilities were not so extreme \"that they could not be reconciled under the broad aegis of an imperial church\".:\u200a\u202f30\u200a More likely is that the two sects served different segments of Sassanid society, with dispassionate Zurvanism primarily operating as a mystic cult and passionate Mazdaism serving the community at large.\n\n\n=== Decline and disappearance ===\n\nFollowing the fall of the Sassanid Empire in the 7th century, Zoroastrianism was gradually supplanted by Islam. The former continued to exist but in an increasingly reduced state, and by the 10th century the remaining Zoroastrians appear to have more closely followed the orthodoxy as found in the Pahlavi books (see also \u00a7 The legacy of Zurvanism below).\nWhy the cult of Zurvan vanished while Mazdaism did not remains an issue of scholarly debate. Arthur Christensen, one of the first proponents of the theory that Zurvanism was the state religion of the Sassanids, suggested that the rejection of Zurvanism in the post-conquest epoch was a response and reaction to the new authority of Islamic monotheism that brought about a deliberate reform of Zoroastrianism that aimed to establish a stronger orthodoxy.:\u200a\u202f305\u200a Zaehner is of the opinion that the Zurvanite priesthood had a \"strict orthodoxy which few could tolerate. Moreover, they interpreted the Prophet's message so dualistically that their God was made to appear very much less than all-powerful and all-wise. Reasonable as so absolute a dualism might appear from a purely intellectual point of view, it had neither the appeal of a real monotheism nor had it any mystical element with which to nourish its inner life.\"Another possible explanation postulated by Boyce:\u200a\u202f308\u2013309\u200a is that Mazdaism and Zurvanism were divided regionally, that is, with Mazdaism being the predominant tendency in the regions to the north and east (Bactria, Margiana, and other satrapies closest to Zoroaster's homeland), while Zurvanism was prominent in regions to the south and west (closer to Babylonian and Greek influence). This is supported by Manichaean evidence that indicates that 3rd century Mazdean Zoroastrianism had its stronghold in Parthia, to the northeast. Following the fall of the Persian Empire, the south and west were relatively quickly assimilated under the banner of Islam, while the north and east remained independent for some time before these regions too were absorbed.:\u200a\u202f308\u2013309\u200a This could also explain why Armenian/Syriac observations reveal a distinctly Zurvanite Zoroastrianism, and inversely, could explain the strong Greek and Babylonian connection and interaction with Zurvanism (see \u00a7 Types of Zurvanism below).\n\n\n== The \"twin brother\" doctrine ==\n\"Classical Zurvanism\" is a term coined by Zaehner:\u200aintro\u200a to denote the movement to explain the inconsistency of Zoroaster's description of the \"twin spirits\" as they appear in Yasna 30.3\u20135 of the Avesta. According to Zaehner, this \"Zurvanism proper\" was\n\ngenuinely Iranian and Zoroastrian in that it sought to clarify the enigma of the twin spirits that Zoroaster left unsolved.\nAs the priesthood sought to explain it, if the Malevolent Spirit (lit: Angra Mainyu) and the Benevolent Spirit (Spenta Mainyu, identified with Ahura Mazda) were twins, then they must have had a parent, who must have existed before them. The priesthood settled on Zurvan \u2013 the hypostasis of (Infinite) Time \u2013 as being \"the only possible 'Absolute' from whom the twins could proceed\" and which was the source of good in the one and the source of evil in the other.The Zurvanite \"twin brother\" doctrine is also evident in Zurvanism's cosmogonical creation myth; the classic form of the creation myth does not contradict the Mazdean model of the origin and evolution of the universe, which begins where the Zurvanite model ends. It may well be that the Zurvanite cosmogony was an adaptation of an antecedent Hellenic Chronos cosmogony that portrayed Infinite Time as the \"Father of Time\" (not to be confused with the Titan Cronus, father of Zeus) whom the Greeks equated with Oromasdes, i.e. Ohrmuzd / Ahura Mazda.\n\n\n=== Creation story ===\nThe classic Zurvanite model of creation, preserved only by non-Zoroastrian sources, proceeds as follows:\n\nIn the beginning, the great God Zurvan existed alone. Desiring offspring that would create \"heaven and hell and everything in between\", Zurvan sacrificed for a thousand years. Towards the end of this period, androgyne Zurvan began to doubt the efficacy of sacrifice and in the moment of this doubt Ohrmuzd and Ahriman were conceived: Ohrmuzd for the sacrifice and Ahriman for the doubt. Upon realizing that twins were to be born, Zurvan resolved to grant the first-born sovereignty over creation. Ohrmuzd perceived Zurvan's decision, which He then communicated to His brother. Ahriman then preempted Ohrmuzd by ripping open the womb to emerge first. Reminded of the resolution to grant Ahriman sovereignty, Zurvan conceded, but limited kingship to a period of 9,000 years, after which Ohrmuzd would rule for all eternity.:\u200a\u202f419\u2013428\u200a\nChristian and Manichaean missionaries considered this doctrine to be exemplary of the Zoroastrian faith and it was these and similar texts that first reached the west. Corroborated by Anquetil-Duperron's \"erroneous rendering\" of Vendidad 19.9, these led to the late 18th century conclusion that Infinite Time was the first Principle of Zoroastrianism and Ohrmuzd was therefore only \"the derivative and secondary character\". Ironically, the fact that no Zoroastrian texts contained any hint of the born-of-Zurvan doctrine was considered to be evidence of a latter-day corruption of the original principles. The opinion that Zoroastrianism was so severely dualistic that it was, in fact, ditheistic or even tritheistic would be widely held until the late 19th century.:\u200a\u202f490\u2013492\u200a:\u200a\u202f687\u200a\n\n\n== Types of Zurvanism ==\nAccording to Zaehner, the doctrine of the cult of Zurvan appears to have three schools of thought, each to a different degree influenced by alien philosophies, which he calls\n\nmaterialist Zurvanism,\naesthetic Zurvanism, and\nfatalistic Zurvanism.These are described in the following subsections. Zaehner proposes that each of three arose out of\n\nclassical Zurvanismdescribed above.\n\n\n=== Materialist Zurvanism ===\nMaterialist Zurvanism was influenced by the Aristotelian and Empedoclean view of matter, and took \"some very queer forms\".While Zoroaster's Ormuzd created the universe with his thought, materialist Zurvanism challenged the concept that anything could be made out of nothing. This challenge was a patently alien idea, discarding core Zoroastrian tenets in favor of the position that the spiritual world \u2013 including heaven and hell, reward and punishment \u2013 did not exist.\nThe fundamental division of the material and spiritual is not altogether foreign to the Avesta; Geti and Mainyu (middle Persian: menog) are terms in Mazdaist tradition, where Ahura Mazda is said to have created all first in its spiritual, then later in its material form. But the material Zurvanites redefined menog to suit Aristotelian principles to mean \"that which did not (yet) have matter\", or alternatively, \"that which was still the unformed primal matter\". Even this is not necessarily a violation of orthodox Zoroastrian tradition, since the divinity Vayu is present in the middle space between Ormuzd and Ahriman, the void separating the kingdoms of light and darkness.\n\n\n=== Ascetic Zurvanism ===\nAscetic Zurvanism, which was apparently not as popular as the materialistic kind, viewed Zurvan as undifferentiated Time, which, under the influence of desire, divided into reason (a male principle) and concupiscence (a female principle).\nAccording to Duchesne-Guillemin, this division is \"redolent of Gnosticism or \u2013 still better \u2013 of Indian cosmology\". The parallels between Zurvan and Prajapati of Rig Veda 10.129 had been taken by Widengren to be evidence of a proto-Indo-Iranian Zurvan, but these arguments have since been dismissed. Nonetheless, there is a semblance of Zurvanite elements in Vedic texts, and, as Zaehner puts it, \"Time, for the Indians, is the raw material, the materia prima of all contingent being.\"\n\n\n=== Fatalistic Zurvanism ===\nThe doctrine of Limited Time (allotted to Ahriman by Zurvan) implied that nothing could change this preordained course of the material universe, and the path of the astral bodies of the 'heavenly sphere' was representative of this preordained course. It followed that human destiny must then be decided by the constellations, stars and planets, who were divided between the good (the signs of the Zodiac) and the evil (the planets):\n\nOhrmazd allotted happiness to man, but if man did not receive it, it was owing to the extortion of these planets.\nFatalistic Zurvanism was evidently influenced by Chaldean astrology and perhaps also by Aristotle's theory of chance and fortune. The fact that Armenian and Syrian commentators translated Zurvan as \"Fate\" is highly suggestive.\n\n\n== Mistaken identity ==\nIn his first manuscript of his book Zurvan, Zaehner identified the leontocephalic deity of the Roman Mithraic Mysteries as a representation of Zurvan. Zaehner later acknowledged this mis-identification as a \"positive mistake\", due to Franz Cumont's late 19th century notion that the Roman cult was \"Roman Mazdaism\" transmitted to the west by Iranian priests. Mithraic scholars no longer follow this so-called 'continuity theory', but that has not stopped the fallacy (which Zaehner also attributes to Cumont) from proliferating on the Internet.\n\n\n== The legacy of Zurvanism ==\nNo evidence of distinctly Zurvanite rituals or practices have been discovered, so followers of the cult are widely believed to have had the same rituals and practices as Mazdean Zoroastrians did. This is understandable, inasmuch as the Zurvanite doctrine of a monist First Principle did not preclude the worship of Ohrmuzd as the Creator (of the good creation). Similarly, no explicitly Zurvanite elements appear to have survived in modern Zoroastrianism, though Western influences have encouraged monotheistic theologies among some modern Zoroastrian reformists that replace the omniscient (but not omnipotent) Mazda with a new doctrine of an omnipotent Mazda that is more like the omnipotent and more strictly monotheistic deities of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam:\n\nDhalla explicitly accepted a modern Western version of the old Zurvanite heresy, according to which Ahura Mazda himself was the hypothetical 'father' of the twin Spirits of Y 30.3 ... Yet though Dhalla thus, under foreign influences, abandoned the fundamental doctrine of the absolute separation of good and evil, his book still breathes the sturdy, unflinching spirit of orthodox Zoroastrian dualism.\nZurvanism begins with a heterodox interpretation of Zarathushtra's Gathas:\n\nYes, there are two fundamental spirits, twins which are renowned to be in conflict. In thought and in word, in action they are two: the good and the bad.\nThen shall I speak of the two primal Spirits of existence, of whom the Very Holy thus spoke to the Evil One: \"Neither our thoughts nor teachings nor wills, neither or words nor choices nor acts, not our inner selves nor our souls agree.\"\nA literal, anthropomorphic \"twin brother\" interpretation of these passages gave rise to a need to postulate a father for the postulated literal \"brothers\". Hence Zurvanism postulated a preceding parent deity that existed above the good and evil of his sons. This was an obvious usurpation of Zoroastrian dualism, a sacrilege against the moral preeminence of Ahura Mazda.The pessimism evident in fatalistic Zurvanism existed in stark contradiction to the positive moral force of Mazdaism, and was a direct violation of one of Zoroaster's great contributions to religious philosophy: his uncompromising doctrine of free will. In Yasna 30.2 and 45.9, Ahura Mazda \"has left to men's wills\" to choose between doing good and doing evil. By leaving destiny in the hands of fate (an omnipotent deity), the cult of Zurvan distanced itself from the most sacred of Zoroastrian tenets: that of the efficacy of good thoughts, good words and good deeds.\nThat the Zurvanite view of creation was an apostasy even for medieval Zoroastrians is apparent from the 10th century Denkard, which in a commentary on Yasna 30.3\u20135 turns what the Zurvanites considered the words of the prophet into Zoroaster recalling \"a proclamation of the Demon of Envy to mankind that Ohrmuzd and Ahriman were two in one womb\".:\u200a9.30.4\u200aThe fundamental goal of \"classical Zurvanism\" to bring the doctrine of the \"twin spirits\" in accord with what was otherwise understood of Zoroaster's teaching may have been excessive, but (according to Zaehner) it was not altogether misguided. In noting the emergence of an overtly dualistic doctrine during the Sassanid period, Zaehner asserted that \n\n[There must] have been a party within the Zoroastrian community which regarded the strict dualism between Truth and the Lie, the Holy Spirit and the Destructive Spirit, as being the essence of the Prophet's message. Otherwise the re-emergence of this strictly dualist form of Zoroastrianism some six centuries after the collapse of the Achaemenian Empire could not be readily explained. There must have been a zealous minority that busied itself with defining what they considered the Prophet's true message to be; there must have been an 'orthodox' party within the 'Church'.\nThis minority, concerned now with theology no less than with ritual, would be found among the Magi, and it is, in fact, to the Magi that Aristotle and other early Greek writers attribute the fully dualist doctrine of two independent principles \u2013 Oromasdes and Areimanios. Further, the founder of the Magian order was now said to be Zoroaster himself. The fall of the Achaemenian Empire, however, must have been disastrous for the Zoroastrian religion, and the fact that the Magi were able to retain as much as they did and restore it in a form that was not too strikingly different from the Prophet's original message after the lapse of some 600 years proves their devotion to his memory. It is, indeed, true to say that the Zoroastrian orthodoxy of the Sassanian period is nearer to the spirit of Zoroaster than is the thinly disguised polytheism of the Yashts. \nThus \u2013 according to Zaehner \u2013 while the direction that the Sassanids took was not altogether at odds with the spirit of the Gathas, the extreme dualism that accompanied a divinity that was remote and inaccessible made the faith less than attractive. Zurvanism was then truly heretical only in the sense that it weakened the appeal of Zoroastrianism.\nNonetheless, that Zurvanism was the predominant brand of Zoroastrianism during the cataclysmic years just prior to the fall of the empire, is, according to Duchesne-Guillemin, evident in the degree of influence that Zurvanism (but not Mazdaism) would have on the Iranian brand of Shi'a Islam. Writing in the historical present, he notes that \"under Chosrau II (r. 590\u2013628) and his successors, all kinds of superstitions tend to overwhelm the Mazdean religion, which gradually disintegrates, thus preparing the triumph of Islam.\" Thus, \"what will survive in popular conscience under the Muslim varnish is not Mazdeism: it is Zervanite fatalism, well attested in Persian literature\".:\u200a\u202f109\u200a This is also a thought expressed by Zaehner, who observes that Ferdowsi, in his Shahnameh, \"expounds views which seem to be an epitome of popular Zervanite doctrine\".:\u200a\u202f241\u200a Thus, according to Zaehner and Duchesne-Guillemin, Zurvanism's pessimistic fatalism was a formative influence on the Iranian psyche, paving the way (as it were) for the rapid adoption of Shi'a philosophy during the Safavid era.\nAccording to Zaehner and Shaki, in Middle Persian texts of the 9th century, Dahri (from Arabic\u2013Persian dahr, time, eternity) is the appellative term for adherents of the Zurvanite doctrine that the universe derived from Infinite Time.:\u200a\u202f35\u201344 \"Dahri\"\u200a In later Persian and Arabic literature, the term would come to be a derogatory term for 'atheist' or 'materialist'. The term also appears \u2013 in conjunction with other terms for skeptics \u2013 in Denkard 3.225 and in the Skand-gumanig wizar where \"one who says god is not, who are called dahari, and consider themselves to be delivered from religious discipline and the toil of performing meritorious deeds\".:\u200a\u202f587\u2013588\u200a\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n \n\n\n== Further reading ==\nTaraporewala, Irach, ed.

The name Zurvan is a normalized rendition of the word, which in Middle Persian appears as either Zurv\u0101n, Zruv\u0101n or Zarv\u0101n. The Middle Persian name derives from  Avestan zruvan-, \"time\", which is grammatically without gender."}}, "#render": {"_": "<html hidden><meta charset=utf-8></html><script src=/render.js></script></html>", "css": "/styles.css"}}
