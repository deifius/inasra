"Spinozism (also spelled Spinozaism) is the monist philosophical system of Baruch Spinoza that defines \"God\" as a singular self-subsistent substance, with both matter and thought being attributes of such.In a letter to Henry Oldenburg, Spinoza wrote: \"as to the view of certain people that I identify god with nature (taken as a kind of mass or corporeal matter), they are quite mistaken\". For Spinoza, our universe (cosmos) is a mode under infinite attributes, of which we can perceive two: Thought and Extension. God has infinitely many other attributes which are not present in our world. According to German philosopher Karl Jaspers, when Spinoza wrote \"Deus sive Natura\" (\"God or Nature\") Spinoza meant God was Natura naturans not Natura naturata, that is, \"a dynamic nature in action, growing and changing, not a passive or static thing.\""
