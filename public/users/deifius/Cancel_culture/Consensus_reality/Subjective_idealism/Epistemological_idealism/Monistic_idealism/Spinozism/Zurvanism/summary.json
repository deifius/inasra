"Zurvanism is a hypothetical religious movement of Zoroastrianism in which the divinity Zurvan is a First Principle (primordial creator deity) who engendered equal-but-opposite twins, Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu. Zurvanism is also known as \"Zurvanite Zoroastrianism\", and may be contrasted with Mazdaism.\nIn Zurvanism, Zurvan was perceived as the god of infinite time and space and was aka (\"one\", \"alone\"). Zurvan was portrayed as a transcendental and neutral god, without passion, and one for whom there was no distinction between good or evil. The name Zurvan is a normalized rendition of the word, which in Middle Persian appears as either Zurv\u0101n, Zruv\u0101n or Zarv\u0101n. The Middle Persian name derives from  Avestan zruvan-, \"time\", which is grammatically without gender."
