"Objective idealism is an idealistic metaphysics that postulates that there is ultimately only one perceiver, and that this perceiver is also that which is perceived. In this school of thought, the many individual beings and their local perceptions are united through a collective unconscious. \nOne important advocate of such a metaphysics, Josiah Royce (the founder of American idealism), wrote that he was indifferent \"whether anybody calls all this Theism or Pantheism\". \nIt is distinct from the subjective idealism of George Berkeley, and it abandons the thing-in-itself of Kant's dualism."
