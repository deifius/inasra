Billed as \"Britain's Greatest Hero\", it is known for being in the style of an anthology title and for its multi-linear plotlines.\nHe first saw print in comics published by Paul Grist's Dancing Elephant Press, and is now published by Image Comics. Comics International began exclusive publication of a monthly four-page strip featuring the supporting character Ben Kulmer (the Claw); this started in #185 of the magazine and was set to run for twelve episodes.  These strips have since been reprinted by Image Comics in a special.\n\n\n== Publication history ==\nGrist created Jack Staff based on a story he had written to make use of Marvel's Union Jack character, only to be rejected.  He reworked the story to make it more of an original, self-contained comic which Grist then published through his own imprint, Dancing Elephant Press.  After twelve issues in black and white, Grist restarted the title with Image Comics, now with colour provided by Phil Elliott. This ran for 20 issues, then was ended.  It was restarted as the Weird World of Jack Staff that has had 6 issues.  Nothing new has been done since 2011.\nA crossover was planned between this title and Invincible, with Grist drawing and Robert Kirkman writing, but their schedules have not yet allowed it. Jack Staff himself has already appeared in a cameo in an earlier issue of the title, at the memorial service for the slain Guardians of the Globe, and later appeared helping to defend the Earth from an army of other-dimensional Invincible doubles during the globe-spanning Invincible #60. A crossover with Savage Dragon was also planned, in which Dragon would have visited Castletown as part of a storyline in which he searched the world for his missing wife.\n\n\n== Fictional character biography ==\nJack Staff, Britain's Greatest Hero, has been active since at least World War II.  While he has revealed he has been around since the Victorian Age and gained his powers there, it is unknown if he was active as a superhero or similar adventurer.  In his civilian identity, he works as a builder by the name of John Smith and has done since the 19th century.\nDuring World War II, he was active with the Freedom Fighters, a group of American and British superheroes: Sgt. States, Blazing Glory, and Tommy Twister.  During the war they defeated a vampire, Templar Richard, but not before Sgt. States also became a vampire (unknown to the rest of the team at the time). They also battled villains such as Kapitan Krieg and Brain Head.\nAfter the war, Jack continued as a superhero in the UK.  By the 1960s, he was helping a group called Unit D fight several menaces. After working to stop a British weapon of mass destruction, the Hurricane, in the early 1980s, Jack quit being a superhero. It has only been recently that Jack has come back as a superhero, fighting alongside Q, Commander Hawkes of the now defunct Unit D, Tom Tom the Robot Man, Becky Burdock: Vampire Reporter, and others.\nJack Staff was also an ally of the mysterious Mister Green, an entity working for/leading a cosmic force called \"the Green\", but severed his ties after the Hurricane incident. A slow-building subplot concerns an upcoming war, with \"the Green\" on one side and \"the Red\" on the other, and several of the comic's cast being recruited for it. Green has previously recruited Jack, and was recently revealed to have recruited Helen Morgan as well (and possibly more of Q through her) and taken Becky Burdock's old toy rabbit \u2014 or perhaps, in so doing, chosen Becky herself \u2014 to serve as a champion; a figure called the Man of Shadow is trying to recruit Becky. It's been hinted the Shadow and similar forces want to keep Becky & Jack apart. In The Weird World of Jack Staff #4, it was revealed Becky was indeed the prophesied champion who would save the world, and that Jack Staff's destined role was to keep her alive until then.\nIt has been noted by various characters (such as in Jack Staff Special #1) that Jack's record of success is a bit iffy; he often gets battered by supervillains and ends up in embarrassing or dangerous situations, such as being set up to be arrested by the Spider. In the future visions shown in Weird World, in the final battle he will be battered by the adversary; when the seers Professor Fate and Morlan the Mystic watch this battle, Morlan notes that Jack is incapable of defeating such a foe \"but he's going to try anyway\" (#3).\n\n\n== Powers and abilities ==\nAgile and acrobatic, the closest Jack Staff gets to a clearly defined power is his ability to move energy.  This has been shown by his moving energy into his staff to break through solid walls, or move the anger from Hurricane. This ability is never clearly defined with regard to where the energy is moved from, or what kind of energy is involved.\nJack appears to be either immortal or very long lived.  He reveals that he has been around since the at least the Victorian era.  He was active as Jack Staff during World War II up until the 1980s when he retired after the Hurricane incident.  He looks no different today then he did during World War II.  No further background on him has yet to be revealed, although in the twelfth issue of the second Image volume, there were hints of a connection with the \"Eternal Warrior\".\nHe has had dreams of some future threat, most recently in Jack Staff Special #1 \u2014 Becky Burdock is plagued by the same thing, though more frequently.\n\n\n== Collected editions ==\nThe comics have been collected into trade paperbacks:\n\nYesterday's Heroes (collects Jack Staff (vol. 1) #1-4, Dancing Elephant Press, April 2002, ISBN 0-9542264-0-2)Image Comics has also collected the comics:\n\nVolume 1: Everything Used to be Black and White (collects Jack Staff (vol. 1) #1-12, 352 pages, March 2004, ISBN 1-58240-335-X)\nVolume 2: Soldiers (collects Jack Staff (vol. 2) #1-5, 160 pages, November 2005, ISBN 1-58240-392-9)\nVolume 3: Echoes of Tomorrow (collects Jack Staff (vol. 2) #6-12, 200 pages, January 2007, ISBN 1-58240-719-3)\nVolume 4: Rocky Realities (collects Jack Staff (vol. 2) #13-20 and one-shot Special, March 2010, ISBN 1-60706-148-1)There is a one-shot collection of shorter stories:\n\n\"The Weird World of Jack Staff King Size Special\" (collects Jack Staff strips from Comics International #185-191, 193\u2013199, one-shot, Image Comics, July 2007)\n\n\n== Awards ==\n2001: Won \"Favourite British Small Press Title\" Eagle Award\n2002: Nominated for \"Best Self-Published/Independent\" National Comics Award\n2003:\nWon \"Best Self-Published/Independent\" National Comics Award\nNominated for \"Best New Comic\" National Comics Award\n2004: Nominated for \"Favourite British Small Press Title\" Eagle Award\n2007: Nominated for \"Favourite Colour Comicbook (American)\" Eagle Award\n\n\n== See also ==\nSupporting cast in Jack Staff\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJack Staff at Paul Grist Comics Index\nJack Staff discussion forum at Image comics\nFull issue: Jack Staff (vol. 1) #1, Image Comics\nFull issue: Jack Staff (vol. 2) #1, Image Comics", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9c/Jackstaffdep0.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg"], "summary": "Jack Staff is a British superhero created by comic book writer/artist Paul Grist.

It is a spin-off to The Walking Dead, which is based on the comic book series of the same name by Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard. The first three seasons serve as a prequel, focusing on a blended family who experience the start of the zombie apocalypse. Subsequent seasons run concurrently to the original show, with Morgan Jones (Lennie James) from The Walking Dead crossing over into the series.\n\nThe series premiered on August 23, 2015, and has completed its sixth season, which concluded on June 13, 2021. A seventh season has been announced, which is set to premiere on October 17, 2021.

In September 2014, AMC ordered a pilot, which was written by Kirkman and Dave Erickson, and directed by Adam Davidson, and is executive produced by Kirkman, Erickson, Gale Anne Hurd, and David Alpert, with Erickson serving as showrunner. The project was originally known as Cobalt; Kirkman confirmed, in March 2015, that the series would be titled Fear the Walking Dead. On March 9, 2015, AMC announced it had ordered Fear the Walking Dead to series, with a two-season commitment. The series premiered on August 23, 2015.\n\n\n=== Casting ===\n\nIn December 2014, the first four starring roles were cast: Kim Dickens as Madison Clark, the female lead; Cliff Curtis as Travis Manawa, the male lead; Frank Dillane as Nick; and Alycia Debnam-Carey as Alicia. In April and May 2015, Elizabeth Rodriguez and Mercedes Mason were announced as series regulars, both in unknown roles.In November 2017, it was confirmed that Lennie James who portrays Morgan Jones on The Walking Dead would crossover and join the main cast in the fourth season. The fourth season also sees the additions of several new series regulars, played by Garret Dillahunt, Jenna Elfman, and Maggie Grace.In December 2018, it was reported that Rub\u00e9n Blades, who last appeared in the series' third season, would return in the fifth season as Daniel Salazar.

Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter gave an average review, writing, \"The 90-minute first episode and the hour-long second episode are, while not actually boring, certainly less magnetic than the original.\"One of the harshest negative reviews came from HitFix, on Daniel Fienberg and Alan Sepinwall's podcast, where Fienberg called the premiere episode \"awful, just horrible ... as bad as The Walking Dead has ever gotten at its very worst. This is that bad. I've been kind of stunned to see people being generous to it. ... I thought this was almost unwatchably bad.\" Sepinwall called his B\u2212 review \"slightly generous\".\n\n\n==== Season 2 ====\nThe second season received mostly mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the season has a rating of 70%, based on 30 reviews, whose average rating is 6.60/10.

Reviewer Charlie Mason wrote, \"it's gone from being an adequate stopgap between seasons of The Walking Dead to a show that's as good or arguably even better than the one from which it was spun off.\" He also praised the addition of Jenna Elfman and Garret Dillahunt and that season 4 has had several genuine surprises in its storytelling.\n\n\n==== Season 5 ====\nThe fifth season received mostly mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the season has a rating of 55% based on 9 reviews, with an average rating of 5.10/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Despite delivering some memorable and splatter-filled zombie set-pieces that fans crave, Fear the Walking Dead feels stiff with early-onset rigor mortis in a fifth season that emphasizes altruism over coherent characterization.\"\n\n\n==== Season 6 ====\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the sixth season has an approval rating of 89% based on 9 reviews, with an average rating of 7.30/10.\n\n\n=== Ratings ===\nThe U.S. series premiere attracted 10.1 million total viewers, with 6.3 million in the advertiser-coveted 18-to-49-year-old demographic, both cable television records for a series premiere.

The fourth season, featuring four audio commentaries, was released on Blu-ray and DVD on March 5, 2019.\n\n\n== Lawsuit ==\nIn July 2018, Mel Smith, the creator of the comic book series Dead Ahead, filed a lawsuit against AMC Studios charging that the second season of Fear the Walking Dead stole thematic elements from Dead Ahead, specifically a group of survivors attempting to flee a zombie apocalypse by a boat. The lawsuit also includes David Alpert, who was Smith's agent and who remains a business partner with Robert Kirkman, and who is one of Fear's executive producers; Smith's lawsuit asserts that Alpert violated his fiduciary duty to protect Smith's interests when he began working on Fear. AMC attempted to have the lawsuit dismissed, stating that once one stripped out generic elements of the zombie genre, there were no further similarities between the works. In February 2019, judge Lucy Koh rejected this, believing that it would be necessary to have a discovery phase and expert testimony to evaluate AMC's stance.In March 2019, AMC settled the lawsuit, details remained confidential.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nFear the Walking Dead at IMDb", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Blank_television_set.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Vampire_Smiley.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fd/Fear_The_Walking_Dead_title_card.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/41/Fear_the_Walking_Dead_Season_1_Cast.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg"], "summary": "Fear the Walking Dead is an American post-apocalyptic horror drama television series created by Robert Kirkman and Dave Erickson for AMC.

It was released in October 1988 as their debut single and as the opening track of their album Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1. The song was the first recording made by the group, although it was originally intended as a bonus track on a European single by George Harrison. When he and Jeff Lynne presented the song to Harrison's record company, the executives insisted it was too good for that purpose, a decision that resulted in the formation of the Wilburys. The song was written primarily by Harrison, although, as with all the tracks on Vol. 1, the writing credit lists all five members of the band: Harrison, Lynne, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison and Tom Petty.\n\"Handle with Care\" was the Wilburys' most successful single. It peaked at number 45 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, number 2 on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart and number 21 on the UK Singles Chart, and was a top-five hit in Australia and New Zealand. Directed by David Leland, the video for the song was an MTV favourite in the late 1980s.\nPetty and his band the Heartbreakers often performed \"Handle with Care\" in concert. Lynne sang it with them at the Concert for George, a year after Harrison's death in November 2001. Harrison's son Dhani Harrison sung lead on the song with Jeff Lynne's ELO during their 2019 US tour.\n\n\n== Background ==\n\n\"Handle with Care\" came about through Warner Bros. Records, which distributed George Harrison's Dark Horse record label, pressing Harrison for an extra track for the European release of his \"This Is Love\" single. Having arrived in Los Angeles in April 1988, Harrison discussed the request over dinner with Jeff Lynne, his co-producer on the Cloud Nine album, and Roy Orbison, whose album Mystery Girl Lynne was producing at the time. Lynne agreed to help him record the track the following day, and Harrison invited Orbison to attend the session, after Orbison had said he \"would like to come along and watch\". With no professional studios available at such short notice, Harrison phoned Bob Dylan, who agreed to let them use his garage studio in Malibu. Tom Petty, who had also been working with Lynne in Los Angeles, was invited the following day, when Harrison went to retrieve his guitar from Petty's house.In a 1990 interview for the Dutch television show Countdown, Harrison said that he started writing \"Handle with Care\" \u2013 with a section in mind for Orbison to sing \u2013 on the morning of the session. Lynne helped Harrison complete the music for the song when they arrived at Dylan's house; according to Petty, Harrison had the chord sequence \"pretty much\" completed beforehand. In another contemporary interview, Harrison recalled that he had the opening line, \"Been beat-up and battered around\", but otherwise, the lyrics were the result of a group effort. Harrison asked Dylan, who had been tending a barbecue for the musicians, to \"Give us some lyrics, you famous lyricist.\" When Dylan asked for a title for the song, Harrison looked around the garage and said, \"Handle with Care\", after a label on a box.All five musicians assisted in writing the song's lyrics, and sang and played acoustic guitars on the basic track. Harrison said that, having already planned Orbison's segment, he decided to include portions sung by Dylan, Lynne and Petty.\n\n\n== Composition ==\n\"Handle with Care\" was written in the key of G major. The main riff and verses feature a four-bar chord sequence with a descending bass line. The first bridge includes a G augmented chord. The time signature throughout is 4/4, played to a moderate rock beat. In music journalist Matthew Greenwald's description, the composition is \"built around a descending, folk-rock chord pattern and some ... major-key chorus movements\". He identifies the song's message as being \"about getting out from under the shell of the '60s fallout, along with a strong theme of survival\".The song's structure comprises rounds containing three distinct sections: Harrison's verses, the Orbison-sung \"I'm so tired of being lonely\" bridge, and a second bridge led by Dylan. Author Ian Inglis writes that Harrison's verses reflect his having overcome hardships and challenges throughout his musical career, with the line \"Oh, the sweet smell of success!\" conveying a mix of optimism, resignation and cynicism regarding the concept of stardom. Inglis says that while the song bears \"Harrison's distinctive musical and vocal signature\", the Orbison-sung segments evoke the \"lonely\" theme that was a defining element of Orbison's work from the late 1950s onwards, just as Dylan's bridges, containing the line \"Put your body next to mine, and dream on\", capture the \"straightforward sexuality\" evident in songs from that artist's late 1960s country period.\n\n\n== Recording and Wilburys' formation ==\nThe ensemble taped the basic track of acoustic guitars, accompanied by a drum machine, on Dylan's Ampex recorder. According to Lynne, the instruments used were a mix of six- and twelve-string guitars. Having been invited by Harrison to assist with the recording, engineer Bill Bottrell recalled that the garage studio had yet to be set up and the equipment was a mix of seemingly unused items.The released recording includes Harrison's electric guitar riff, played on a Rickenbacker 12-string, and slide guitar solos, and Dylan on harmonica. The electric and bass guitars were added to the basic track on the day after the session at Dylan's house, and drummer Ian Wallace overdubbed tom-toms. According to Petty and Bottrell, Lynne played drums on the track and added a cowbell. The overdubbing session took place at Westlake Audio on Santa Monica Boulevard. Lynne said that they had invited Jim Keltner to play drums but he was unavailable. Wallace recalled that Lynne asked him to add some fills to the existing drum part, which Wallace said was a drum machine part, and that the venue was Quincy Jones' studio in Los Angeles, with all the Wilburys present except for Dylan.When Harrison presented a mix of \"Handle with Care\" to Warner Bros., the company's executives insisted that the track was too good to be used as \"filler\" on a European single. He recalled that they thought the song would be wasted since it would not benefit Cloud Nine's sales. In Petty's recollection, Harrison and Lynne then decided to realise their idea of forming the Traveling Wilburys, a band they had imagined during the sessions for Cloud Nine. On Harrison's next visit to Los Angeles, from 8 May onwards, he, Lynne, Dylan, Orbison and Petty began recording the album Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1. The recordings were completed by Harrison and Lynne, the Wilburys' producers, over the summer, at Harrison's Friar Park studio in  England.\n\n\n== Video ==\n\nThe Wilburys filmed a music video for \"Handle with Care\" in early October 1988, at an abandoned brewery near Union Station in Los Angeles. It was directed by David Leland, who had recently directed Harrison's HandMade Films production Checking Out. The video features the group members performing the song around an old-fashioned omnidirectional microphone. The band were dressed and styled by Roger Burton, whose stylist credits included the films Quadrophenia and Chariots of Fire, and music videos for David Bowie, Eurythmics and UB40.The video was the last to feature Orbison, who died of a heart attack on 6 December. Lynne recalls that, as they all travelled together to the film shoot, Orbison kept the band entertained by reciting entire Monty Python comedy sketches by himself. Lynne continues: \"And he's got this enormous and most infectious giggle you've ever heard, and we'd all be giggling like schoolgirls after a minute or two and all fall about!\" At the time, Lynne described the video as a \"nice film, where we're just playing, with nice shots of guitars and heads and feet\", and free of \"gimmicks and fireworks\". Orbison was dressed in a long black coat, black trousers and red shoes, and wore his usual diamond-encrusted Maltese cross broach.\n\n\n== Release ==\nBacked by \"Margarita\", \"Handle with Care\" was issued as the Wilburys' debut single on 17 October 1988, and as the opening track of Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 the following day. Although the group were viewed as being mainly Harrison's project, all the participants were keen to maintain a collaborative identity. Rather than use his Dark Horse label, they released the single and the album on a new Warner's imprint, Wilbury Records. The bandmates similarly shared the songwriting credits, although the allocation of each song's publishing rights reflected its main composer. In the case of \"Handle with Care\", the song was allocated to Harrison and his Ganga publishing company, which was later subsumed into his company Umlaut Corporation.Aside from the standard 7-inch record and 3-inch CD releases, the single was available in the 10- and 12-inch vinyl formats, both of which used an extended version of the A-side. In the US, the CD single included both the standard-length and extended versions of \"Handle with Care\". The single's cover art was designed by Wherefore Art? and included a group photograph taken by Neal Preston.According to authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, the song received widespread airplay on US radio and the video was given \"saturation play\" on MTV and VH-1. Although the album was a major commercial success there, the popularity of the single failed to translate into sales. On the US charts compiled by Billboard magazine, \"Handle with Care\" peaked at number 45 on the Hot 100, yet number 2 on the radioplay-based Album Rock Tracks chart. Elsewhere, it reached number 21 on the UK Singles Chart, number 3 in Australia, where Vol. 1 was the best-selling album of 1989, and number 4 in New Zealand. It was the highest charting of all the Wilburys' singles in the UK and the US.\n\n\n== Critical reception and legacy ==\nAs with Vol. 1, \"Handle with Care\" received highly favourable reviews from music critics, even though the Wilburys' sound was at odds with contemporary musical trends. In a review of their second album, which Harrison chose to title Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3, Elizabeth Wurtzel of New York magazine highlighted \"Handle with Care\" among the Wilburys' \"upbeat, irresistible songs ... that unified the rock audience\" in 1988, by presenting the middle-aged stars as a \"new act\" to young listeners while also finding favour with the babyboomer market.In his song review for AllMusic, Matthew Greenwald writes of \"Handle with Care\":\n\nThe opening track to the star-studded Traveling Wilburys album puts the group and their attitude in one compact package ... George Harrison handles the verses, and there are also two excellent bridges featuring Roy Orbison and Bob Dylan. Orbison's section capitalizes on his awesome, operatic vocal pipes, and the effect is wonderful ... In the end, the joy of camaraderie is what hits the listener the hardest and makes this one of the most memorable records of the 1980s.\nAuthor Howard Sounes says that, for Dylan, his friendship with Harrison enabled a collaboration that saved Dylan's career at a time when it was \"reaching its nadir\". He adds that the song had \"a clever lyric about middle age and a strong melody\" and featured an Orbison vocal performance that \"soared\". Matt Melis of Consequence of Sound lists \"Handle with Care\" tenth in his \"Top Ten Songs by Ex-Beatles\", saying that the Wilburys showed Harrison \"at his absolute best since his solo work in the early Seventies\" and, following this first spontaneous collaboration, \"The rest is super group history.\"Ian Inglis describes \"Handle with Care\" as a \"glorious example of the way in which a synthesis of contrasting talents can produce music that is effortless and natural\". With reference to the musical eras represented by Orbison, Harrison and Dylan, respectively, he concludes: \"its real significance rests ... on its symbolic fusion of three revolutionary moments in the history of rock 'n' roll that had their beginnings in Sam Phillips' Sun Studio in Memphis, in the clubs and bars of Liverpool and Hamburg, and in the folk venues of New York's Greenwich Village.\" Author Simon Leng views the song as a \"worthy hit\" that displays the three lead singers' styles to equally good effect and, in the closing solos by Harrison and Dylan, features \"two of the most famous instrumental signatures in popular music [playing] in tandem\". Jeff Burger, writing for The Morton Report in 2016, highlighted \"Handle with Care\" and \"Not Alone Any More\" as Vol. 1's fun-filled \"ear candy\" that \"profit from Orbison's inimitable soaring vocals, Harrison's trademark guitar, and Lynne's production\".In an article covering the launch of the expanded edition of Harrison's autobiography, I, Me, Mine, in 2017, Billboard's Andy Gensler commented that \"Handle with Care\" remained a fixture on FM radio.\nIn May 2018, the track was used to close the \"All the Wilburys\" episode of the US television show Billions. The Wilburys' group dynamic is referred to in the episode, when the character Ari Spyros, a socially awkward compliance officer, shouts \"Handle me with care!\" in an effort to persuade his colleagues that he is worthy of Wilbury status.\n\n\n== Live performances and cover versions ==\n\nTom Petty and the Heartbreakers and Lynne performed \"Handle with Care\" at the Concert for George tribute in November 2002, a year after Harrison's death, and at Harrison's induction as a solo artist into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004. Petty and the Heartbreakers introduced the song into the set list for their own shows in 2003. A live recording appears on the band's 2005 DVD Live in Concert: Soundstage, recorded in Chicago for the Soundstage television series. In the Concert for George documentary film, which was again directed by David Leland, Petty and Lynne's performance is interspersed with interview footage in which Petty discusses the writing of the song.On 14 September 2014, during the BBC Radio 2 Festival in a Day event in London's Hyde Park, Lynne performed \"Handle with Care\" as a tribute to Harrison and Orbison. The performance was accompanied by images of the two late Wilburys projected onto the backdrop of the stage.In 2006, Jenny Lewis covered \"Handle with Care\" on her debut solo album, Rabbit Fur Coat, recorded with the Watson Twins, Ben Gibbard, Conor Oberst and M. Ward. While Andy Gill of The Independent said that the confident performance by Lewis and her collaborators \"ensures that even a cover as unhip as The Traveling Wilburys' 'Handle With Care' sounds engaging\", Will Levith of Ultimate Classic Rock dismissed it as a \"terrible\" version that resembled a \"boozy, late-night karaoke\" rendition next to the superlative performances of Harrison and Orbison on the Wilburys' \"classic\". Writing in March 2007, after the announcement that the long-unavailable Wilburys' catalogue was about to be reissued, in the box set The Traveling Wilburys Collection, Whitney Pastorek of Entertainment Weekly said: \"while Petty's been doing the tune in concert for years, Jenny Lewis' decision to cover that song on last year's Rabbit Fur Coat seemed to get plenty of hipsters asking, Dude, how come I can't buy the original? And, as we all know, what the hipsters want, the hipsters get. Huzzah!\"Damien Leith included \"Handle with Care\" on his 2011 Orbison tribute album Roy: A Tribute to Roy Orbison. At the 2014 George Fest tribute in Los Angeles, organised by Harrison's son Dhani, the song was performed as the penultimate number by an ensemble including Brandon Flowers, Dhani Harrison, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, Britt Daniel and Wayne Coyne. Reviewing the 2016 album and DVD release from the concert, for PopMatters, Megan Volpert wrote: \"The gentlemen collaborate with Dhani on the Wilburys' 'Handle with Care', audibly evoking not just the noises of George, but also the ghost of Roy Orbison and almost hilariously good impersonations of Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne ... Dhani could've gotten Petty and Lynne, no doubt \u2013 but he is working on something arguably more important here than what Concert for George hoped to accomplish.\" In 2017, Stephen Stills and Judy Collins released a version of the song as the opening track of their album Everybody Knows.Dhani Harrison sang \"Handle with Care\" as a featured guest during Jeff Lynne and ELO's tour of the US in the summer of 2019.\n\n\n== Track listing ==\nDetails per Madinger and Easter:\n7\" and non-US CD single\nA\t \t\"Handle with Care\" (LP Version) \u2013 3:20\nB\t \t\"Margarita\" (LP Version) \u2013 3:1612\" single (also 10\" size)\nA\t \t\"Handle with Care\" (Extended Version) \u2013 5:14\nB\t \t\"Margarita\" \u2013 3:16US CD single\"Handle with Care\" (LP Version) \u2013 3:20\n\"Margarita\" (LP Version) \u2013 3:16\n\"Handle with Care\" (Extended Version) \u2013 5:14\n\n\n== Personnel ==\nTraveling Wilburys\n\nGeorge Harrison \u2013 lead and harmony vocals, acoustic and electric guitars, slide guitar\nRoy Orbison \u2013 lead and harmony vocals, acoustic guitar\nBob Dylan \u2013 harmony vocals, acoustic guitar, harmonica\nJeff Lynne \u2013 harmony vocals, acoustic and electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, cowbell\nTom Petty \u2013 harmony vocals, acoustic guitarAdditional musician\n\nIan Wallace \u2013 tom-toms\n\n\n== Charts ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Handle with Care\" at Discogs", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Jefflynne_hydepark.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Point_Dume_from_Zuma_Beach.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1a/Union_Station_profile%2C_LA%2C_CA%2C_jjron_22.03.2012.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/39/Handle_with_Care_Single.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg"], "summary": "\"Handle with Care\" is a song by the British-American supergroup the Traveling Wilburys. It was released in October 1988 as their debut single and as the opening track of their album Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1. The song was the first recording made by the group, although it was originally intended as a bonus track on a European single by George Harrison. When he and Jeff Lynne presented the song to Harrison's record company, the executives insisted it was too good for that purpose, a decision that resulted in the formation of the Wilburys. The song was written primarily by Harrison, although, as with all the tracks on Vol. 1, the writing credit lists all five members of the band: Harrison, Lynne, Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison and Tom Petty.\n\"Handle with Care\" was the Wilburys' most successful single. It peaked at number 45 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, number 2 on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart and number 21 on the UK Singles Chart, and was a top-five hit in Australia and New Zealand. Directed by David Leland, the video for the song was an MTV favourite in the late 1980s.\nPetty and his band the Heartbreakers often performed \"Handle with Care\" in concert. Lynne sang it with them at the Concert for George, a year after Harrison's death in November 2001. Harrison's son Dhani Harrison sung lead on the song with Jeff Lynne's ELO during their 2019 US tour.\n\n"}, "Wilbury_Twist": {"links": ["Handle with Care ", "Inside Out ", "MetroLyrics", "Roy Orbison", "She's My Baby ", "Milli Vanilli", "Jeff Lynne", "Traveling Wilburys", "Whoopi Goldberg", "Traveling Wilburys Vol. three", "Kala Savage", "Woody Harrelson", "MBRG ", "Tweeter and the Monkey Man", "The Traveling Wilburys Collection", "Fred Savage", "Record producer", "Traveling Wilburys Vol. one", "Eric Idle", "Wilbury Records", "ASCAP", "Ben Savage", "YouTube", "Supergroup ", "Warner Bros.

It originated from black American music such as gospel, jump blues, jazz, boogie woogie, rhythm and blues, as well as country music. While rock and roll's formative elements can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until 1954.According to journalist Greg Kot, \"rock and roll\" refers to a style of popular music originating in the United States in the 1950s. By the mid-1960s, rock and roll had developed into \"the more encompassing international style known as rock music, though the latter also continued to be known in many circles as rock and roll.\" For the purpose of differentiation, this article deals with the first definition.\nIn the earliest rock and roll styles, either the piano or saxophone was typically the lead instrument. These instruments were generally replaced or supplemented by guitar in the middle to late 1950s. The beat is essentially a dance rhythm with an accentuated backbeat, almost always provided by a snare drum. Classic rock and roll is usually played with one or two electric guitars (one lead, one rhythm) and a double bass (string bass). After the mid-1950s, electric bass guitars and drum kits became popular in classic rock.Rock and roll had a polarizing influence on lifestyles, fashion, attitudes, and language. It is often depicted in movies, fan magazines, and on television. Rock and roll may have contributed to the civil rights movement because both Black American and White American teenagers enjoyed the music.\n\n\n== Terminology ==\n\nThe term \"rock and roll\" is defined by Greg Kot in Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica as the music that originated in the mid-1950s and later developed \"into the more encompassing international style known as rock music\". The term is sometimes also used as synonymous with \"rock music\" and is defined as such in some dictionaries.The phrase \"rocking and rolling\" originally described the movement of a ship on the ocean, but by the early 20th century was used both to describe the spiritual fervor of black church rituals and as a sexual analogy. A retired Welsh seaman named William Fender can be heard singing the phrase \"rock and roll\" when describing a sexual encounter in his performance of the traditional song \"The Baffled Knight\" to the folklorist James Madison Carpenter in the early 1930s, which he would have learned at sea in the 1800s; the recording can be heard on the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library website.Various gospel, blues and swing recordings used the phrase before it became widely popular; it was used in 1940s recordings and reviews of what became known as \"rhythm and blues\" music aimed at a black audience.In 1934, the song \"Rock and Roll\" by the Boswell Sisters appeared in the film Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round. In 1942, before the concept of rock and roll had been defined, Billboard magazine columnist Maurie Orodenker started to use the term to describe upbeat recordings such as \"Rock Me\" by Sister Rosetta Tharpe; her style on that recording was described as \"rock-and-roll spiritual singing\". By 1943, the \"Rock and Roll Inn\" in South Merchantville, New Jersey, was established as a music venue. In 1951, Cleveland, Ohio, disc jockey Alan Freed began playing this music style, and referring to it as \"rock and roll\" on his mainstream radio program, which popularized the phrase.Several sources suggest that Freed found the term, used as a synonym for sexual intercourse, on the record \"Sixty Minute Man\" by Billy Ward and his Dominoes. The lyrics include the line, \"I rock 'em, roll 'em all night long\". Freed did not acknowledge the suggestion about that source in interviews, and explained the term as follows: \"Rock \u2019n roll is really swing with a modern name. It began on the levees and plantations, took in folk songs, and features blues and rhythm\".In discussing Alan Freed's contribution to the genre, two significant sources emphasized the importance of African-American rhythm and blues. Greg Harris, then the Executive Director of the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame, offered this comment to CNN: \"Freed\u2019s role in breaking down racial barriers in U.S. pop culture in the 1950s, by leading white and black kids to listen to the same music, put the radio personality 'at the vanguard' and made him 'a really important figure'\". After Freed was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the organization's Web site offered this comment: \"He became internationally known for promoting African-American rhythm and blues music on the radio in the United States and Europe under the name of rock and roll\".Not often acknowledged in the history of rock and roll, Todd Storz, the owner of radio station KOWH in Omaha, Nebraska, was the first to adopt the Top 40 format (in 1953), playing only the most popular records in rotation. His station, and the numerous others which adopted the concept, helped to promote the genre: by the mid 50s, the playlist included artists such as \"Presley, Lewis, Haley, Berry and Domino\".\n\n\n== Early rock and roll ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\n\nThe origins of rock and roll have been fiercely debated by commentators and historians of music. There is general agreement that it arose in the Southern United States \u2013 a region that would produce most of the major early rock and roll acts \u2013 through the meeting of various influences that embodied a merging of the African musical tradition with European instrumentation. The migration of many former slaves and their descendants to major urban centers such as St. Louis, Memphis, New York City, Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland, and Buffalo meant that black and white residents were living in close proximity in larger numbers than ever before, and as a result heard each other's music and even began to emulate each other's fashions. Radio stations that made white and black forms of music available to both groups, the development and spread of the gramophone record, and African-American musical styles such as jazz and swing which were taken up by white musicians, aided this process of \"cultural collision\".\n\nThe immediate roots of rock and roll lay in the rhythm and blues, then called \"race music\", in combination with either Boogie-woogie and shouting gospel or with country music of the 1940s and 1950s. Particularly significant influences were jazz, blues, gospel, country, and folk. Commentators differ in their views of which of these forms were most important and the degree to which the new music was a re-branding of African-American rhythm and blues for a white market, or a new hybrid of black and white forms.In the 1930s, jazz, and particularly swing, both in urban-based dance bands and blues-influenced country swing (Jimmie Rodgers, Moon Mullican and other similar singers), were among the first music to present African-American sounds for a predominantly white audience. One particularly noteworthy example of a jazz song with recognizably rock and roll elements is Big Joe Turner with pianist Pete Johnson's 1939 single Roll 'Em Pete, which is regarded as an important precursor of rock and roll. The 1940s saw the increased use of blaring horns (including saxophones), shouted lyrics and boogie woogie beats in jazz-based music. During and immediately after World War II, with shortages of fuel and limitations on audiences and available personnel, large jazz bands were less economical and tended to be replaced by smaller combos, using guitars, bass and drums. In the same period, particularly on the West Coast and in the Midwest, the development of jump blues, with its guitar riffs, prominent beats and shouted lyrics, prefigured many later developments. In the documentary film Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll, Keith Richards proposes that Chuck Berry developed his brand of rock and roll by transposing the familiar two-note lead line of jump blues piano directly to the electric guitar, creating what is instantly recognizable as rock guitar. Similarly, country boogie and Chicago electric blues supplied many of the elements that would be seen as characteristic of rock and roll. Inspired by electric blues, Chuck Berry introduced an aggressive guitar sound to rock and roll, and established the electric guitar as its centerpiece, adapting his rock band instrumentation from the basic blues band instrumentation of a lead guitar, second chord instrument, bass and drums. In 2017, Robert Christgau declared that \"Chuck Berry did in fact invent rock 'n' roll\", explaining that this artist \"came the closest of any single figure to being the one who put all the essential pieces together\".\n\nRock and roll arrived at a time of considerable technological change, soon after the development of the electric guitar, amplifier and microphone, and the 45 rpm record. There were also changes in the record industry, with the rise of independent labels like Atlantic, Sun and Chess servicing niche audiences and a similar rise of radio stations that played their music. It was the realization that relatively affluent white teenagers were listening to this music that led to the development of what was to be defined as rock and roll as a distinct genre. Because the development of rock and roll was an evolutionary process, no single record can be identified as unambiguously \"the first\" rock and roll record. Contenders for the title of \"first rock and roll record\" include Sister Rosetta Tharpe's \"Strange Things Happening Every Day\" (1944), \"That's All Right\" by Arthur Crudup (1946),  \"Move It On Over\" by Hank Williams (1947), \"The Fat Man\" by Fats Domino (1949), Goree Carter's \"Rock Awhile\" (1949), Jimmy Preston's \"Rock the Joint\" (1949), which was later covered by Bill Haley & His Comets in 1952, \"Rocket 88\" by Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats (Ike Turner and his band The Kings of Rhythm), recorded by Sam Phillips for Sun Records in March 1951. In terms of its wide cultural impact across society in the US and elsewhere, Bill Haley's \"Rock Around the Clock\", recorded in April 1954 but not a commercial success until the following year, is generally recognized as an important milestone, but it was preceded by many recordings from earlier decades in which elements of rock and roll can be clearly discerned.Other artists with early rock and roll hits included Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Gene Vincent. Chuck Berry's 1955 classic \"Maybellene\" in particular features a distorted electric guitar solo with warm overtones created by his small valve amplifier. However, the use of distortion was predated by electric blues guitarists such as Joe Hill Louis, Guitar Slim, Willie Johnson of Howlin' Wolf's band, and Pat Hare; the latter two also made use of distorted power chords in the early 1950s. Also in 1955, Bo Diddley introduced the \"Bo Diddley beat\" and a unique electric guitar style, influenced by African and Afro-Cuban music and in turn influencing many later artists.\n\n\n=== Rhythm and blues ===\nRock and roll was strongly influenced by R&B, according to many sources, including an article in the Wall Street Journal in 1985 titled, \"Rock! It's Still Rhythm and Blues\". In fact, the author stated that the \"two terms were used interchangeably\", until about 1957. The other sources quoted in the article said that rock and roll combined R&B with pop and country music.Fats Domino was one of the biggest stars of rock and roll in the early 1950s and he was not convinced that this was a new genre. In 1957, he said: \"What they call rock 'n' roll now is rhythm and blues. I\u2019ve been playing it for 15 years in New Orleans\". According to Rolling Stone, \"this is a valid statement ... all Fifties rockers, black and white, country born and city-bred, were fundamentally influenced by R&B, the black popular music of the late Forties and early Fifties\".  Further, Little Richard built his ground-breaking sound of the same era with an uptempo blend of boogie-woogie, New Orleans rhythm and blues, and the soul and fervor of gospel music vocalization. \n\n\n=== Rockabilly ===\n\n\"Rockabilly\" usually (but not exclusively) refers to the type of rock and roll music which was played and recorded in the mid-1950s primarily by white singers such as Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis, who drew mainly on the country roots of the music. Presley was greatly influenced and incorporated his style of music with some of the greatest African American musicians like BB King, Arthur Crudup and Fats Domino.  His style of music combined with black influences created controversy during a turbulent time in history. Many other popular rock and roll singers of the time, such as Fats Domino and Little Richard, came out of the black rhythm and blues tradition, making the music attractive to white audiences, and are not usually classed as \"rockabilly\".\nPresley popularized rock and roll on a wider scale than any other single performer and by 1956, he had emerged as the singing sensation of the nation.Bill Flagg who is a Connecticut resident, began referring to his mix of hillbilly and rock 'n' roll music as rockabilly around 1953. His song \"Guitar Rock\" is considered as classic rockabilly.In July 1954, Presley recorded the regional hit \"That's All Right\" at Sam Phillips' Sun Studio in Memphis. Three months earlier, on April 12, 1954, Bill Haley & His Comets recorded \"Rock Around the Clock\". Although only a minor hit when first released, when used in the opening sequence of the movie Blackboard Jungle a year later, it set the rock and roll boom in motion. The song became one of the biggest hits in history, and frenzied teens flocked to see Haley and the Comets perform it, causing riots in some cities. \"Rock Around the Clock\" was a breakthrough for both the group and for all of rock and roll music. If everything that came before laid the groundwork, \"Rock Around the Clock\" introduced the music to a global audience.In 1956, the arrival of rockabilly was underlined by the success of songs like \"Folsom Prison Blues\" by Johnny Cash, \"Blue Suede Shoes\" by Perkins and the No. 1 hit \"Heartbreak Hotel\" by Presley. For a few years it became the most commercially successful form of rock and roll. Later rockabilly acts, particularly performing songwriters like Buddy Holly, would be a major influence on British Invasion acts and particularly on the song writing of the Beatles and through them on the nature of later rock music.\n\n\n=== Doo wop ===\n\nDoo-wop was one of the most popular forms of 1950s rhythm and blues, often compared with rock and roll, with an emphasis on multi-part vocal harmonies and meaningless backing lyrics (from which the genre later gained its name), which were usually supported with light instrumentation. Its origins were in African-American vocal groups of the 1930s and 40s, such as the Ink Spots and the Mills Brothers, who had enjoyed considerable commercial success with arrangements based on close harmonies. They were followed by 1940s R&B vocal acts such as the Orioles, the Ravens and the Clovers, who injected a strong element of traditional gospel and, increasingly, the energy of jump blues. By 1954, as rock and roll was beginning to emerge, a number of similar acts began to cross over from the R&B charts to mainstream success, often with added honking brass and saxophone, with the Crows, the Penguins, the El Dorados and the Turbans all scoring major hits. Despite the subsequent explosion in records from doo wop acts in the later '50s, many failed to chart or were one-hit wonders. Exceptions included the Platters, with songs including \"The Great Pretender\" (1955) and the Coasters with humorous songs like \"Yakety Yak\" (1958), both of which ranked among the most successful rock and roll acts of the era. Towards the end of the decade there were increasing numbers of white, particularly Italian-American, singers taking up Doo Wop, creating all-white groups like the Mystics and Dion and the Belmonts and racially integrated groups like the Del-Vikings and the Impalas. Doo-wop would be a major influence on vocal surf music, soul and early Merseybeat, including the Beatles.\n\n\n=== Cover versions ===\n\nMany of the earliest white rock and roll hits were covers or partial re-writes of earlier black rhythm and blues or blues songs. Through the late 1940s and early 1950s, R&B music had been gaining a stronger beat and a wilder style, with artists such as Fats Domino and Johnny Otis speeding up the tempos and increasing the backbeat to great popularity on the juke joint circuit. Before the efforts of Freed and others, black music was taboo on many white-owned radio outlets, but artists and producers quickly recognized the potential of rock and roll. Some of Presley's early recordings were covers of black rhythm and blues or blues songs, such as \"That's All Right\" (a countrified arrangement of a blues number), \"Baby Let's Play House\", \"Lawdy Miss Clawdy\" and \"Hound Dog\". The racial lines, however, are rather more clouded by the fact that some of these R&B songs originally recorded by black artists had been written by white songwriters, such as the team of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. Songwriting credits were often unreliable; many publishers, record executives, and even managers (both white and black) would insert their name as a composer in order to collect royalty checks.\nCovers were customary in the music industry at the time; it was made particularly easy by the compulsory license provision of United States copyright law (still in effect). One of the first relevant successful covers was Wynonie Harris's transformation of Roy Brown's 1947 original jump blues hit \"Good Rocking Tonight\" into a more showy rocker and the Louis Prima rocker \"Oh Babe\" in 1950, as well as Amos Milburn's cover of what may have been the first white rock and roll record, Hardrock Gunter's \"Birmingham Bounce\" in 1949. The most notable trend, however, was white pop covers of black R&B numbers. The more familiar sound of these covers may have been more palatable to white audiences, there may have been an element of prejudice, but labels aimed at the white market also had much better distribution networks and were generally much more profitable. Famously, Pat Boone recorded sanitized versions of songs recorded by the likes of Fats Domino, Little Richard, the Flamingos and Ivory Joe Hunter. Later, as those songs became popular, the original artists' recordings received radio play as well.The cover versions were not necessarily straightforward imitations. For example, Bill Haley's incompletely bowdlerized cover of \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\" transformed Big Joe Turner's humorous and racy tale of adult love into an energetic teen dance number, while Georgia Gibbs replaced Etta James's tough, sarcastic vocal in \"Roll With Me, Henry\" (covered as \"Dance With Me, Henry\") with a perkier vocal more appropriate for an audience unfamiliar with the song to which James's song was an answer, Hank Ballard's \"Work With Me, Annie\". Presley's rock and roll version of \"Hound Dog\", taken mainly from a version recorded by the pop band Freddie Bell and the Bellboys, was very different from the blues shouter that Big Mama Thornton had recorded four years earlier. Other white artists who recorded cover versions of rhythm & blues songs included Gale Storm [Smiley Lewis' \"I Hear You Knockin'\"], the Diamonds [The Gladiolas' \"Little Darlin'\" and Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers' \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love?\"], the Crew Cuts [the Chords' \"Sh-Boom\" and Nappy Brown's \"Don't Be Angry\"], the Fountain Sisters [The Jewels' \"Hearts of Stone\"] and the Maguire Sisters [The Moonglows' \"Sincerely\"].\n\n\n== Decline ==\n\nSome commentators have suggested a decline of rock and roll in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The retirement of Little Richard to become a preacher (October 1957), the departure of Presley for service in the United States Army (March 1958), the scandal surrounding Jerry Lee Lewis' marriage to his thirteen-year-old cousin (May 1958), the deaths of Buddy Holly, The Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens in a plane crash (February 1959), the breaking of the Payola scandal implicating major figures, including Alan Freed, in bribery and corruption in promoting individual acts or songs (November 1959), the arrest of Chuck Berry (December 1959), and the death of Eddie Cochran in a car crash (April 1960) gave a sense that the initial phase of rock and roll had come to an end.During the late 1950s and early 1960s, the rawer sounds of Presley, Gene Vincent, Jerry Lee Lewis and Buddy Holly were commercially superseded by a more polished, commercial style of rock and roll.  Marketing frequently emphasized the physical looks of the artist rather than the music, contributing to the successful careers of Ricky Nelson, Tommy Sands, Bobby Vee and the Philadelphia trio of Bobby Rydell, Frankie Avalon, Fabian,  and Del Shannon, who all became \"teen idols.\"Some music historians have also pointed to important and innovative developments that built on rock and roll in this period, including multitrack recording, developed by Les Paul, the electronic treatment of sound by such innovators as Joe Meek, and the \"Wall of Sound\" productions of Phil Spector, continued desegregation of the charts, the rise of surf music, garage rock and the Twist dance craze. Surf rock in particular, noted for the use of reverb-drenched guitars, became one of the most popular forms of American rock of the 1960s.\n\n\n== British rock and roll ==\n\nIn the 1950s, Britain was well placed to receive American rock and roll music and culture. It shared a common language, had been exposed to American culture through the stationing of troops in the country, and shared many social developments, including the emergence of distinct youth sub-cultures, which in Britain included the Teddy Boys and the rockers. Trad jazz became popular in the UK, and many of its musicians were influenced by related American styles, including boogie woogie and the blues. The skiffle craze, led by Lonnie Donegan, utilised amateurish versions of American folk songs and encouraged many of the subsequent generation of rock and roll, folk, R&B and beat musicians to start performing. At the same time British audiences were beginning to encounter American rock and roll, initially through films including Blackboard Jungle (1955) and Rock Around the Clock (1956). Both movies featured the Bill Haley & His Comets hit \"Rock Around the Clock\", which first entered the British charts in early 1955 \u2013 four months before it reached the US pop charts \u2013 topped the British charts later that year and again in 1956, and helped identify rock and roll with teenage delinquency.The initial response of the British music industry was to attempt to produce copies of American records, recorded with session musicians and often fronted by teen idols. More grassroots British rock and rollers soon began to appear, including Wee Willie Harris and Tommy Steele. During this period American Rock and Roll remained dominant; however, in 1958 Britain produced its first \"authentic\" rock and roll song and star, when Cliff Richard reached number 2 in the charts with \"Move It\". At the same time, TV shows such as Six-Five Special and Oh Boy! promoted the careers of British rock and rollers like Marty Wilde and Adam Faith. Cliff Richard and his backing band, the Shadows, were the most successful home grown rock and roll based acts of the era. Other leading acts included Billy Fury, Joe Brown, and Johnny Kidd & the Pirates, whose 1960 hit song \"Shakin' All Over\" became a rock and roll standard.As interest in rock and roll was beginning to subside in America in the late 1950s and early 1960s, it was taken up by groups in major British urban centers like Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, and London. About the same time, a British blues scene developed, initially led by purist blues followers such as Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies who were directly inspired by American musicians such as Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters and Howlin' Wolf. Many groups moved towards the beat music of rock and roll and rhythm and blues from skiffle, like the Quarrymen who became the Beatles, producing a form of rock and roll revivalism that carried them and many other groups to national success from about 1963 and to international success from 1964, known in America as the British Invasion. Groups that followed the Beatles included the beat-influenced Freddie and the Dreamers, Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders, Herman's Hermits and the Dave Clark Five. Early British rhythm and blues groups with more blues influences include the Animals, the Rolling Stones, and the Yardbirds.\n\n\n== Cultural impact ==\n\nRock and roll influenced lifestyles, fashion, attitudes, and language. In addition, rock and roll may have contributed to the civil rights movement because both African-American and white American teens enjoyed the music.Many early rock and roll songs dealt with issues of cars, school, dating, and clothing. The lyrics of rock and roll songs described events and conflicts that most listeners could relate to through personal experience. Topics such as sex that had generally been considered taboo began to appear in rock and roll lyrics. This new music tried to break boundaries and express emotions that people were actually feeling but had not talked about. An awakening began to take place in American youth culture.\n\n\n=== Race ===\nIn the crossover of African-American \"race music\" to a growing white youth audience, the popularization of rock and roll involved both black performers reaching a white audience and white musicians performing African-American music. Rock and roll appeared at a time when racial tensions in the United States were entering a new phase, with the beginnings of the civil rights movement for desegregation, leading to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that abolished the policy of \"separate but equal\" in 1954, but leaving a policy which would be extremely difficult to enforce in parts of the United States. The coming together of white youth audiences and black music in rock and roll inevitably provoked strong white racist reactions within the US, with many whites condemning its breaking down of barriers based on color. Many observers saw rock and roll as heralding the way for desegregation, in creating a new form of music that encouraged racial cooperation and shared experience. Many authors have argued that early rock and roll was instrumental in the way both white and black teenagers identified themselves.\n\n\n=== Teen culture ===\n\nSeveral rock historians have claimed that rock and roll was one of the first music genres to define an age group. It gave teenagers a sense of belonging, even when they were alone. Rock and roll is often identified with the emergence of teen culture among the first baby boomer generation, who had greater relative affluence and leisure time and adopted rock and roll as part of a distinct subculture. This involved not just music, absorbed via radio, record buying, jukeboxes and TV programs like American Bandstand, but also extended to film, clothes, hair, cars and motorbikes, and distinctive language. The youth culture exemplified by rock and roll was a recurring source of concern for older generations, who worried about juvenile delinquency and social rebellion, particularly because to a large extent rock and roll culture was shared by different racial and social groups.In America, that concern was conveyed even in youth cultural artifacts such as comic books. In \"There's No Romance in Rock and Roll\" from True Life Romance (1956), a defiant teen dates a rock and roll-loving boy but drops him for one who likes traditional adult music\u2014to her parents' relief. In Britain, where postwar prosperity was more limited, rock and roll culture became attached to the pre-existing Teddy Boy movement, largely working class in origin, and eventually to the rockers. Rock and roll has been seen as reorienting popular music toward a youth market, as in Dion and the Belmonts' \"A Teenager in Love\" (1960).\n\n\n=== Dance styles ===\nFrom its early 1950s beginnings through the early 1960s, rock and roll spawned new dance crazes including the twist. Teenagers found the syncopated backbeat rhythm especially suited to reviving Big Band-era jitterbug dancing. Sock hops, school and church gym dances, and home basement dance parties became the rage, and American teens watched Dick Clark's American Bandstand to keep up on the latest dance and fashion styles. From the mid-1960s on, as \"rock and roll\" was rebranded as  \"rock,\" later dance genres followed, leading to funk, disco, house, techno, and hip hop.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nRock music at Curlie\nThe Camp Meeting Jubilee 1910 recording\nThe Smithsonian's history of the electric guitar\nHistory of Rock\nYoungtown Rock and Roll Museum \u2013 Omemee, Ontario", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/BillHaley.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f0/Birthplace_of_Rock_%27N%27_Roll.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Buddy_Holly_%26_The_Crickets_publicity_portrait_-_cropped.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Chuck_Berry_1957.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Elvis_Presley_promoting_Jailhouse_Rock.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Little_Richard_1957_%28cropped%29.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/Musical_note_nicu_bucule_01.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Tommy_Steele_1957.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Tommy_Steele_1957.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/True_Life_Romance_3.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Wikidata-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e2/Symbol_portal_class.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/06/Wiktionary-logo-v2.svg"], "summary": "Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll, rock 'n' roll, or rock 'n roll) is a genre of popular music that evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s. It originated from black American music such as gospel, jump blues, jazz, boogie woogie, rhythm and blues, as well as country music. While rock and roll's formative elements can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until 1954.According to journalist Greg Kot, \"rock and roll\" refers to a style of popular music originating in the United States in the 1950s. By the mid-1960s, rock and roll had developed into \"the more encompassing international style known as rock music, though the latter also continued to be known in many circles as rock and roll.\" For the purpose of differentiation, this article deals with the first definition.\nIn the earliest rock and roll styles, either the piano or saxophone was typically the lead instrument. These instruments were generally replaced or supplemented by guitar in the middle to late 1950s. The beat is essentially a dance rhythm with an accentuated backbeat, almost always provided by a snare drum. Classic rock and roll is usually played with one or two electric guitars (one lead, one rhythm) and a double bass (string bass). After the mid-1950s, electric bass guitars and drum kits became popular in classic rock.Rock and roll had a polarizing influence on lifestyles, fashion, attitudes, and language. It is often depicted in movies, fan magazines, and on television. Rock and roll may have contributed to the civil rights movement because both Black American and White American teenagers enjoyed the music."}}, "#render": {"_": "<html hidden><meta charset=utf-8></html><script src=/render.js></script></html>", "css": "/styles.css"}}
