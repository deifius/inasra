This is that bad. I've been kind of stunned to see people being generous to it. ...

The lawsuit also includes David Alpert, who was Smith's agent and who remains a business partner with Robert Kirkman, and who is one of Fear's executive producers; Smith's lawsuit asserts that Alpert violated his fiduciary duty to protect Smith's interests when he began working on Fear. AMC attempted to have the lawsuit dismissed, stating that once one stripped out generic elements of the zombie genre, there were no further similarities between the works. In February 2019, judge Lucy Koh rejected this, believing that it would be necessary to have a discovery phase and expert testimony to evaluate AMC's stance.In March 2019, AMC settled the lawsuit, details remained confidential.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\nOfficial website\nFear the Walking Dead at IMDb"
