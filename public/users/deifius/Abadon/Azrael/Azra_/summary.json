"Azra was a Croatian and Yugoslav rock band that was one of the most popular acts of the Yugoslav new wave music of the 1980s. Azra was formed in 1977 by its frontman Branimir \"Johnny\" \u0160tuli\u0107. The other two members of the original line-up were Mi\u0161o Hrnjak (bass) and Boris Leiner (drums). The band is named after a verse  from \"Der Asra\" by Heinrich Heine. They are considered to be one of the most influential bands from the Yugoslav new wave rock era and the Yugoslav rock scene in general.\nThey released their first single in 1979 with songs \"Balkan\" and \"A \u0161ta da radim\". The first album named Azra was published in 1980 and achieved commercial success and popularized Azra in Yugoslavia. Their second album was released in 1981. Azra recorded its last studio album Izme\u0111u krajnosti (Between the Extremes) in 1987. In 1988 the band recorded 4LP live album under the name Zadovolj\u0161tina (Satisfaction), after which \u0160tuli\u0107 disbanded the band. \u0160tuli\u0107 recorded three more solo albums since moving to the Netherlands, where he lives in seclusion. A 2003 rock documentary, Sretno dijete depicts Azra as the focus of the rock scene in Yugoslavia during the 1980s, along with Bijelo dugme. Even today, Azra remains very popular among youth in the countries of the former Yugoslavia.\nIn 1998, the music critics compiled a list of 100 best albums of Yugoslav pop and rock music. Five Azra albums were included, three of them in top 10. On the Radio B92's list of 100 greatest songs of former Yugoslavia, four Azra songs were included, all of them in top 20.\n\n"
