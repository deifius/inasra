"Azra was a Croatian and Yugoslav rock band that was one of the most popular acts of the Yugoslav new wave music of the 1980s. Azra was formed in 1977 by its frontman Branimir \"Johnny\" \u0160tuli\u0107. The other two members of the original line-up were Mi\u0161o Hrnjak (bass) and Boris Leiner (drums). The band is named after a verse  from \"Der Asra\" by Heinrich Heine. They are considered to be one of the most influential bands from the Yugoslav new wave rock era and the Yugoslav rock scene in general.\nThey released their first single in 1979 with songs \"Balkan\" and \"A \u0161ta da radim\". The first album named Azra was published in 1980 and achieved commercial success and popularized Azra in Yugoslavia. Their second album was released in 1981. Azra recorded its last studio album Izme\u0111u krajnosti (Between the Extremes) in 1987. In 1988 the band recorded 4LP live album under the name Zadovolj\u0161tina (Satisfaction), after which \u0160tuli\u0107 disbanded the band. \u0160tuli\u0107 recorded three more solo albums since moving to the Netherlands, where he lives in seclusion. A 2003 rock documentary, Sretno dijete depicts Azra as the focus of the rock scene in Yugoslavia during the 1980s, along with Bijelo dugme. Even today, Azra remains very popular among youth in the countries of the former Yugoslavia.\nIn 1998, the music critics compiled a list of 100 best albums of Yugoslav pop and rock music. Five Azra albums were included, three of them in top 10. On the Radio B92's list of 100 greatest songs of former Yugoslavia, four Azra songs were included, all of them in top 20.\n\n\n== Members ==\nBranimir \"Johnny\" \u0160tuli\u0107 \u2013 vocals, guitar\nBranko Matun \u2013 bass (1977)\nPaolo Sfeci \u2013 drums (1977)\nMladen Jur\u010di\u0107 \u2013 guitar (1977\u20131978)\nBranko Hromatko \u2013 drums (1977\u20131978)\nMarino Pelaji\u0107 \u2013 bass (1977\u20131978)\nJura Stubli\u0107 \u2013 vocals (1978)\nBoris Leiner (ex Kanibali) \u2013 drums, vocals (from 1979)\nMi\u0161o Hrnjak \u2013 bass (1979\u20131982)\nJurica Pa\u0111en \u2013 guitars (1983\u20131984, from 1987)\nStephen Kipp \u2013 bass (from 1986)\n\n\n=== Timeline ===\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\nAzra (Jugoton, 1980)\nSun\u010dana strana ulice (Jugoton, 1981)\nFiligranski plo\u010dnici (Jugoton, 1982)\nKad fazani lete (Jugoton, 1983)\nKrivo srastanje (Jugoton, 1984)\nIt Ain't Like In The Movies At All (Diskoton, 1986)\nIzme\u0111u krajnosti (Jugoton, 1987)\n\n\n=== Live albums ===\nRavno do dna (Jugoton, 1982)\nZadovolj\u0161tina (Jugoton, 1988)\n\n\n=== Compilation albums ===\nSingl plo\u010de 1979-1982  (Jugoton, 1982)\nKao i ju\u010der \u2013 singl plo\u010de 1983-1986  (Jugoton, 1986)\nNikom nije lep\u0161e (Hi-Fi Centar, 1998)\nThe Ultimate Collection (Croatia Records, 2007)\n\n\n=== Singles ===\n\"Balkan\" (The Balkans) / \"A \u0161ta da radim\" (And What Should I Do?) \u2013 (Jugoton 1979)\n\"Lijepe \u017eene prolaze kroz grad\" (Pretty Women Passing Through Town), \"Poziv na ples\" (An Invitation to Dance) / \"Suzy F\". \u2013 (Jugoton, 1980)\n\"\u0110oni, budi dobar\" (Johnny Be Good) / \"Te\u0161ko vrijeme\" (Hard Time) \u2013 (Jugoton 1982)\n\"E, pa \u0161to\" (So What) / \"Sloboda\" (Freedom) / \"Gluperde lutaju daleko\" (Jerks Wander Far) \u2013 (Jugoton 1982)\n\"Nemir i strast\" (Restlessness and Passion) / \"Dovi\u0111enja na Vla\u0161kom drumu\" (Farewell on the Valachian Road) \u2013 (Jugoton 1983)\nKlin\u010dek stoji pod oblokom (A Carnation Grows Under the Window ) / Flash (Jugoton 1983.) from the album \"Krivo srastanje\"\nMon ami / Duboko u tebi (My Love/Deep Inside You) (Jugoton 1984.) from the album \"Krivo srastanje\"\n\"The Balkans\" / \"Pretty Women Passing Through Town\" / \"Vondel Park\"  (Marginal Face Production 1985)\n\n\n== Videography ==\nZadovolj\u0161tina (Zagreb, live concert, 1988)\nKlincek stoji pod oblokom (Video compilation, 1990)\nDas Ist Johnny (Sarajevo, live film, 1991)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n[1] \u2013 Azra YouTube Channel"
