"The Hebrew term Abaddon (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05b2\u05d1\u05b7\u05d3\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05df\u200e Avaddon, meaning \"destruction\", \"doom\"), and its Greek equivalent Apollyon (Koin\u0113 Greek: \u1f08\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03cd\u03c9\u03bd, Apoll\u00fa\u014dn meaning \"Destroyer\") appear in the Bible as both a place of destruction and an archangel of the abyss. In the Hebrew Bible, abaddon is used with reference to a bottomless pit, often appearing alongside the place Sheol (\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05d0\u05d5\u05b9\u05dc \u0160\u0259\u02be\u014dl), meaning the realm of the dead.\nIn the Book of Revelation of the New Testament, an angel called Abaddon is described as the king of an army of locusts; his name is first transcribed in Koine Greek (Revelation 9:11\u2014\"whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon,\") as \u1f08\u03b2\u03b1\u03b4\u03b4\u03ce\u03bd, and then translated \u1f08\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03cd\u03c9\u03bd, Apollyon. The Vulgate and the Douay\u2013Rheims Bible have additional notes not present in the Greek text, \"in Latin Exterminans\", exterminans being the Latin word for \"destroyer\"."
