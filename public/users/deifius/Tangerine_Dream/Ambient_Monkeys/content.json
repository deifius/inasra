Pre-release CDs had been sold on the merchandise stall during TD's British tour in November 1997 first. The first version of the CD came with the track \"Largo (from Xerxes)\". It was released with different cover artwork in June 1998 without \"Largo (from Xerxes)\" included in the Dream Dice box set, and later also separately.
