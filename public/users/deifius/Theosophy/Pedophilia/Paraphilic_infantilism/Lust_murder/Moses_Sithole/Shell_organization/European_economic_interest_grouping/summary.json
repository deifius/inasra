"A European Economic Interest Grouping (EEIG) is a type of legal entity of the European corporate law created on 1985-07-25 under European Community (EC) Council Regulation 2137/85. It is designed to make it easier for companies in different countries to do business together, or to form consortia to take part in EU programmes. \nIts activities must be ancillary to those of its members, and, as with a partnership, any profit or loss it makes is attributed to its members. Thus, although it is liable for VAT and employees\u2019 social insurance, it is not liable to corporation tax. It has unlimited liability. It was based on the pre-existing French groupement d\u00b4int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9conomique (G.i.e.).\nSeveral thousand EEIGs now exist, active in fields as varied as agricultural marketing, legal advice, research and development, osteopathy, motorcycle preservation and cat-breeding. One of the more famous EEIGs is the Franco-German television channel ARTE. Among other EEIGs:\n\nEURESA (fr) (operational and flexible tool for cooperation and collaboration among ten European insurance companies belonging to the Social Economy)\nEurocit\u00e9 basque Bayonne - San Sebastian (fr)\n\n"
