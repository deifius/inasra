"Chazaqiel (Aramaic: \u05d6\u05d9\u05e7\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc\u200e, Ancient Greek: \u0395\u03b6\u03b5\u03ba\u03b9\u03ae\u03bb), also \u00caz\u00eaq\u00ea\u00eal, was the 8th Watcher of the 20 leaders of the 200 fallen angels that are mentioned in an ancient work called The Book of Enoch. The name means \"cloud of God\", which is fitting since it was said that Chazaqiel taught men the knowledge of the clouds, meteorology. Michael Knibb translates this angel as being the \"Shooting star of God\".\n\n\n== References =="
