"An archangel  is an angel of high rank. The word archangel itself is usually associated with the Abrahamic religions, but beings that are very similar to archangels are found in a number of religious traditions.\nThe English word archangel is derived from Greek \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u03ac\u03b3\u03b3\u03b5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2, literally 'chief angel' or 'angel of origin'. It appears only twice in the New Testament in the phrase \"with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet call of God\" (1 Thessalonians 4:16) and in relation to \"the archangel Michael\" (Jude 9). The corresponding but different Hebrew word in the Hebrew Scripture (Old Testament) is found in two places as in \"Michael, one of the chief princes\" (Dan 10:13) and in \"Michael, the great prince\" (Dan 12:1)."
