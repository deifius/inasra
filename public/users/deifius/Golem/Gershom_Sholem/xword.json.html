He is widely regarded as the founder of the modern, academic study of Kabbalah. He was  the first professor of Jewish Mysticism at Hebrew University of Jerusalem. His close friends included Theodore Adorno, Hannah Arendt, Walter Benjamin and Leo Strauss, and selected letters from his correspondence with those philosophers have been published. He was also friendly with the author Shai Agnon and the Talmudic scholar Saul Lieberman.\nScholem is best known for his collection of lectures, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (1941) and for his biography Sabbatai Zevi, the Mystical Messiah (1957). His collected speeches and essays, published as On Kabbalah and its Symbolism (1965), helped to spread knowledge of Jewish mysticism among both Jews and non-Jews.\n\n\n== Biography ==\n\nGerhard (Gershom) Scholem was born in Berlin to Arthur Scholem and Betty Hirsch Scholem. His  father was a printer. His older brother was the German Communist leader Werner Scholem. He studied Hebrew and Talmud with an Orthodox rabbi.\nScholem met Walter Benjamin in Munich in 1915, when the former was seventeen years old and the latter was twenty-three. They began a lifelong friendship that ended when Benjamin committed suicide in 1940 in the wake of Nazi persecution. Scholem dedicated his book Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (Die j\u00fcdische Mystik in ihren Hauptstr\u00f6mungen), based on lectures 1938\u20131957, to  Benjamin. In 1915 Scholem enrolled at the Frederick William University in Berlin (today, Humboldt University), where he studied mathematics, philosophy, and Hebrew. There he met Martin Buber, Shmuel Yosef Agnon, Hayim Nahman Bialik, Ahad Ha'am, and Zalman Shazar.\nIn Berlin, Scholem befriended  Leo Strauss and corresponded with him throughout his life. He studied mathematical logic at the University of Jena under Gottlob Frege. He was in Bern in 1918 with Benjamin when he met Elsa (Escha) Burchhard, who became his first wife. Scholem returned to Germany in 1919, where he received a degree in Semitic languages at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. Together with Benjamin he established a fictitious school - the  University of Muri.\nScholem wrote his doctoral thesis on the oldest known kabbalistic text, Sefer ha-Bahir. The following year it appeared in book form as \"Das Buch Bahir\", having been published by his father's publishing house.\nDrawn to Zionism and influenced by Buber, he immigrated in 1923 to the British Mandate of Palestine. He  became a librarian, heading the Department of Hebrew and Judaica at the National Library. In 1927 he revamped the Dewey Decimal System, making it appropriate for large Judaica collections. Scholem's brother Werner was a member of the ultra-left \"Fischer-Maslow Group\" and the youngest ever member of the Reichstag, representing the Communist Party (KPD) in the German parliament. He was expelled from the party and later murdered by the Nazis during the Third Reich. Gershom Scholem, unlike his brother, was vehemently opposed to both Communism and Marxism. In 1936, he married his second wife, Fania Freud. Fania, who had been his student and could read Polish, was helpful in his later research, particularly in regard to Jacob Frank.\nIn 1946 Scholem was sent by the Hebrew University to search for Jewish books that had been plundered by the Nazis and help return them to their rightful owners. He spent much of the year in Germany and Central Europe as part of this project, known as \"Otzrot HaGolah\".\nScholem died in Jerusalem, where he is buried next to his wife in the Sanhedria Cemetery. J\u00fcrgen Habermas delivered the eulogy.\n\n\n== Academic career ==\nHe became a lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Scholem taught the Kabbalah and mysticism from a scientific point of view and became the first professor of Jewish mysticism at the university in 1933, working in this post until his retirement in 1965, when he became an emeritus professor. \n\nScholem directly contrasted his historiographical approach on the study of Jewish mysticism with the approach of the 19th-century school of the Wissenschaft des Judentums (\"Science of Judaism\"), which sought to submit the study of Judaism to the discipline of subjects such as history, philology, and philosophy. According to Jeremy Adler, Scholem's thinking was \"both recognizably Jewish and deeply German,\" and \"changed the course of twentieth-century European thought.\"Jewish mysticism was seen as Judaism's weakest scholarly link. Scholem told the story of his early research when he was directed to a prominent rabbi who was an expert on Kabbalah. Seeing the rabbi's many books on the subject, Scholem asked about them, only to be told: \"This trash? Why would I waste my time reading nonsense like this?\" (Robinson 2000, p. 396)\nThe analysis of Judaism carried out by the Wissenschaft school was flawed in two ways, according to Scholem: It studied Judaism as a dead object rather than as a living organism; and it did not consider the proper foundations of Judaism, the non-rational force that, in Scholem's view, made the religion a living thing.\nIn Scholem's opinion, the mythical and mystical components were at least as important as the rational ones, and he thought that they, rather than the minutiae of Halakha, were the truly living core of Judaism. In particular, he disagreed with what he considered to be Martin Buber's personalization of Kabbalistic concepts as well as what he argued was an inadequate approach to Jewish history, Hebrew language, and the land of Israel.\nIn the Weltanschauung of Scholem, the research of Jewish mysticism could not be separated from its historical context. Starting from something similar to the Gegengeschichte of  Friedrich Nietzsche he ended up including less normative aspects of Judaism in the public history.\nSpecifically, Scholem thought that Jewish history could be divided into three periods:\n\nDuring the Biblical period, monotheism battles myth, without completely defeating it.\nDuring the Talmudic period, some of the institutions\u2014for example, the notion of the magical power of the accomplishment of the Sacraments\u2014are removed in favour of the purer concept of the divine transcendence.\nDuring the medieval period, the impossibility of reconciling the abstract concept of God of Greek philosophy with the personal God of the Bible, led Jewish thinkers, such as Maimonides, to try to eliminate the remaining myths and to modify the figure of the living God. After this time, mysticism, as an effort to find again the essence of the God of their fathers, became more widespread.The notion of the three periods, with its interactions between rational and irrational elements in Judaism, led Scholem to put forward some controversial arguments. He thought that the 17th century messianic movement, known as Sabbatianism, was developed from the Lurianic Kabbalah. In order to neutralize Sabbatianism, Hasidism had emerged as a Hegelian synthesis. Many of those who joined the Hasidic movement, because they had seen in it an Orthodox congregation, considered it scandalous that their community should be associated with a heretical movement.\nIn the same way, Scholem produced the hypothesis that the source of the 13th century Kabbalah was a Jewish gnosticism that preceded Christian gnosticism.\nThe historiographical approach of Scholem also involved a linguistic theory. In contrast to Buber, Scholem believed in the power of the language to invoke supernatural phenomena. In contrast to Walter Benjamin, he put the Hebrew language in a privileged position with respect to other languages, as the only language capable of revealing the divine truth. His special regard for the spiritual potency of the Hebrew language was expressed in his 1926 letter to Franz Rosenzweig  regarding his concerns over the \"secularization\" of Hebrew. Scholem considered the Kabbalists as interpreters of a pre-existent linguistic revelation.\n\n\n== Debate with Hannah Arendt ==\nIn the aftermath of the Eichmann trial in Jerusalem, Scholem sharply criticised Hannah Arendt's book, Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil and decried her lack of solidarity with the Jewish people (ahavath Yisrael). Arendt responded that she never loved any collective group, and that she does not love the Jewish people but was only part of them. The bitter fight, which was exchanged in various articles, made Scholem break off ties with Arendt and refuse to forgive her. Scholem wrote to Hans Paeschke that he \"knew Hannah Arendt when she was a socialist or half-communist and...when she was a Zionist. I am astounded by her ability to pronounce upon movements in which she was once so deeply engaged, in terms of a distance measured in light years and from such sovereign heights.\" Interestingly, whereas Arendt felt that Eichmann should be executed, Scholem was opposed, fearing that his execution would serve to alleviate the Germans' collective sense of guilt.\nVarious other Israeli and Jewish academics also broke off ties with Arendt, claiming that her lack of solidarity with the Jewish people in their time of need was appalling, along with her victimization of various Nazis. Before the Eichmann trial, Scholem also opposed Arendt's interpretation (in letters and the introduction to Illuminations) of Walter Benjamin as a Marxist thinker who predated the New Left. For Scholem, Benjamin had been an essentially religious thinker, whose turn to Marxism had been merely an unfortunate, but inessential and superficial, expedient.\n\n\n== Awards and recognition ==\nIn 1958, Scholem was awarded the Israel Prize in Jewish studies.\nIn 1968, he was elected president of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities.\nIn 1969, he received the Yakir Yerushalayim (Worthy Citizen of Jerusalem) award.\nIn 1977, he was awarded the Bialik Prize for Jewish thought.\n\n\n== Literary influence ==\n\nVarious stories and essays of the Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges were inspired or influenced by Scholem's books. He has also influenced ideas of Umberto Eco, Jacques Derrida, Harold Bloom, Italian  philosopher Giorgio Agamben, and George Steiner. American author Michael Chabon cites Scholem's essay, The Idea of the Golem, as having assisted him in conceiving the Pulitzer-Prize winning book The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay.\n\n\n== Selected works in English ==\nMajor Trends in Jewish Mysticism, 1941\nJewish Gnosticism, Merkabah Mysticism, and the Talmudic Tradition, 1960\nArendt and Scholem, \"Eichmann in Jerusalem: Exchange of Letters between Gershom Scholem and Hannah Arendt\", in Encounter, 22/1, 1964\nThe Messianic Idea in Judaism and other Essays on Jewish Spirituality, trans. 1971\nSabbatai Sevi: The Mystical Messiah, 1973\nFrom Berlin to Jerusalem: Memories of My Youth, 1977; trans.

The term is alternatively transliterated into English as sephirot/sephiroth, singular sefirah/sephirah etc.\nAlternative configurations of the sefirot are given by different schools in the historical development of Kabbalah, with each articulating different spiritual aspects. The tradition of enumerating 10 is stated in the Sefer Yetzirah, \"Ten sefirot of nothingness, ten and not nine, ten and not eleven\". As altogether eleven sefirot are listed across the different schemes, two (Keter and Da'at) are seen as unconscious and conscious manifestations of the same principle, conserving the ten categories. The sefirot are described as channels of divine creative life force or consciousness through which the unknowable divine essence is revealed to mankind. \nThe first sefirah, Keter, describes the divine superconscious Will that is beyond conscious intellect. The next three sefirot (Chokhmah, Binah and Da'at) describe three levels of conscious divine intellect. In particular, Da'at represents Keter in its knowable form, the concept of knowledge. Will and knowledge are corresponding somewhat dependent opposites. The seven subsequent sefirot (Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Netzach, Hod, Yesod and Malkuth) describe the primary and secondary conscious divine emotions. The sefirot of the left side and the sefira of Malkuth are feminine, as the female principle in Kabbalah describes a vessel that receives the outward male light, then inwardly nurtures and gives birth to the sefirot below them. Kabbalah sees the human soul as mirroring the divine (after Genesis 1:27, \"God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him, male and female He created them\"), and more widely, all creations as reflections of their life source in the sefirot. Therefore, the sefirot also describe the spiritual life of man, break down man's psychological processes, and constitute the conceptual paradigm in Kabbalah for understanding everything. This relationship between the soul of man and the divine gives Kabbalah one of its two central metaphors in describing divinity, alongside the other Ohr (light) metaphor. However, Kabbalah repeatedly stresses the need to avoid all corporeal interpretation. Through this, the sefirot are related to the structure of the body and are reformed into partzufim (personas). Underlying the structural purpose of each sefirah is a hidden motivational force which is understood best by comparison with a corresponding psychological state in human spiritual experience.In Hasidic philosophy, which has sought to internalise the experience of Jewish mysticism into daily inspiration (devekut), this inner life of the sefirot is explored, and the role they play in man's service of God in this world.\n\n\n== Ein Sof ==\nThe Ein Sof (lit: without end) is an important concept in Jewish Kabbalah. Generally translated as \"infinity\" and \"endless\", the Ein Sof represents the formless state of the universe before the self-materialization of God. In other words, the Ein Sof is God before he decided to become God as we now know him.The sefirot are divine emanations that come from the Ein Sof in a manner often described as a flame. The sefirot emanate from above to below. As the first Sefira is closest to Ein Sof, it is the least comprehensible to the human mind, while in turn the last is the best understood because it is closest to the material world that humanity dwells on.\n\n\n== Ten sefirot ==\nSefirot (\u05e1\u05e4\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea, sfirot, singular \u05e1\u05e4\u05d9\u05e8\u05d4 sfir\u0254), literally means \"counting, enumeration\", but early Kabbalists presented a number of other etymological possibilities from the same Hebrew root including: sefer (\"text\" - \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8), sippur (\"recounting a story\" - \u05e1\u05d9\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8), sappir (\"sapphire\" - \u05e1\u05e4\u05d9\u05e8, \"brilliance\", \"luminary\"), sfar (\"boundary\" - \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8), and sofer, or safra (\"scribe\" - \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d0, \u05e1\u05d5\u05e4\u05e8). The term sefirah thus has complex connotations within Kabbalah.The original reference to the sefirot is found in the ancient Kabbalistic text of Sefer Yetzirah, \"The Book of Formation\", attributed to the first Jewish patriarch, Abraham. However, the names of the sefirot as given in later Kabbalah are not specified there. Further references to the sefirot, now with their later-accepted names, are elaborated on in the medieval Kabbalistic text of the Zohar, which is one of the core texts of Kabbalah.\nThe sefirot are ten emanations, or illuminations of God's infinite light as it manifests in creation. As revelations of the creator's will (\u05e8\u05e6\u05d5\u05df r\u0254\u1e63on), the sefirot should not be understood as ten different \"gods\" but as ten different channels through which the one God reveals his will. In later Jewish literature, the ten sefirot refer either to the ten manifestations of God; the ten powers or faculties of the soul; or the ten structural forces of nature.In Cordoveran Kabbalah, the forces of creation are considered as autonomous forces that evolve independently of one another. By contrast, in Lurean or Lurianic Kabbalah (the Kabbalah of Isaac Luria), the sefirot are perceived as a constellation of forces in active dialogue with one another at every stage of that evolution. Luria described the sefirot as complex and dynamically interacting entities known as partzufim, each with its own symbolically human-like persona.Keter, the Crown, is the first sefirah. It is the superconscious intermediary between God and the other, conscious sefirot. Three different levels, or \"heads\", are identified within Keter. In some contexts, the highest level of Keter is called \"The unknowable head\", The second level is \"the head of nothingness\" (reisha d'ayin) and the third level is \"the long head\" (reisha d'arich). These three heads correspond to the superconscious levels of faith, pleasure and will in the soul.In its early 12th-century dissemination, Kabbalah received criticism from some rabbis who adhered to Jewish philosophy, for its alleged introduction of multiplicity into Jewish monotheism. The seeming plurality of the One God is a result of the spiritual evolution of God's light, which introduced a multiplicity of emanations from the one infinite divine essence. This was necessary due to the inability of mankind to exist in God's infinite presence. God does not change; rather, it is our ability to perceive his emanations that is modified. This is stressed in Kabbalah to avoid heretical notions of any plurality in the Godhead. One parable to explain this is the difference between the Ma'Ohr (\"Luminary\"-divine essence) and the Ohr (\"Light\") he emanates, like the difference between the single body of the sun and the multiple rays of sunlight that illuminate a room.\n\n\n=== Names in Cordoveran Kabbalah ===\nIn Kabbalah, there is a direct correspondence between the Hebrew name of any spiritual or physical phenomenon and its manifestations in the mundane world. The Hebrew name represents the unique essence of the object. This reflects the belief that the universe is created through the metaphorical speech of God, as stated in the first chapter of Genesis. Kabbalah expounds on the names of the sefirot and their nuances, including their gematria (numerical values), in order to reach an understanding of these emanations of God's essence.In the 16th-century rational synthesis of Moses ben Jacob Cordovero (Cordoveran Kabbalah), the first complete systemisation of Kabbalah, the sefirot are listed from highest to lowest:\n\n\n=== Names in Lurianic Kabbalah ===\nIn the subsequent 16th-century transcendent Kabbalistic scheme of Isaac Luria, the sefirot are usually listed by omitting Keter and including Da'at (the conscious manifestation of the superconscious Keter. This difference of opinion reflects an earlier Medieval debate regarding whether Keter is the first sefirah, or the Ohr Ein Sof (Infinite light) itself. Luria includes Keter in the list only in relation to the inner light of the sefirot. In his usual list of the sefirot as formed attributes (vessels), Keter is considered too lofty to include: In this scheme, the sefirot are depicted as lying across three parallel vertical axes.\n\n\n=== Names of the sefirot which emerged after the Sefer Yetzirah ===\nAs Aryeh Kaplan explains in his translation and commentary on the Sefer Yetzirah, \"Although the Sefer Yetzirah does not name the Ten Sefirot, their names are well known from the classical Kabbalah. ... The names of the Sefirot are all derived from scripture.\" The \"classical Kabbalah\" Kaplan refers to is above all encapsulated in the Zohar and the later works derived from it. According to those sources, the sefirot are often given diverse names, but the chiefly used terms are:\n\nKeter - \"Crown\": Divine Will to create/Infinite Light of the Creator/the Hebrew name of God \"Ehyeh Asher Ehyeh-I Am that I Am\"\nChokhmah - \"Wisdom\": First unbounded flash of an idea before it takes on limitations/male light/divine reality/first revelation/creation from nothingness\nBinah - \"Understanding\": the infinite flash of Chochmah brought into the vessel of understanding to give it grasp of breadth and depth/feminine vessel that gives birth to the emotions/reason/understanding brings teshuva return to God\nDa'at - \"Knowledge\": Central state of unity of the 10 sefirot, also called the Tree of Life.\nChesed - \"Kindness\": Loving grace of free giving/love of God/inspiring vision\nGevurah - \"Severity\": Strength/discipline/judgment/withholding/awe of God\nTiferet - \"Beauty\": Symmetry/balance between Chesed and Gevurah in compassion\nNetzach - \"Eternity\": 'perpetuity', 'victory', or 'endurance'\nHod - \"Splendor\": Withdrawal/Surrender/sincerity\nYesod - \"Foundation\": Connecting to the task to accomplish/wholly remembering/coherent knowledge\nMalkuth - \"Kingship\": Exaltedness/Humility. All the other sefirot flow into Malkuth (like the moon which has no light of its own), and it is the final revelation of the divine; the receiver and the giver\n\n\n=== Interinclusion of the sefirot ===\nThe first development that enabled the sefirot to unite in cooperation was the interinclusion within each of them of a further subset of the 10 sefirot, bringing them to a total of one hundred inter-included sefirot. In Kabbalistic interpretation, the seven emotive sefirot similarly inter-include to form 49 (seven times seven) emotional states. So, for example, Chesed contains Chesed within Chesed (loving-kindness within loving-kindness), Gevurah within Chesed (might within loving-kindness) etc. until Malkuth within Chesed (kingdom within loving-kindness). Likewise, there is Chesed within Gevurah (loving-kindness within might, typified by a restriction performed out of love, like a father punishing a child)), Gevurah within Gevurah (might within might), etc. until Malkuth within Gevurah (kingdom within might) and so on, until the 49th level, Malkuth within Malkuth (kingdom within kingdom). This is the Kabbalistic interpretation of the mitzvah (Jewish observance) of Counting of the Omer between the festivals of Passover and Shavuot. Passover commemorates the Exodus from Egypt (in Hebrew, Mitzrayim \u05de\u05e6\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd, meaning \"limitations\"), which represents the unrectified level of the psyche, which we must escape through our daily spiritual development. Shavuot commemorates the receiving of the Torah on Mount Sinai. During this 49 day period Kabbalah teaches the benefit of focusing on the aspect of the 49 inter-included sefirot that is related to each particular day of the Omer. On each day of the Omer, a person would examine each of their spiritual qualities, as a rectification process of Teshuva (Return to God), as preparation for reliving the acceptance of the Torah on Shavuot.\n\n\n== Three configurations of the sefirot ==\nTwo alternative spiritual arrangements for describing the sefirot are given, metaphorically described as \"Circles\" and \"Upright\". Their origins come from Medieval Kabbalah and the Zohar. In later, 16th-century Lurianic Kabbalah, they become systemised as two successive stages in the evolution of the sefirot, during the primordial cosmic evolution of creation. This evolution is central to the metaphysical process of tikkun (fixing) in the doctrines of Isaac Luria.\n\n\n=== Iggulim-Circles ===\n\nOne diagrammatic representation depicts the sefirot metaphorically as successively smaller concentric circles, radiating inwards from the surrounding divine omnipresence. The Four Worlds of the seder hishtalshelus (\"Chain of Progression\"), or with the addition of the highest Fifth World (Adam Kadmon), can be depicted in this diagram, starting with the highest and proceeding towards the centre of the circle to our lowest, physical realm. In each World the 10 sefirot radiate, as 10 successive steps in the downward chain of flow towards the next, lower realm. This depiction shows the successive nature of each of the 10 sefirot, as a downward chain, each more removed from divine consciousness.\nThe surrounding space in the diagram is the Infinite Divine reality (Ein Sof). The outermost circle in the teachings of Lurianic Kabbalah is the \"space\" made by the Tzimtzum in which creation unfolds. Each successive World is progressively further removed from divine revelation, a metaphorically smaller, more constricted circle. Emanation in each World proceeds down the 10 sefirot, with the last sefirah (Malchut-Actualisation of the Divine plan) of one World becoming, and being shared as, the first sefirah (Keter-The Divine Will) of the next, lower realm. The vertical line into the centre of the circle represents the path of downward emanation and constriction, from the initial first Ohr (light) of the Kav (ray) in Lurianic doctrine.\n\n\n=== Yosher-Upright ===\n\nThe most important and well known scheme of depicting the sefirot arranges them as a tree with 3 columns. The right column represents the spiritual force of expansion. The left represents its opposite, restriction. The middle column is the balance and synthesis between these opposing tendencies. The connecting lines in the diagram show the specific connections of spiritual flow between the sefirot, the \"22 Connecting Paths\", and correspond to the spiritual channels of the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Kabbalah sees the Hebrew letters as channels of spiritual life force. This derives from the account in Genesis of the creation of the World, where creation takes place through 10 Hebrew \"Sayings\" of God (\"Let there be..\"). In Kabbalistic theology, these letters remain the immanent spiritual forces that constantly recreate all existence. The paths divide into 3 categories, shown in this diagram by their different colours, corresponding to the 3 types of letter.\n\n\n=== Ish-Man ===\nAn alternate depiction of the sefirot is in the form of a man. The first sefira represents the head, the next three represent the cavities of the brain, the fourth and fifth sefirot represent the arms, the sixth sefira is the torso, the seventh and eighth are the legs, the ninth is the sexual organ, and the tenth is the all-embracing totality of this image. This man is also divided into two, with the right column being made up of the male sefirot and the left, the female sefirot.\n\n\n== The Man-metaphor in Kabbalah ==\n\nKabbalah uses subtle anthropomorphic analogies and metaphors to describe God in Judaism, both the God-world relationship, and the inner nature of the divine. These include the metaphor of the soul-body relationship, the functions of human soul-powers, the configuration of human bodily form, and female-male influences in the divine. Kabbalists repeatedly warn and stress the need to divorce their notions from any corporality, dualism, plurality, or spatial and temporal connotations. As \"the Torah speaks in the language of Man\", the empirical terms are necessarily imposed upon human experience in this world. Once the analogy is described, its limitations are then related to stripping the kernel of its husk to arrive at a truer conception. Nonetheless, Kabbalists carefully chose their terminology to denote subtle connotations and profound relationships in the divine spiritual influences. More accurately, as they see the emanation of the material world from the spiritual realms, the analogous anthropomorphisms and material metaphors themselves derive through cause and effect from their precise root analogies on High.\nDescribing the material world below in general, and humans in particular, as created in the \"image\" of the world above is not restricted in Rabbinic Judaism to Kabbalah, but abounds more widely in Biblical, Midrashic, Talmudic and philosophical literature. Kabbalah extends the Man-metaphor more radically to anthropomorphise particular divine manifestations on high, while repeatedly stressing the need to divest analogies from impure materialistic corporality. Classical proof texts on which it bases its approach include, \"From my flesh I envisage God\", and the rabbinic analogy \"As the soul permeates the whole body...sees but is not seen...sustains the whole body...is pure...abides in the innermost precincts...is unique in the body...does not eat and drink...no man knows where its place is...so the Holy One, Blessed is He...\" Together with the metaphor of light, the Man-metaphor is central in Kabbalah. Nonetheless, it too has its limitations, needs qualification, and breaks down if taken as a literal, corporeal comparison. Its limitations include the effect of the body on the soul, while the World effects no change in God; and the distinct, separate origins of the soul and the body, while in relation to God's omnipresence, especially in its acosmic Hasidic development, all creation is nullified in its source.\n\n\n=== Soul faculties and Female-Male principles ===\nThe Yosher-Upright configuration of the sefirot arranges the 10 sefirot into a Partzuf interrelationship, where each sefirah relates and mediates the influence of the others. This metaphor for divine interrelationships on High is arranged in the schematic relationship of a human soul, because alone amongst all creation, Adam-Man is held to encapsulate all harmonized forces, while animals and angels embody only singular instinctive drives. The significance of this, as well as the full meaning of the Partzufim reconfiguration of the sefirot, emerges only in 16th century Lurianic Kabbalah, where the Yosher-Upright arrangement, the Partzufim and the souls of Israel represent the secondary World of Tikun-Rectification, while angels, animals and the root origins above of the nations of the World embody the primordial World of Tohu-Chaos. Lurianic Kabbalah applies the verse, \"God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him, male and female He created them\" to this reconfigured Tikun-Yosher arrangement. In the Yosher scheme, divine principles are described through the soul faculties of man, with Binah-Understanding and Malkuth-Kingship-Shechinah-Indwelling Divine Presence, encapsulating the Divine Feminine in Creation, the principle of receiving, nurturing and pregnant internalization.\nIn Medieval Kabbalah, the task of humans is the Yichud-Union on High of the Female-Male principles of divinity, healing the apparent separation and concealment of the Shechinah female indwelling divine presence that sustains this world from the \"Holy One Blessed Be He\", the transcendent divine on high. Separation and interruption of the Shefa-Flow of divine vitality into this World is caused by human sin. Unification and revelation is opened by human benevolence, so that in Kabbalah human encapsulates the whole spiritual cosmos and upholds the Heavens. The 16th century Sefad Kabbalistic Renaissance ennacted the prayer before performing Mitzvot Jewish observances, uniting Tiferet-Beauty, central principle in the male emotions (Zeir Anpin) with Malkuth-Kingship, the feminine Shechinah:\n\nFor the sake of the union of the Holy One, Blessed Be He, and His Shechinah; to unite the name Yud and Hei, with Vav and Hei in the name of all Israel.\n\n\n=== The sefirot and the Tetragrammaton ===\nThe four Hebrew letters of God's essential divine name (known as the Tetragrammaton) correspond to the ten sefirot.\nThe letter yud (\u05d9) is depicted by a point with a cusp at its head. The point-like nature of the yud corresponds to the sefirah of chochmah, which is likened to the initial spark, or point of potential through which a new insight enters reality. The cusp, or tip of the yud reaches upwards and alludes to the super-conscious root of chochmah, which resides in Keter. The first letter hei (\u05d4) of the Tetragrammaton represents the expansion of the point of the yud into all three spatial dimensions. This corresponds to the sefirah of Binah, which expands and develops the seminal point of wisdom (chochmah) into a detailed idea. The letter vav (\u05d5) resembles a vertical line that connects the higher intellectual faculties with the emotive powers of the psyche. The gematria of the letter vav is 6, corresponding to the six emotive sefirot from loving-kindness to foundation. The final letter hei (\u05d4) of the Tetragrammaton represents the sefirah of malchut.\n\n\n=== Configuration of the body ===\n\nDespite the particular geometric depiction of the Yosher scheme, through each soul faculty in the body, physical human organs also reflect the supernal divine forces on high, as the scheme of Yosher underscores the inter-relationship of the sefirot as a unit or body. In this context, the physical upright standing of humans contrasts with the horizontal forms of animals. The correspondence of the sefirot with the physical organs of a human:\n\n\n== Lurianic Shevirah (Shattering) and Tikun (Rectification) ==\n\nIsaac Luria reinterpreted and recast the whole scheme of Kabbalah in the 16th century, essentially making the second of two different versions of the Kabbalah: the Medieval (the initial, direct understandings of the Zohar, later synthesised by Moshe Cordovero) and the Lurianic. However, he understood his new doctrine as no more than a new revelation-teaching of the true meaning of the Zohar. Lurianic Kabbalah became the dominant Kabbalistic system, displacing Cordovero's, and afterwards the Zohar was read in its light. Lurianic Kabbalists sought to integrate this with the Cordoverian scheme, seeing both as true, but describing different aspects (\"Worlds\") of the divine process.\nMedieval Kabbalah depicts a linear descending hierarchy of divine vitality, the sefirot emerging from the Ein Sof to enact creation. Lurianic Kabbalah describes enclothing processes of exile and redemption in the divine flow, where higher levels descend into lower states, as souls to spiritual bodies. The first emanation in creation leads to spiritual shattering of divinity in a definitive \"catastrophe\" (Shevirat HaKeilim - \"The Shattering of the Vessels\"), and the exile of its \"sparks\" into the descending created realms. Cordovero had reconciled previous opinions of the sefirot by describing each as divine Ohrot (\"lights\") invested in 10 spiritual Keilim (\"vessels\"), adapted by Luria to his scheme. In Lurianic Kabbalah, the first vessels of the sefirot shatter due to the sublime intensity of the light. Because each of the sefirot act as independent forces, Isaac Luria's attribution of the Iggulim (independent \"Circles\" arrangement of the sefirot) without cooperation, their immature vessels are weak. From the destruction of this primordial realm, the World of Tohu (\"Chaos\"), is built the subsequent World of Tikun (\"Rectification\"), characterized by lower lights and stronger vessels. The sublime lights of Tohu withdraw into the Ein Sof, while their sefirot vessels shatter down creation. Sparks of the original high lights remain attached in exile to the descending fragments, and the Messianic task is the redemption of all the holy sparks of Tohu. In the World of Tikun in contrast, the sefirot vessels are mature, stronger and act together in harmony. To this reformed state, Isaac Luria attributed the former Kabbalistic concepts of Yosher (harmonised \"Upright\" arrangement of the sefirot), and the many Zoharic passages expounding the Partzufim (Divine \"Personas/Configurations\"-particular Divine manifestations). This systemised the classic concept of the Partzufim as the secondary, evolved arrangements of the sefirot in Creation.\nIsaac Luria related the transition from Tohu to Tikun to Genesis 1:1-3:\n\n\"In the beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth\", the initial source in potential, from which all would unfold. \"And the earth was Chaos (Tohu) and Void (Vohu), with darkness over the surface of the deep...\", each sefirah acts independently causing the shattering (Shevirat HaKeilim). \"...And God said let there be Light\", the ability of the harmonised sefirot of Tikun to reveal Divinity and enact stable Creation.\nThe Lurianic doctrine of the shattering of the emotional sefirot vessels describes the esoteric meaning of Genesis 36:31 and I Chronicles 1:43:\n\n\"These are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before there reigned any king over the children of Israel...\"\n\nEdom is described in Genesis as the descendants of Esau. In the Kabbalistic scheme, this is identified with unrectified Gevurah - Severity, the source of the vessels of the World of Tohu - Chaos. The eight kings listed who reigned in Edom before any king of Israel, embodied the eight sefirot of Daat to Malchut in the World of Tohu, the vessels that shattered. Of each it says they lived and died, death connoting the soul-light of the sefirot ascending back to its source, while the body-vessel descends-shatters. Attached to the broken vessels are the holy residues of the former light as Nitzot - \"Sparks\" of holiness, sustaining Creation by the Divine flow of Will. The sparks are the creative force of the sefirot down the Four Worlds. The unabsorbed residue of the broken vessels in our physical, lowest World Assiah becomes the realm of Kelipot impurity. Genesis 1:2, \"...And the Spirit of God hovered over the waters.\" Merachepet - \"hovered\" splits into the number \"288 died\", the root number of Divine sparks that then subdivide into innumerable fragments.\n\n\n== Partzufim \u2013 reconfigured sefirot ==\nThe four realms of our created existence are together called the World of Tikkun (\"Fixing\"). In Tikkun, the sefirot evolve into new arrangements, where they can unite. The different realms Tikkun are characterized by lower lights and stronger vessels.Subsequent to the interinclusion of the 10 sefirot within each other, in Lurianic Kabbalah they then develop into partzufim (\"personas\"). Wide discussion of the partzufim is found in the Medieval Kabbalah of the Zohar, before Isaac Luria. In the Zohar, Shimon bar Yochai expounds upon the spiritual roles of the partzufim, by talking about them as independent spiritual manifestations. \"The Holy Ancient of Days\", or  \"The Long Visage\", two of the different Parsufim, are not just alternative adjectives for God, but are particular spiritual manifestations, levels and natures. Lurianic Kabbalah focused on the role of the Parsufim as the fully evolved stage of the primordial evolution of the sefirot, in the beginning of creation. Instead of each of the 10 sefirot merely including a full subset of 10 sefirot as latent potential forces, the first stage of their evolution, in the Parsufim the sefirot become fully autonomous and interrelated. The name of each partzuf denotes that the sefirah from which it derived, has now become an independent scheme of 10 fully functioning sefirot in the \"Upright\" (Yosher) form of \"Man\". This reconfiguration is essential in Lurianic Kabbalah to enable the opposing spiritual forces of the sefirot to work together in harmony. Each Parsuf now operates independently, and unites with the other Parsufim. So, for example, \"The Long Visage\" is said to descend, and become enclothed within the lower Parsufim. The sefirot now harmonise, to enable the Lurianic scheme of Tikkun (rectification) to begin. The names of the fundamental partzufim and their English translations:\n\n\n== Inner dimensions of the sefirot and the powers of the soul ==\n\nAs all levels of Creation are constructed around the 10 sefirot, their names in Kabbalah describe the particular role each plays in forming reality. These are the external dimensions of the sefirot, describing their functional roles in channelling the divine, creative Ohr (Light) to all levels. As the sefirot are viewed to comprise both metaphorical \"lights\" and \"vessels\", their structural role describes the particular identity each sefirah possesses from its characteristic vessel. Underlying this functional structure of the sefirot, each one possesses a hidden, inner spiritual motivation that inspires its activity. This forms the particular characteristic of inner light within each sefirah.\nUnderstanding the sefirot throughout Jewish mysticism is achieved by their correspondence to the human soul. This applies to the outer, Kabbalistic structure of the sefirot. It applies even more to their inner dimensions, which correspond to inner psychological qualities in human perception. Identifying the essential spiritual properties of the soul gives the best insight into their divine source, and in the process reveals the spiritual beauty of the soul. In Hasidic thought these inner dimensions of the sefirot are called the Powers of the Soul (Hebrew: Kochos HaNefesh\u200e). Hasidism sought the internalisation of the abstract ideas of Kabbalah, both outwardly in joyful sincerity of dveikus in daily life, acts of loving-kindness and prayer; and inwardly in its profound new articulation of Jewish mystical thought, by relating it to the inner life of man. Articulation of the sefirot in Hasidic philosophy is primarily concerned with their inner dimensions, and exploring the direct, enlivening contribution of each in man's spiritual worship of God. Kabbalah focuses on the esoteric manifestations of God in creation, the vessels of divinity. Hasidut looks at the lights that fill these vessels, how the structures reveal the divine essence, and how this inwardness can be perceived. This difference can be seen in the names of these two stages of Jewish mysticism. \"Kabbalah\" in Hebrew is derived from \"kabal\" (to \"receive\" as a vessel). \"Hasidut\" is from \"chesed\" (\"loving-kindness\"), considered the first and greatest sefirah, also called \"Greatness\", the wish to reveal and share. The names of the sefirot come from Kabbalah, and describe the Divine effect that each has upon Creation, but not their inner qualities. Hasidic thought uses new descriptive terms for the inner dimensions of the sefirot:\n\n\n== The four Worlds ==\nThese ten levels are associated with Kabbalah's four different \"Worlds\" or planes of existence, the main part from the perspective of the descending \"chain of progression\" (Seder hishtalshelut), that links the infinite divine Ein Sof with the finite, physical realm. In all Worlds, the 10 sefirot radiate, and are the divine channels through which every level is continuously created from nothing. Since they are the attributes through which the unknowable, infinite divine essence becomes revealed to the creations, all ten emanate in each World. Nonetheless, the structure of the Four Worlds arises because in each one, certain sefirot predominate. Each World is spiritual, apart from the lower aspect of the final World, which is the Asiyah Gashmi (\"Physical Asiyah\"), the physical Universe. Each World is progressively grosser and further removed from consciousness of the Divine, until in this World it is possible to be unaware of or to deny God. In descending order:\n\nWorld of Emanation (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05b2\u05e6\u05b4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5\u05bc\u05ea\u200e, Atzilut): In this level the light of the Ein Sof radiates and is united with its source. Divine Chochmah, the limitless flash of wisdom beyond grasp, predominates.\nWorld of Creation (Hebrew: \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05d0\u05b8\u05d4\u200e, Beri'ah): In this level, is the first creation ex nihilo, where the souls and angels have self-awareness, but without form. Divine Binah, the intellectual understanding, predominates.\nWorld of Formation (Hebrew: \u05d9\u05b0\u05e6\u05b4\u05d9\u05e8\u05b8\u05d4\u200e, Yetzirah): On this level, creation is related to form. The Divine emotional sefirot of Chesed to Yesod predominate.\nWorld of Action (Hebrew: \u05e2\u05b2\u05e9\u05b4\u05c2\u05d9\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4\u200e, Assiah): On this level creation is relegated to its physical aspect, the only physical realm and the lowest World, this realm with all its creatures. The Divine Kingship of Malchut predominates, the purpose of Creation.In the Zohar and elsewhere, there are these four Worlds or planes of existence. In the Lurianic system of Kabbalah, five Worlds are counted, comprising these and a higher, fifth plane, Adam Kadmon-manifest Godhead level, that mediates between the Ein Sof and the four lower Worlds.\nAs the four Worlds link the Infinite with this realm, they also enable the soul to ascend in devotion or mystical states, towards the Divine. Each World can be understood as descriptive of dimensional levels of intentionality related to the natural human \"desire to receive\", and a method for the soul's progress upward toward unity with or return to the Creator. (The terminology of this formulation is based on the exposition of Lurianic Kabbalah by the 20th century Kabbalist Yehuda Ashlag).\n\n\n== Scriptural, numerological and spiritual associations of the sefirotic tree ==\n\n\n=== Associations of the 3 columns ===\nThe sefiroth are organized into three discrete columns or gimel kavim (\"three lines\" in Hebrew).  They are often referred to as the three \"Fathers,\" are derived from the three \"Mothers,\" and are attributed to the vowels (Vav, Yud, and Heh.)  They are as follows:\n\nCentral column\n\nKether heads the central column of the tree, which is known metaphorically speaking as the \"Pillar of Mildness\" and is associated with Hebrew letter Aleph, \"the breath\", and the air element.  It is a neutral one, a balance between the two opposing forces of female and male tendencies.  Some teachings describe the sefirot on the centre pillar as gender-neutral, while others say that the sefirot vary in their sexual attributions.\nRight column (kav yamin)\nChokhmah heads the right column of the tree, metaphorically speaking the \"Pillar of Mercy\", associated with the Hebrew letter Shin, the fire element, and the male aspect;\nLeft column (kav smol)\nThe left column is headed by Binah and is called the \"Pillar of Severity.\"  It is associated with Hebrew letter Mem, the water element and the female aspect.While the pillars are each given a sexual attribution, this does not mean that every sefirah on a given pillar has the same sexual attribution as the pillar on which they sit. In Jewish Kabbalah, of all the sefirot only Binah and Malkuth are considered female, while all the other sefirot are male.Additionally (and this applies to both Jewish and Hermetic Kabbalah), each sefirah is seen as male in relation to the following sefirah in succession on the tree, and female in relation to the foregoing sefirah.\nAlternative traditions consider the grammatical genders of the words involved.  Thus, Gevurah is feminine because it has an atonal finial Heh.  Thus, Severity or Justice becomes a feminine attribute while Chesed (Mercy or Loving-kindness) becomes a masculine one, despite the modern Western tendency to genderize these terms in reverse manner.\n\n\n=== Numerological meanings ===\nIn a numerological sense, the tree of sefirot also has significance. Between the 10 sefirot run 22 channels or paths which connect them, a number which can be associated with the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet. Together the spiritual forces of the 10 sefirot and the 22 connecting channels are called the \"32 Paths of Wisdom\".\n\n\n=== Rabbinic significance ===\nAs to the actual significance of the numbers 10 and 22 in  context of Judaism goes into  Kabbalistic interpretation of Genesis. God is said to have created the world through Ten Utterances, marked by the number of times Genesis states, \"And God said.\"\n\nGen 1:3 - \"And Elohim said, 'Let there be Light.' and there was Light.\" (Kether)\nGen 1:6 - \"And Elohim said, 'Let there be a firmament in the midst of the Waters, and let it divide the Waters from the Waters.\" (Chockmah)\nGen 1:9 - \"And Elohim said, 'Let the Waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear.' And it was so.\" (Binah)\nGen 1:11 - \"And Elohim said, 'Let the Earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth.' And it was so.\" (Chesed)\nGen 1:14-15 - \"And Elohim said, 'Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth.' And it was so.\" (Gevurah)\nGen 1:20 - \"And Elohim said, 'Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.'\" (Tiferet)\nGen 1:22 - \"And Elohim Blessed them, saying, 'Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.'\" (Netzach)\nGen 1:26 - \"And Elohim said, 'Let us make People in our image, after our likeness: and let them have stewardship over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.'\" (Hod)\nGen 1:28 - \"And Elohim blessed them and Elohim said to them, 'Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and keep it: and have stewardship over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.'\" (Yesod)\nGen 1:29-30 - \"And Elohim said, 'Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat.' And it was so.\" (Malchut)As for the 22 letter-paths, there must first be an explanation of the three different types of letters in  Hebrew.\n\nThere are three \"Mothers\" (Aleph, Mem, and Shin) that represent the horizontal lines.\nTheir difference from the other letters is a matter for another article.\nThere are seven \"Doubles\" (Bet, Gimel, Dalet, Kaf, Peh, Resh, and Tav) that represent the vertical lines.\nEach double is attributed to a soft and hard sound, positive and negative meaning, direction, planet, gate of the soul, color, angels, and vowel.\nGimel, Dalet, Resh, and Tav's second pronunciations are lost or disputed, with different dialects using different sounds. Tav has no second pronunciation in Sephardi, but Ashkenazi use a 's' sound when the dagesh is absent.\nThe twelve \"Elementals\" (Heh, Vav, Zayin, Chet, Tet, Yud, Lamed, Nun, Samech, Ayin, Tzaddi, and Qof) have one pronunciation, and represent the diagonal lines.  Other sources say that they correspond to the twelve zodiacal constellations.Each letter grouping has significance in Genesis 1:\n\nThe Mothers represent the three times Genesis states \"God made.\"\nThe Doubles represent the seven times Genesis states \"God saw.\"\nThe elementals (or singles) represent the rest of the times \"God\" (Elohim in every instance of Genesis Chapter 1) is mentioned.\n\n\n== In popular culture ==\nIn the Orion's Arm Universe Project, the godlike artificial intelligences that rule humanity each identify with one of the sefirot.\nIn the Japanese anime Neon Genesis Evangelion, the Tree is shown in the opening of the show, along with other religious iconography.\nThe nine mass-production EVAs and EVA Unit 01 form a sefirot shape in the film The End of Evangelion.\nIn the Japanese manga and anime A Certain Magical Index, the tree is shown and referenced.\nYu-Gi-Oh! 5Ds: Z-ONE, the main antagonist of the final story arc in the anime, is using a set of 11 cards called \"Timelords\", where the first 10 represents the Sefirot and each named after an archangel in Judaism, and the final card (and the strongest), Sephylon, represents the tree of Sefirot itself, where all Sefirot become one (Daat).\nThe support cards are also named in Japanese \"Nonexistence Machine - Ain\", \"Endless Machine - Ain Soph\", and \"Infinite Light - Ain Soph Ohr\", named after the concept of \"Ein Sof\".\nIn the Korean video game Lobotomy Corporation, the artificial intelligences that preside over each department of the company are named after the sefirot and are called Sephirah [sic], and the departments themselves are arranged in an inverse tree.\nSephiroth is the name of the main antagonist in Final Fantasy VII. His role in the game's narrative is inspired by the tree.\nIn the first video game of The Witcher series the protagonist is sent out to search for 10 'sephirot'. These named stones each represent an attribute, listed by the game as \"Keth'aar \u2014 Crown, Chocc'mah \u2014 Wisdom, Veen'ah \u2014 Understanding, Kezath \u2014 Love, Ghe'vrath \u2014 Power, Tipperath \u2014 Compassion, Neh'tza \u2014 Victory, 'Oth \u2014 Glory, Yesath \u2014 Foundation and Maal'kad \u2014 Kingdom\"\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nEarly texts:\n\nThe Sefer Yetzirah the book of creation: In theory and practice, translated and explained by Aryeh Kaplan (1997).

The term is alternatively transliterated into English as sephirot/sephiroth, singular sefirah/sephirah etc.\nAlternative configurations of the sefirot are given by different schools in the historical development of Kabbalah, with each articulating different spiritual aspects. The tradition of enumerating 10 is stated in the Sefer Yetzirah, \"Ten sefirot of nothingness, ten and not nine, ten and not eleven\". As altogether eleven sefirot are listed across the different schemes, two (Keter and Da'at) are seen as unconscious and conscious manifestations of the same principle, conserving the ten categories. The sefirot are described as channels of divine creative life force or consciousness through which the unknowable divine essence is revealed to mankind. \nThe first sefirah, Keter, describes the divine superconscious Will that is beyond conscious intellect. The next three sefirot (Chokhmah, Binah and Da'at) describe three levels of conscious divine intellect. In particular, Da'at represents Keter in its knowable form, the concept of knowledge. Will and knowledge are corresponding somewhat dependent opposites. The seven subsequent sefirot (Chesed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Netzach, Hod, Yesod and Malkuth) describe the primary and secondary conscious divine emotions. The sefirot of the left side and the sefira of Malkuth are feminine, as the female principle in Kabbalah describes a vessel that receives the outward male light, then inwardly nurtures and gives birth to the sefirot below them. Kabbalah sees the human soul as mirroring the divine (after Genesis 1:27, \"God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him, male and female He created them\"), and more widely, all creations as reflections of their life source in the sefirot. Therefore, the sefirot also describe the spiritual life of man, break down man's psychological processes, and constitute the conceptual paradigm in Kabbalah for understanding everything. This relationship between the soul of man and the divine gives Kabbalah one of its two central metaphors in describing divinity, alongside the other Ohr (light) metaphor. However, Kabbalah repeatedly stresses the need to avoid all corporeal interpretation. Through this, the sefirot are related to the structure of the body and are reformed into partzufim (personas). Underlying the structural purpose of each sefirah is a hidden motivational force which is understood best by comparison with a corresponding psychological state in human spiritual experience.In Hasidic philosophy, which has sought to internalise the experience of Jewish mysticism into daily inspiration (devekut), this inner life of the sefirot is explored, and the role they play in man's service of God in this world."}, "Partzufim": {"links": ["Temurah ", "Shekhinah", "Torah study", "Pardes ", "Sephardic law and customs", "Isaiah Horowitz", "Free will in theology", "Malkuth", "Sephardic Judaism", "Hasidic dynasties", "Sefer Yetzirah", "Dov Ber of Mezeritch", "Sephirot", "Tree of life ", "Ohr", "Shechinah", "Baba Sali", "Atik Yomin", "Nachman of Breslov", "Yesod", "Moshe Cordovero", "Nathan Adler", "Christian Kabbalah", "Halakha", "Bahir", "Binah ", "Meir ibn Gabbai", "Safed", "Jewish angelic hierarchy", "Jewish commentaries on the Bible", "Rabbinic literature", "Ruach HaKodesh", "Oral Torah", "Lurianic Kabbalah", "Shavuot", "Baal Shem Tov", "Jewish eschatology", "Chokhmah", "Jewish studies", "Ben Ish Chai", "Tiferet", "Gershom Scholem", "Hod ", "Divine transcendence", "Written Torah", "Names of God in Judaism", "Isaac Luria", "Abraham Azulai", "Jonathan Eybeschutz", "Jewish services", "Prophecy", "Atzmus", "Asceticism in Judaism", "Christian Knorr von Rosenroth", "Vilna Gaon", "Jewish philosophy", "Joseph ben Ephraim Karo", "Tohu and Tikun", "Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil", "Kavanah", "Cordoveran Kabbalah", "Gilgul", "Shemhamphorasch", "Leah", "Lithuanian Jews", "Panentheism", "Kabbalah: Primary texts", "Jewish mysticism", "Zeir Anpin", "Old Yishuv", "Tikkun Chatzot", "Netzach", "Toledano tradition", "Shimon bar Yohai", "Tannaim", "Shlomo Eliyashiv", "Shalom Sharabi", "Chaim Joseph David Azulai", "Simeon bar Yochai", "Beit El Synagogue", "Tree of Life", "Hebrew language", "ISBN ", "Elohim", "Four Worlds", "Divine providence ", "Moshe Alshich", "Jewish views on astrology", "Kashrut", "Schisms among the Jews", "Synonymous", "Azriel ", "Aggadah", "Nusach", "Tzaddik", "Bahya ben Asher", "Kabbalah: Primary Texts", "Arich Anpin", "Menachem Mendel Schneerson", "Tzadik", "Sabbateans", "Jewish mystical exegesis", "Yitzchak Ginsburgh", "Practical Kabbalah", "Gevurah", "Keter", "Moses de Leon", "Godhead ", "Chaim Volozhin", "Seder hishtalshelut", "Atzilut", "Malchut", "Moshe Chaim Luzzatto", "Minhag", "Rabbinic Judaism", "Chokhmah ", "Notarikon", "Jewish principles of faith", "Timeline List of Jewish Kabbalists", "Shlomo Alkabetz", "Talmudical hermeneutics", "Heichalot", "Teshuvah", "God in Judaism", "Musar literature", "Mitzvah", "Shevirah", "Isaac the Blind", "Tohu ", "Kabbalah", "Neo-Hasidism", "Nusach Ashkenaz", "Talmud", "Shimon bar Yochai", "Tzadikim Nistarim", "Mikveh", "Zohar", "Divine immanence", "Mitzvot", "Yehuda Ashlag", "Lag BaOmer", "Devekut", "Sephirot ", "Shtetl", "Anthropomorphism in Kabbalah", "Jewish meditation", "Chassidei Ashkenaz", "Thirteen Attributes of Mercy", "Ayin and Yesh", "Ab ", "Hasidic philosophy", "Rachel", "Abraham Abulafia", "Shlomo Halevi Alkabetz", "Jacob", "Yeridat ha-dorot", "Nahmanides", "Yom Hillula", "Gematria", "Tzimtzum", "Ohel ", "Idra", "Joseph ben Abraham Gikatilla", "Merkabah", "Chaim ibn Attar", "Baal Shem", "Hasidic Judaism", "Qliphoth", "Tanakh", "Abraham Isaac Kook", "six thirteen commandments", "Chaim Vital", "Chesed", "Judah Loew ben Bezalel", "Tetragrammaton", "Menahem Recanati", "Ein Sof", "Tikun ", "Torah", "Schneur Zalman of Liadi", "Midrash"], "content": "Partzufim/Partsufim (Hebrew: \u05e4\u05e8\u05e6\u05d5\u05e4\u05d9\u05dd\u200e, singular partzuf, Hebrew: \u05e4\u05e8\u05e6\u05d5\u05e3\u200e), meaning Divine \"Personae/Visages/Faces/Forms/Configurations\", are particular reconfigured arrangements of the ten sephirot (Divine attributes/emanations of Kabbalah). Each partzuf is thus a configuration of disparate entities into a harmonious unit. The names of the partzufim are derived from the Zohar, the foundational text of Kabbalah. There, they  are synonymous terms for the sefirot. Their full doctrinal significance emerged in 16th century Lurianic Kabbalah with reference to the cosmic processes of Shevirah-\"Shattering\" and Tikun-\"Rectification.\"\nMedieval Kabbalah described the ten sefirot as divine channels that emanate from their source and descend in a linear progression. Moshe Cordovero systemised the different Medieval interpretations of the Zohar. Later, Isaac Luria recast Kabbalah into its second articulation. \"Lurianic Partzufim\" describe the dynamic relationships between personae, which interact with each other. The higher partzufim enclothe themselves within the lower ones, as a soul is enclothed in a body.\nAccording to the Lurianic system, the linear scheme of sefirot precipitates the \"shattering\" of Tohu- \"the World of Chaos.\" Their reformation as partzufim in the World of Atzilut, or Rectification, begins cosmic repair.\nAs a result of the collapse of the World of Chaos, sparks of holiness were lost, or exiled, in the three lower Worlds. Man, whose soul reflects the harmonised order of partzufim, rectifies the mundane world by redeeming the exiled sparks of holiness through Torah study and performance of mitzvot.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nIn Lurianic Kabbalah, the four realms of our created existence are arranged in a stable form, through the reconfiguration of the original sephirot into partzufim. The first realm to exhibit this new arrangement is the mature form of Atzilut (the World of \"Emanation\"), therefore also called the \"World of Tikun\" (Rectification). This follows on from the Shevirah (\"Shattering\") of the sefirot vessels in the \"World of Tohu\" (Chaos), the initial, unstable form of Atzilut. In Tikun, the Sefirot evolve into the harmonised partzufim new arrangements, where they can unite. The realm of Tohu is characterised by abundant light (Ohr) and weak vessels, as the 10 sefirot act independently as absolute forces, causing it to collapse. Tikkun is characterised by lower lights in strong vessels, as through the partzufim the sefirot inter-relate to absorb the illumination from Tohu.\nInstead of each sefirah merely including a full subset of 10 sefirot as latent potential forces, the first stage of their evolution in the Lurianic scheme, in the partzufim the sefirot become full autonomous arrangements where all 10 sefirot are active forces of intellectual and emotional powers arranged around one of their number, analogous to the Yosher (\"Upright\") human-like configuration of the sephirot in three columns. They can now interact with the other partzufim, becoming enclothed within them in dynamic interaction. For example, Arich Anpin, the Partzuf of Keter-Will means the \"Long/Extended Face\" as it acts as the foundational Divine Will within Creation, extending down through subsequent partzufim, sefirot and Worlds, though in successively more concealed mode. The task of man becomes the rectification of the fallen sparks of Tohu, the concealed sublime origins of lower Creation, latently active in their exiled state. The messianic goal is the union of the original great illumination of Tohu within mature vessels of Tikun, revealing the ultimate divine essence of both.\n\n\n=== Anthropomorphism of the partzufim ===\n\nAs Medieval Kabbalists never tire of stressing the unity and non-plurality in the concept of the sefirot, so Luria stressed the metaphorical nature of the partzufim. They are Divine \"faces\", manifestations of the Godhead, alternative aspects through which God manifests Himself, and do not imply any plurality in God. As Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai recounts in the Zohar:\n\nWhatever I said of the Atika Kadisha, Holy Ancient-One, and whatever I said of the Zeir Anpin, is all One; everything is absolutely One. There is no division in Him, blessed be He and blessed be His Name forever. The sum of all this is: the Ancient of the Ancient and the Zeir Anpin are absolutely One. All is, was, and shall be; He will not change, He is unchanging, and he has not changed...Should you ask, what then is the difference between one and the other? It is all One, but from above His paths divide and from below judgement is found; from our perspective they differ one from another.\n\n\n== Primary and Secondary partzufim ==\nThe 10 sephirot develop into 5/6 primary partzufim, which further develop into pairs of Male and Female secondary partzufim. The male principle in Kabbalah metaphorically denotes outward/emanator/giver, and the female principle denotes inward/receiver/nurturer, similar to the female process of pregnancy to nurture subsequent emanation. The terminology and system of partzufim describes detailed and specific aspects of Divinity, their nature and function discussed in Kabbalah.\n\n\n=== Primary partzufim ===\nThe fundamental primary partzufim and the sefirot they develop from are:\n\nAtik Yomin-\"Ancient of Days\", supreme \"earliest/oldest\" inner dimension of Keter Will from Ein Sof)\nArich Anpin-\"Long Face/Extending Patience\", infinitely extending downwards source of divine compassion in Keter Will\nAbba-\"Father\", Chokhmah illumination of Wisdom insight, root of intellect on the \"right\" of the sefirot (Revelation)\nImma-\"Mother\", Binah intellectual Understanding nurturing pregnant emotions, on the \"left\" side of the sefirot (Internalisation)\nZeir Anpin-\"Small Face/Short Patience\", Son, 6 sefirot emotions that shattered, born from Imma on \"left\" side (Judgement)\nNukvah-\"Female\" of Zeir Anpin, Daughter, Malkuth reign in Feminine Shekhinah, born from Zeir Anpin on \"left\", man reunites\n\n\n=== Full array of partzufim ===\nThe full array of primary partzufim and the secondary partzufim that develop from them:\n\nBoth of the secondary, male and female partzufim of Atik Yomin and Arich Anpin exist within the same configuration. There are therefore only 10 distinct secondary partzufim, and consequently the secondary partzufim of Keter do not have particular names, unlike the secondary partzufim of the other sefirot.\n\n\n== Manifestations ==\nThe 6 primary and 12 secondary partzufim are the basic harmonised Divine manifestations in the Four Worlds of created existence. More specifically however, within their interaction are numerous more particular aspects of Divinity, each denoting a differentiated expression. In the Idrot narratives of the Zohar, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai discusses profound manifestations of the partzufim. The Idra Zuta, traditionally ascribed to his day of passing from this world, his Yom Hillula \"wedding day\", is considered the deepest teachings of the Zohar.\n\n\n== Image gallery ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nAnthropomorphism in Kabbalah\nIdra\nIsaac Luria\nSephirot\nTohu and Tikun\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nGlossary of Kabbalah and Chassidut Letter P\nThe Stages of the Creative Process from God's Infinite Light to Our Physical World from www.inner.org.

Each partzuf is thus a configuration of disparate entities into a harmonious unit. The names of the partzufim are derived from the Zohar, the foundational text of Kabbalah. There, they  are synonymous terms for the sefirot. Their full doctrinal significance emerged in 16th century Lurianic Kabbalah with reference to the cosmic processes of Shevirah-\"Shattering\" and Tikun-\"Rectification.\"\nMedieval Kabbalah described the ten sefirot as divine channels that emanate from their source and descend in a linear progression. Moshe Cordovero systemised the different Medieval interpretations of the Zohar. Later, Isaac Luria recast Kabbalah into its second articulation. \"Lurianic Partzufim\" describe the dynamic relationships between personae, which interact with each other. The higher partzufim enclothe themselves within the lower ones, as a soul is enclothed in a body.\nAccording to the Lurianic system, the linear scheme of sefirot precipitates the \"shattering\" of Tohu- \"the World of Chaos.\" Their reformation as partzufim in the World of Atzilut, or Rectification, begins cosmic repair.\nAs a result of the collapse of the World of Chaos, sparks of holiness were lost, or exiled, in the three lower Worlds. Man, whose soul reflects the harmonised order of partzufim, rectifies the mundane world by redeeming the exiled sparks of holiness through Torah study and performance of mitzvot."}, "Zohar": {"links":

It is a group of books including commentary on the mystical aspects of the Torah (the five books of Moses) and scriptural interpretations as well as material on mysticism, mythical cosmogony, and mystical psychology. The Zohar contains discussions of the nature of God, the origin and structure of the universe, the nature of souls, redemption, the relationship of Ego to Darkness and \"true self\" to \"The Light of God\". Its scriptural exegesis can be considered an esoteric form of the rabbinic literature known as Midrash, which elaborates on the Torah.\n\n\n== Language ==\nThe Zohar is mostly written in what has been described as a cryptic, obscure style of Aramaic. Aramaic, the day-to-day language of Israel in the Second Temple period (539 BCE \u2013 70 CE), was the original language of large sections of the biblical books of Daniel and Ezra, and is the main language of the Talmud. However, in the Late Middle Ages, the language was used among Jews exclusively in the study of such earlier texts. Some academic scholars assert that the Aramaic of the Zohar appears to be written by someone who did not know Aramaic as a native language and that words from Andalusi Romance and Galician-Portuguese can be found in the text.\n\n\n== Origin and history ==\nThe Zohar first appeared in Spain, then the Kingdom of Leon, in the 13th century. It was published by a Jewish writer named Moses de Le\u00f3n (c. 1240\u20131305). De Le\u00f3n ascribed the work to Shimon bar Yochai (\"the Rashbi\"), a tanna active after the Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE) and the destruction of the Second Temple during the protracted period known as the Jewish\u2013Roman wars. According to Jewish legend, Shimon hid in a cave for thirteen years studying the Torah and was inspired by the Prophet Elijah to write the Zohar. This accords with the traditional claim by adherents that Kabbalah is the concealed part of the Oral Torah.\n\n\n== Acceptance within Judaism ==\nWhile the traditional majority view in Judaism has been that the teachings of Kabbalah were revealed by God to Biblical figures such as Abraham and Moses and were then transmitted orally from the Biblical era until their redaction by Shimon bar Yochai, modern academic analysis of the Zohar, including that by the 20th century religious historian Gershom Scholem, has theorized that Moses de Le\u00f3n was the actual author. Aryeh Kaplan posited a theory that there was an ancient core text of the Zohar which antedated de L\u00e9on, but that several strata of text were added over time.\nThe view of some non-Chasidic Orthodox Jews and Orthodox groups, as well as non-Orthodox Jewish denominations, generally conforms to Scholem's view, and as such, most such groups have long viewed the Zohar as pseudepigrapha and apocrypha, while sometimes accepting that its contents may have meaning for modern Judaism. The Dor Daim reject the Zohar outright, while the Spanish and Portuguese Jewish community removed all Zohar-related content from their siddurs and liturgy in the aftermath of Sabbatai Zevi's apostasy to Islam. Selected Zohar-related elements have been restored in several more recent Spanish and Portuguese siddurs, even for communities which have not restored those elements to their liturgy.  \nSiddurs edited by non-Orthodox Jews may therefore contain excerpts from the Zohar and other kabbalistic works, even if the editors do not literally believe that they are oral traditions from the time of Moses.\n\n\n== Impact outside Judaism ==\nThere are people of religions besides Judaism, or even those without religious affiliation, who delve in the Zohar out of curiosity, or as a means of seeking meaningful and practical answers about the meaning of their lives, the purpose of creation and existence and their relationships with the laws of nature, and so forth; however from the perspective of traditional, rabbinic Judaism, \nand by the Zohar's own statements, \nthe purpose of the Zohar is to help the Jewish people through and out of the Exile and to infuse the Torah and mitzvot (Judaic commandments) with the wisdom of Moses de Le\u00f3n's Kabbalah for its Jewish readers.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn the Bible, the word \"Zohar\" appears in the vision of Ezekiel 8:2 and is usually translated as meaning radiance or light. It appears again in Daniel 12:3, \"Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens\".\n\n\n== Authorship ==\n\n\n=== Initial view ===\n\nSuspicions aroused by the facts that the Zohar was discovered by one person and that it refers to historical events of the post-Talmudic period while purporting to be from an earlier time, which caused the authorship to be questioned from the outset. Joseph Jacobs and Isaac Broyde, in their article on the Zohar for the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia, cite a story involving the Kabbalist Isaac of Acco, who is supposed to have heard directly from the widow of de Le\u00f3n that her husband proclaimed authorship by Shimon bar Yochai for profit:\n\nA story tells that after the death of Moses de Leon, a rich man of Avila named Joseph offered Moses' widow (who had been left without any means of supporting herself) a large sum of money for the original from which her husband had made the copy. She confessed that her husband himself was the author of the work. She had asked him several times, she said, why he had chosen to credit his own teachings to another, and he had always answered that doctrines put into the mouth of the miracle-working Shimon bar Yochai would be a rich source of profit. The story indicates that shortly after its appearance the work was believed by some to have been written by Moses de Leon.\nIsaac's testimony, which appeared in the first edition (1566) of Sefer Yuchasin, was censored from the second edition (1580) and remained absent from all editions thereafter until its restoration nearly 300 years later in the 1857 edition.Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan states that Isaac evidently did not believe her since Isaac wrote that the Zohar was authored by Rabbi Shimon bar Yohai in a manuscript in Kaplan's possession. This leads him to hypothesize that Moses de Le\u00f3n's wife sold the original manuscript, as parchment was very valuable, and was embarrassed by the realization of its high ancient worth, leading her to claim it was written by her husband. Kaplan concludes saying this was the probable series of events.The Zohar spread among the Jews with remarkable swiftness. Scarcely fifty years had passed since its appearance in Spain before it was quoted by many Kabbalists, including the Italian mystical writer Menahem Recanati and by Todros Abulafia. Certain Jewish communities, however, such as the Dor Daim, Andalusian (Western Sefardic or Spanish and Portuguese Jews), and some Italian communities, never accepted it as authentic. The manuscripts of Zohar are from around the 14th and 16th centuries.\n\n\n=== Late Middle Ages ===\nBy the 15th century, its authority in the Spanish Jewish community was such that Joseph ibn Shem-Tov drew from it arguments in his attacks against Maimonides, and even representatives of non-mystical Jewish thought began to assert its sacredness and invoke its authority in the decision of some ritual questions. In Jacobs' and Broyde's view, they were attracted by its glorification of man, its doctrine of immortality, and its ethical principles, which they saw as more in keeping with the spirit of Talmudic Judaism than are those taught by the philosophers, and which was held in contrast to the view of Maimonides and his followers, who regarded man as a fragment of the universe whose immortality is dependent upon the degree of development of his active intellect. The Zohar instead declared Man to be the lord of the creation, whose immortality is solely dependent upon his morality.Conversely, Elijah Delmedigo (c.1458 \u2013 c.1493), in his Bechinat ha-Dat endeavored to show that the Zohar could not be attributed to Shimon bar Yochai, by a number of arguments. He claims that if it were his work, the Zohar would have been mentioned by the Talmud, as has been the case with other works of the Talmudic period; he claims that had bar Yochai known by divine revelation the hidden meaning of the precepts, his decisions on Jewish law from the Talmudic period would have been adopted by the Talmud, that it would not contain the names of rabbis who lived at a later period than that of bar Yochai; he claims that if the Kabbalah were a revealed doctrine, there would have been no divergence of opinion among the Kabbalists concerning the mystic interpretation of the precepts.Believers in the authenticity of the Zohar countered that the lack of references to the work in Jewish literature was because bar Yohai did not commit his teachings to writing but transmitted them orally to his disciples over generations until finally the doctrines were embodied in the Zohar. They found it unsurprising that bar Yochai should have foretold future happenings or made references to historical events of the post-Talmudic period.The authenticity of the Zohar was accepted by such 16th century Jewish luminaries as R' Yosef Karo (d.1575), R' Moses Isserles (d. 1572), and R' Solomon Luria (d.1574), who wrote that Jewish law (Halacha) follows the Zohar, except where the Zohar is contradicted by the Babylonian Talmud. However, R' Luria admits that the Zohar cannot override a minhag.\n\n\n=== Enlightenment period ===\n\nDebate continued over the generations; Delmedigo's arguments were echoed by Leon of Modena (d.1648) in his Ari Nohem, and a work devoted to the criticism of the Zohar, Mitpachas Sefarim, was written by Jacob Emden (d.1776), who, waging war against the remaining adherents of the Sabbatai Zevi movement (in which Zevi, a false messiah and Jewish apostate, cited Messianic prophecies from the Zohar as proof of his legitimacy), endeavored to show that the book on which Zevi based his doctrines was a forgery. Emden argued that the Zohar misquotes passages of Scripture; misunderstands the Talmud; contains some ritual observances that were ordained by later rabbinical authorities; mentions The Crusades against Muslims (who did not exist in the 2nd century); uses the expression \"esnoga\", a Portuguese term for \"synagogue\"; and gives a mystical explanation of the Hebrew vowel points, which were not introduced until long after the Talmudic period.In the Ashkenazi community of Eastern Europe, religious authorities including the Vilna Gaon (d.1797) and Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi (d.1812) (The Baal HaTanya) believed in the authenticity of the Zohar. Acceptance was not uniform, however. The Noda Bihudah (d.1793), in his sefer Derushei HaTzlach, argued that the Zohar is to be considered unreliable as it came into our hands many hundreds of years after Rashbi's death and it lacks an unbroken mesorah as to its authenticity, among other reasons.The influence of the Zohar and the Kabbalah in Yemen, where it was introduced in the 17th century, contributed to the formation of the Dor Deah movement, led by Rabbi Yi\u1e25yeh Qafe\u1e25 in the later part of the 19th century, whose adherents believed that the core beliefs of Judaism were rapidly diminishing in favor of the mysticism of the Kabbalah. Among its objects was the opposition of the influence of the Zohar and subsequent developments in modern Kabbalah, which were then pervasive in Yemenite Jewish life, restoration of what they believed to be a rationalistic approach to Judaism rooted in authentic sources, and the safeguarding of the older (\"Baladi\") tradition of Yemenite Jewish observance that preceded the Kabbalah. Especially controversial were the views of the Dor Daim on the Zohar, as presented in Milhamoth Hashem (Wars of the Lord), written by Rabbi Qafe\u1e25. A group of Jerusalem rabbis published an attack on Rabbi Qafe\u1e25 under the title of Emunat Hashem (Faith of the Lord), taking measures to ostracize members of the movement; notwithstanding, not even the Yemenite rabbis who opposed the dardaim heeded this ostracization. Instead, they intermarried, sat together in batei midrash, and continued to sit with Rabbi Qafe\u1e25 in beth din.\n\n\n=== Contemporary religious view ===\n\nMost of Orthodox Judaism holds that the teachings of Kabbalah were transmitted from teacher to teacher, in a long and continuous chain, from the Biblical era until its redaction by Shimon bar Yochai. Some fully accept the claims that the Kabbalah's teachings are in essence a revelation from God to the Biblical patriarch Abraham, Moses and other ancient figures, but were never printed and made publicly available until the time of the Zohar's medieval publication. The greatest acceptance of this sequence of events is held within Haredi Judaism, especially Chasidic groups. R' Yechiel Michel Epstein (d.1908), and R' Yisrael Meir Kagan (d.1933) both believed in the authenticity of the Zohar. Rabbis Eliyahu Dessler (d.1953) and Gedaliah Nadel (d.2004) maintained that it is acceptable to believe that the Zohar was not written by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and that it had a late authorship.Within Orthodox Judaism the traditional view that Shimon bar Yochai was the author is prevalent. R' Menachem Mendel Kasher in a 1958 article in the periodical Sinai argues against the claims of Gershom Scholem that the Zohar was written in the 13th Century by R' Moses de Le\u00f3n. He writes:\n\nMany statements in the works of the Rishonim (medieval commentors who preceded de Le\u00f3n) refer to Medrashim that we are not aware of. He writes that these are in fact references to the Zohar. This has also been pointed out by R' David Luria in his work \"Kadmus Sefer Ha'Zohar\".\nThe Zohar's major opponent Elijah Delmedigo refers to the Zohar as having existed for \"only\" 300 years. Even he agrees that it was extant at the time of R' Moses de Le\u00f3n.\nHe cites a document from R' Yitchok M' Acco who was sent by the Ramban to investigate the Zohar. The document brings witnesses that attest to the existence of the manuscript.\nIt is impossible to accept that R' Moses de Le\u00f3n managed to forge a work within the scope of the Zohar (1700 pages) within a period of six years as Scholem claims.\nA comparison between the Zohar and de Le\u00f3n's other works show major stylistic differences. Although he made use of his manuscript of the Zohar, many ideas presented in his works contradict or ignore ideas mentioned in the Zohar. Luria also points this out.\nMany of the Midrashic works achieved their final redaction in the Geonic period. Some of the anachronistic terminologies of the Zohar may date from that time.\nOut of the thousands of words used in the Zohar, Scholem finds two anachronistic terms and nine cases of ungrammatical usage of words. This proves that the majority of the Zohar was written within the accepted time frame and only a small amount was added later (in the Geonic period as mentioned).\nSome hard to understand terms may be attributed to acronyms or codes. He finds corollaries to such a practice in other ancient manuscripts.\nThe \"borrowings\" from medieval commentaries may be explained in a simple manner. It is not unheard of that a note written on the side of a text should on later copying be added to the main part of the text. The Talmud itself has Geonic additions from such a cause. Certainly, this would apply to the Zohar to which there did not exist other manuscripts to compare it with.\nHe cites an ancient manuscript that refers to a book Sod Gadol that seems to in fact be the Zohar.Concerning the Zohar's lack of knowledge of the land of Israel, Scholem bases this on the many references to a city Kaputkia (Cappadocia) which he states was situated in Turkey, not in Israel.\nAnother theory as to the authorship of the Zohar is that it was transmitted like the Talmud before it was transcribed: as an oral tradition reapplied to changing conditions and eventually recorded. This view believes that the Zohar was not written by Shimon bar Yochai, but is a holy work because it consisted of his principles.\nBelief in the authenticity of the Zohar among Orthodox Jewish movements can be seen in various forms online today. Featured on Chabad.org is the multi-part article, The Zohar's Mysterious Origins by Moshe Miller, which views the Zohar as the product of multiple generations of scholarship but defends the overall authenticity of the text and argues against many of the textual criticisms from Scholem and Tishby. The Zohar figures prominently in the mysticism of Chabad. Another leading Orthodox online outlet, Aish.com, also shows broad acceptance of the Zohar by referencing it in many of its articles.Jews in non-Orthodox Jewish denominations accept the conclusions of historical academic studies on the Zohar and other kabbalistic texts. As such, most non-Orthodox Jews have long viewed the Zohar as pseudepigraphy and apocrypha. Nonetheless, many accepted that some of its contents had meaning for modern Judaism. Siddurim edited by non-Orthodox Jews often have excerpts from the Zohar and other kabbalistic works, e.g. Siddur Sim Shalom edited by Jules Harlow, even though the editors are not kabbalists.\nIn recent years there has been a growing willingness of non-Orthodox Jews to study the Zohar, and a growing minority have a position that is similar to the Modern Orthodox position described above. This seems pronounced among Jews who follow the path of Jewish Renewal.\n\n\n=== Modern critical views ===\nThe first systematic and critical academic proof for the authorship of Moses de Le\u00f3n was given by Adolf Jellinek in his 1851 monograph \"Moses ben Shem-tob de Le\u00f3n und sein Verh\u00e4ltnis zum Sohar\" and later adopted by the historian Heinrich Graetz in his \"History of the Jews\", vol. 7. The young kabbalah scholar Gershom Scholem began his career at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem with a famous lecture in which he promised to refute Graetz and Jellinek, but after years of strained research Gershom Scholem contended in 1941 that de Le\u00f3n himself was the most likely author of the Zohar. Among other things, Scholem noticed the Zohar's frequent errors in Aramaic grammar, its suspicious traces of Spanish words and sentence patterns, and its lack of knowledge of the land of Israel.\nOther Jewish scholars have also suggested the possibility that the Zohar was written by a group of people, including de Le\u00f3n. This theory generally presents de Le\u00f3n as having been the leader of a mystical school, whose collective effort resulted in the Zohar.\nEven if de Le\u00f3n wrote the text, the entire contents of the book may not be fraudulent. Parts of it may be based on older works, and it was a common practice to ascribe the authorship of a document to an ancient rabbi in order to give the document more weight. It is possible that Moses de Le\u00f3n considered himself to be channeling the words of Rabbi Shimon.\nIn the Encyclopaedia Judaica article written by Professor Gershom Scholem of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem there is an extensive discussion of the sources cited in the Zohar. Scholem views the author of the Zohar as having based the Zohar on a wide variety of pre-existing Jewish sources, while at the same time inventing a number of fictitious works that the Zohar supposedly quotes, e.g., the Sifra de-Adam, the Sifra de-Hanokh, the Sifra di-Shelomo Malka, the Sifra de-Rav Hamnuna Sava, the Sifra de-Rav Yeiva Sava, the Sifra de-Aggadeta, the Raza de-Razin and many others.\nScholem's views are widely held as accurate among historians of the Kabbalah, but like all textual historical investigations, are not uncritically accepted; most of the following conclusions are still accepted as accurate, although academic analysis of the original texts has progressed dramatically since Scholem's ground-breaking research. Scholars who continue to research the background of the Zohar include Yehuda Liebes (who wrote his doctorate thesis for Scholem on the subject, Dictionary of the Vocabulary of the Zohar in 1976), and Daniel C. Matt, also a student of Scholem's who has  reconstructed a critical edition of the Zohar based on original, unpublished manuscripts.\nWhile many original ideas in the Zohar are presented as being from (fictitious) Jewish mystical works, many ancient and clearly rabbinic mystical teachings are presented without their real, identifiable sources' being named. Academic studies of the Zohar show that many of its ideas are based in the Talmud, various works of midrash, and earlier Jewish mystical works. Scholem writes:\n\nThe writer had expert knowledge of the early material and he often used it as a foundation for his expositions, putting into it variations of his own. His main sources were the Babylonian Talmud, the complete Midrash Rabbah, the Midrash Tanhuma, and the two Pesiktot (Pesikta De-Rav Kahana or Pesikta Rabbati), the Midrash on Psalms, the Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer, and the Targum Onkelos. Generally speaking, they are not quoted exactly, but translated into the peculiar style of the Zohar and summarized....... Less use is made of the halakhic Midrashim, the Jerusalem Talmud, and the other Targums, nor of the Midrashim like the Aggadat Shir ha-Shirim, the Midrash on Proverbs, and the Alfabet de-R. Akiva. It is not clear whether the author used the Yalkut Shimoni, or whether he knew the sources of its aggadah separately. Of the smaller Midrashim he used the Heikhalot Rabbati, the Alfabet de-Ben Sira, the Sefer Zerubabel, the Baraita de-Ma'aseh Bereshit, [and many others]...The author of the Zohar drew upon the Bible commentaries written by medieval rabbis, including Rashi, Abraham ibn Ezra, David Kimhi and even authorities as late as Nahmanides and Maimonides. Scholem gives a variety of examples of such borrowings.\nThe Zohar draws upon early mystical texts such as the Sefer Yetzirah and the Bahir, and the early medieval writings of the Hasidei Ashkenaz.\nAnother influence on the Zohar that Scholem, and scholars like Yehudah Liebes and Ronit Meroz have identified was a circle of Spanish Kabbalists in Castile who dealt with the appearance of an evil side emanating from within the world of the sephirot. Scholem saw this dualism of good and evil within the Godhead as a kind of \"gnostic\" inclination within Kabbalah, and as a predecessor of the Sitra Ahra (the other, evil side) in the Zohar. The main text of the Castile circle, the Treatise on the Left Emanation, was written by Jacob ha-Cohen in around 1265.\n\n\n== Contents ==\n\n\n=== Printings, editions, and indexing ===\nThe Tikunei haZohar was first printed in Mantua in 1557. The main body of the Zohar was printed in Cremona in 1558 (a one-volume edition), in Mantua in 1558-1560 (a three-volume edition), and in Salonika in 1597 (a two-volume edition). Each of these editions included somewhat different texts. When they were printed there were many partial manuscripts in circulation that were not available to the first printers. These were later printed as \"Zohar Chadash\" (lit. \"New Zohar\"), but Zohar Chadash actually contains parts that pertain to the Zohar, as well as Tikunim (plural of Tikun, \"Repair\") that are akin to Tikunei haZohar, as described below. The term \"Zohar\", in usage, may refer to just the first Zohar collection, with or without the applicable sections of Zohar Chadash, or to the entire Zohar and Tikunim.\nCitations referring to the Zohar conventionally follow the volume and page numbers of the Mantua edition; while citations referring to Tikkunei haZohar follow the edition of Ortakoy (Constantinople) 1719 whose text and pagination became the basis for most subsequent editions.  Volumes II and III begin their numbering anew, so citation can be made by parashah and page number (e.g. Zohar: Nasso 127a), or by volume and page number (e.g. Zohar III:127a).\n\n\n=== Zohar ===\nThe earlier part of the Zohar, also known as Zohar 'Al haTorah (Zohar on the Torah, \u05d6\u05d5\u05d4\u05e8 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d4\u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4) or Midrash Rashbi, contains several smaller \"books\", as described below.\nThis book was published in three volumes: Volume 1 on Bereishit (Genesis), Volume 2 on Shemot (Exodus) and Volume 3 on Vayikra, Bamidbar and Devarim (Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy). At the start of the first volume is printed a \"Preface to the Book of the Zohar\" (pages 1a to 14b). After this introduction is the Zohar's commentary on most of the parashahs of the Torah. There is Zohar on all of the parashahs of Bereishit through the book of Vayikra; in Bamidbar there is no Zohar on the last two parashas: Matot (although on this parashah there is a small paragraph on page 259b) and Mas'ei. In Devarim there is no Zohar on Devarim, Re'eh, Ki-Tavo, Nitzavim, and veZot haBerakhah. Printed within these three volumes are these smaller books:Sifra diTzni'uta/Book of the Hidden (\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d3\u05e6\u05e0\u05d9\u05e2\u05d5\u05ea\u05d0)\nThis small \"book\", three pages long (Volume 2, parashat Teruma, pages 176b-179a), the name of which, \"Book of the Hidden\", attests to its veiled and cryptic character, is considered by some an important and concentrated part of the Zohar. Its enumerations and anatomical references are reminiscent of the Sefer Yetzirah, the latter being remazim (hints) of divine characteristics.\nExternally it is a commentary on seminal verses in Bereishit (and therefore in the version published in Cremona it is printed in parashat Bereishit). It has five chapters. Intrinsically it includes, according to Rashbi, the foundation of Kabbalah, which is explained at length in the Zohar and in the books of Kabbalah after it. Rabbi Shalom Buzaglo said, \"Rashbi \u2013 may his merit protect us \u2013 said (Zohar Vol. 2, page 176a), Sifra diTzni'uta is five chapters that are included in a Great Palace and fill the entire earth,' meaning, these five paragraphs include all the wisdom of Kabbalah... for, Sifra diTzni'uta is the 'little that holds the much'; brevity with wonderful and glorious wisdom.\"There are those who attribute Sifra diTzni'uta to the patriarch Yaakov; however, Rabbi Eliezer Tzvi of Kamarno in his book Zohar Chai wrote, \"Sifra diTzni'uta was composed by Rashbi... and he arranged [it] from baraitas that were transmitted to Tannaim from mount Sinai from the days of Moshe, similar to the way Rabeinu HaKadosh arranged the six orders of Mishnah from that which was repeated from before.\"\nIdra Rabba/The Great Assembly (\u05d0\u05d3\u05e8\u05d0 \u05e8\u05d1\u05d0) \nThe Idra Rabba is found in the Zohar Vol. 3, parashat Nasso (pp. 127b-145a), and its name means, \"The Great Assembly\". \"Idra\" is a sitting-place of sages, usually circular, and the word \"Rabba/Great\" differentiates this section from the section Idra Zuta, which was an assembly of fewer sages that occurred later, as mentioned below.\nIdra Rabba contains the discussion of nine of Rashbi's friends, who gathered together to discuss great and deep secrets of Kabbalah. The nine are: Rabbi Elazar his son, Rabbi Abba, Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Yossi bar Yaakov, Rabbi Yitzchak, Rabbi Chezkiyah bar Rav, Rabbi Chiyya, Rabbi Yossi and Rabbi Yisa. After the opening of the discussion by Rashbi, the sages rise, one after the other, and lecture on the secret of Divinity, while Rashbi adds to and responds to their words. The lectures in this section mainly explain the words of the Sifra diTzni'uta, in a similar manner as the Gemara explains the Mishnah.As described in the Idra Rabba, before the Idra disjourned, three of the students died: Rabbi Yossi bar Yaakov, Rabbi Chezkiyah bar Rav, and Rabbi Yisa. As it is told, these students filled up with Godly light and therefore journeyed to the eternal world after their deaths. The remaining students saw their friends being carried away by angels. Rabbi Shimon said some words and they were calmed. He shouted out, \"Perhaps, God forbid, a decree has been passed upon us to be punished, for through us has been revealed that which has not been revealed since the time Moshe stood on Mount Sinai!\" At that instant a heavenly voice emerged and said, \"Fortunate are you Rabbi Shimon! and fortunate is your portion and the portion of the friends who remain alive with you! For it has been revealed to you that which has not been revealed to all the upper hosts.\"Idra Zuta/The Smaller Assembly (\u05d0\u05d3\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d6\u05d5\u05d8\u05d0) \nThe Idra Zuta is found in the Zohar Vol. 3, parashat Haazinu (p. 287b to 296b), and is called \"Idra Zuta\", which means, \"The Smaller Assembly\", distinguishing it from the aforementioned Greater Assembly, the Idra Rabba. In the Idra Zuta, Rashbi's colleagues convene again, this time seven in number, after the three mentioned above died. In the Idra Zuta the Chevraya Kadisha are privileged to hear teachings from Rashbi that conclude the words that were explained in the Idra Rabba.\nRa'aya Meheimna/The Faithful Shepherd (\u05e8\u05e2\u05d9\u05d0 \u05de\u05d4\u05d9\u05de\u05e0\u05d0) \nThe book Ra'aya Meheimna, the title of which means \"The Faithful Shepherd\", and which is by far the largest \"book\" included in the book of the Zohar, is what Moshe, the \"Faithful Shepherd\", teaches and reveals to Rashbi and his friends, who include Tannaim and Amoraim. In this assembly of Holy Friends, which took place in the Beit Midrash of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, secrets of and revelations on mitzvot of the Torah are explained and clarified \u2014 roots and deep meanings of mitzvot. Since it deals with mitzvot, from Ra'aya Meheimna it is possible to learn very much about the ways of the halakhic rulings of the Rabbis.Ra'aya Meheimna is distributed over several parashiyot throughout the Zohar. Part of it is known and even printed on separate pages, and part of it is weaved into the body of the Zohar. Ra'aya Meiheimna is found in Vols. 2 and 3 of the Zohar, but is not found explicitly in Vol. 1. Several great rabbis and sages have tried to find the Ra'aya Meheimna, which originally is a vast book on all the 613 mitzvot, and arrange it according to the order of positive commandments and negative commandments, and even print it as a book on its own.In the lessons at the end of the Zohar, Ra'aya Meheimna is sometimes referred to as \"Chibra Kadma'ah\" \u2014 \"the preceding book\".\nRegarding the importance of Ra'aya Meheimna, Rabbi Moshe Cordovero said, \"Know that this book, which is called Ra'aya Meheimna, which Rashbi made with the tzadikim who are in Gan Eden, was a repair of the Shekhinah, and an aid and support for it in the exile, for there is no aid or support for the Shekhinah besides the secrets of the Torah... And everything that he says here of the secrets and the concepts\u2014it is all with the intention of unifying the Shekhinah and aiding it during the exile.Midrash haNe'elam/The Hidden Midrash (\u05de\u05d3\u05e8\u05e9 \u05d4\u05e0\u05e2\u05dc\u05dd)\nMidrash haNe'elam is located within the body of the Zohar (parashat Vayera, Chayei Sarah, Toldot) and the Zohar Chadash (pp. 2b-30b; 46b-47b (in the Zohar Chadash edition by Rav Reuven Margoliot), and in parashat Balak, Ki Teitze, and the entire Zohar Chadash on Shir haShirim, Ruth, and Eikah.)\nAccording to Ramaz, it is fit to be called Midrash haNe'elam because \"its topic is mostly the neshamah (an upper level of soul), the source of which is in Beri'ah, which is the place of the upper Gan Eden; and it is written in the Pardes that drash is in Beri'ah... and the revealed midrash is the secret of externality, and Midrash haNe'elam is the secret of internality, which is the neshamah. And this derush is founded on the neshamah; its name befits it \u2013 Midrash haNe'elam.The language of Midrash haNe'elam is sometimes Hebrew, sometimes Aramaic, and sometimes both mixed. Unlike the body of the Zohar, its drashas are short and not long. Also, the topics it discusses \u2014 the work of Creation, the nature the soul, the days of Mashiach, and Olam Haba \u2014 are not of the type found in the Zohar, which are the nature of God, the emanation of worlds, the \"forces\" of evil, and more.\nIdra deVei Mashkana, Heikhalot, Raza deRazin, Saba deMishpatim, Tosefta, and Sitrei Torah\nIn the Zohar there are more sections that are of different nature with regard to their contents and importance, as follows: Idra deVei Mashkana (\"Assembly of the House of the Tabernacle\") deals mainly with the secrets of prayer, and is found in the Zohar Vol. 2, parashat Mishpatim (pp. 122b-123b). Heikhalot (\"Palaces\") deals in describing the palaces of Gan Eden, and Gehinom, and contains many matters related to prayer. It is found in the Zohar Vol. 1, parashat Bereishit (pp 38a-45b); Vol. 2 parashat Pekudei (pp. 244b-262b, heikhalot of holiness; pp. 262b-268b, heikhalot of impurity). Raza deRazin (\"Secret of Secrets\") deals with revealing the essence of a man via the features of his face and hands. It is found in the Zohar Vol. 2,parashat Yitro (pp. 70a-75a). Saba deMishpatim (\"The Elder on Statutes\") is the commentary of Rav Yiba Saba regarding transmigration of souls, and punishments of the body in the grave. It is found in the Zohar Vol. 2,parashat Mishpatim (pp. 94a-114a). Tosefta are paragraphs containing the beginnings of chapters on the wisdom of the Kabbalah of the Zohar, and it is dispersed in all three volumes of the Zohar. Sitrei Torah are drashas of verses from the Torah regarding matters of the soul and the secret of Divinity, and they are dispersed in the Zohar Vol. 1.For more books and sources mentioned in the Zohar, see also below.\n\n\n=== Zohar Chadash/The New Zohar (\u05d6\u05d5\u05d4\u05e8 \u05d7\u05d3\u05e9) ===\nAfter the book of the Zohar had been printed (in Mantua and in Cremona, in the Jewish years 5318-5320 or 1558-1560? CE), many more manuscripts were found that included paragraphs pertaining to the Zohar in their content and had not been included in printed editions. The manuscripts pertained also to all parts of the Zohar; some were similar to Zohar on the Torah, some were similar to the inner parts of the Zohar (Midrash haNe'elam, Sitrei Otiyot and more), and some pertained to Tikunei haZohar. Some thirty years after the first edition of the Zohar was printed, the manuscripts were gathered and arranged according to the parashas of the Torah and the megillot (apparently the arrangement was done by the Kabbalist, Rabbi Avraham haLevi of Tsfat), and were printed first in Salonika in Jewish year 5357 (1587? CE), and then in Krak\u00f3w (5363), and afterwards many times in various editions.There is Zohar Chadash on the Torah for many parashas across the chumash, namely, on chumash Bereishit: Bereishit, Noach, Lekh Lekha, Vayeira, Vayeishev; on chumash Shemot: Beshalach, Yitro, Terumah, Ki Tissa; on chumash Vayikra: Tzav, Acharei, Behar; on chumash Bamidbar: Chukat, Balak, Matot; on chumash Devarim: Va'etchanan, Ki Tetze, Ki Tavo.Within the paragraphs of Zohar Chadash are inserted Sitrei Otiyot (\"Secrets of the Letters\") and Midrash haNe'elam, on separate pages. Afterwards follows the midrashim \u2013 Midrash haNe'elam on the megillot: Shir haShirim, Ruth, and Eikhah. And at the end are printed Tikunim (Tikunei Zohar Chadash, \u05ea\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d6\u05d5\u05d4\u05e8 \u05d7\u05d3\u05e9), like the Tikunei haZohar.\n\n\n=== Tikunei haZohar/Rectifications of the Zohar (\u05ea\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4\u05d6\u05d5\u05d4\u05e8) ===\n\nTikunei haZohar, which was printed as a separate book, includes seventy commentaries called \"Tikunim\" (lit. Repairs) and an additional eleven Tikkunim. In some editions, Tikunim are printed that were already printed in the Zohar Chadash, which in their content and style also pertain to Tikunei haZohar.Each of the seventy Tikunim of Tikunei haZohar begins by explaining the word \"Bereishit\" (\u05d1\u05e8\u05d0\u05e9\u05d9\u05ea), and continues by explaining other verses, mainly in parashat Bereishit, and also from the rest of Tanakh. And all this is in the way of Sod, in commentaries that reveal the hidden and mystical aspects of the Torah.\nTikunei haZohar and Ra'aya Meheimna are similar in style, language, and concepts, and are different from the rest of the Zohar. For example, the idea of the Four Worlds is found in Tikunei haZohar and Ra'aya Meheimna but not elsewhere, as is true of the very use of the term \"Kabbalah\". In terminology, what is called Kabbalah in \u2192Tikunei haZohar and Ra'aya Meheimna is simply called razin (clues or hints) in the rest of the Zohar.\nIn Tikunei haZohar there are many references to \"chibura kadma'ah\" (meaning \"the earlier book\"). This refers to the main body of the Zohar.\n\n\n=== Parts of the Zohar: summary of Rabbinic view ===\nThe traditional Rabbinic view is that most of the Zohar and the parts included in it (i.e. those parts mentioned above) were written and compiled by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, but some parts preceded Rashbi and he used them (such as Sifra deTzni'uta; see above), and some parts were written or arranged in generations after Rashbi's passing (for example, Tannaim after Rashbi's time are occasionally mentioned). However, aside from the parts of the Zohar mentioned above, in the Zohar are mentioned tens of earlier sources that Rashbi and his Chevraya Kadisha had, and they were apparently the foundation of the Kabbalistic tradition of the Zohar. These include Sefer Raziel, Sifra de'Agad'ta, Sifra de'Adam haRishon, Sifra de'Ashmedai, Sifra Chakhmeta 'Ila'ah diVnei Kedem, Sifra deChinukh, Sifra diShlomoh Malka, Sifra Kadma'i, Tzerufei de'Atvun de'Itmasru le'Adam beGan 'Eden, and more. In the Jewish view this indicates more, that the teaching of the Sod in the book of the Zohar was not invented in the Tannaic period, but rather it is a tradition from ancient times that Rashbi and his Chevraya Kadisha used and upon which they built and founded their Kabbalah, and also that its roots are in the Torah that was given by Hashem to Moshe on Sinai.\n\n\n=== Viewpoint and exegesis: Rabbinic view ===\nAccording to the Zohar, the moral perfection of man influences the ideal world of the Sefirot; for although the Sefirot accept everything from the Ein Sof (Heb. \u05d0\u05d9\u05df \u05e1\u05d5\u05e3, infinity), the Tree of Life itself is dependent upon man: he alone can bring about the divine effusion.\nThis concept is somewhat akin to the concept of Tikkun olam. The dew that vivifies the universe flows from the just.\nBy the practice of virtue and by moral perfection, man may increase the outpouring of heavenly grace.\nEven physical life is subservient to virtue.\nThis, says the Zohar, is indicated in the words \"for the Lord God had not caused it to rain\" (Gen. 2:5), which means that there had not yet been beneficent action in heaven, because man had not yet been created to pray for it.The Zohar assumes four kinds of Biblical text exegesis, from the literal to the more mystical:\n\nThe simple, literal meaning of the text: Peshat\nThe allusion or hinted/allegorical meaning: Remez\nThe rabbinic comparison through sermon or illustration and metaphor: Derash\nThe secret/mysterious/hidden meaning: SodThe initial letters of these words (P, R, D, S) form together the word PaRDeS (\"paradise/orchard\"), which became the designation for the Zohar's view of a fourfold meaning of the text, of which the mystical sense is considered the highest part.\n\n\n=== Academic views ===\nIn Eros and Kabbalah, Moshe Idel (Professor of Jewish Mysticism, Hebrew University in Jerusalem) argues that the fundamental distinction between the rational-philosophic strain of Judaism and mystical Judaism, as exemplified by the Zohar, is the mystical belief that the Godhead is complex, rather than simple, and that divinity is dynamic and incorporates sex, having both male and female dimensions. These polarities must be conjoined (have yihud, \"union\") to maintain the harmony of the cosmos. Idel characterizes this metaphysical point of view as \"ditheism\", holding that there are two aspects to God, and the process of union as \"theoeroticism\". This ditheism, the dynamics it entails, and its reverberations within creation is arguably the central interest of the Zohar, making up a huge proportion of its discourse (pp. 5\u201356).\nMention should also be made of the work of Elliot Wolfson (Professor of Jewish Mysticism, New York University), who has almost single-handedly challenged the conventional view, which is affirmed by Idel as well. Wolfson likewise recognizes the importance of heteroerotic symbolism in the kabbalistic understanding of the divine nature. The oneness of God is perceived in androgynous terms as the pairing of male and female, the former characterized as the capacity to overflow and the latter as the potential to receive. Where Wolfson breaks with Idel and other scholars of the kabbalah is in his insistence that the consequence of that heteroerotic union is the restoration of the female to the male. Just as, in the case of the original Adam, the woman was constructed from man, and their carnal cleaving together was portrayed as becoming one flesh, so the ideal for kabbalists is the reconstitution of what Wolfson calls the male androgyne. Much closer in spirit to some ancient Gnostic dicta, Wolfson understands the eschatological ideal in traditional Kabbalah to have been the female becoming male (see his Circle in the Square and Language, Eros, Being).\n\n\n== Commentaries ==\nThe first known commentary on the book of Zohar,\n\"Ketem Paz\", was written by Rabbi Shimon Lavi of Libya.\nAnother important and influential commentary on Zohar,\n22-volume \"Or Yakar\", was written by Rabbi Moshe Cordovero of the Tzfat (i.e. Safed) kabbalistic school in the 16th century.\nThe Vilna Gaon authored a commentary on the Zohar.\nRabbi Tzvi Hirsch of Zidichov wrote a commentary on the Zohar entitled Ateres Tzvi.\nA major commentary on the Zohar is the Sulam written by Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag.\nA full translation of the Zohar into Hebrew was made by the late Rabbi Daniel Frish of Jerusalem under the title Masok MiDvash.\n\n\n== Influence ==\n\n\n=== Judaism ===\nOn the one hand, the Zohar was lauded by many rabbis because it opposed religious formalism, stimulated one's imagination and emotions, and for many people helped reinvigorate the experience of prayer. In many places prayer had become a mere external religious exercise, while prayer was supposed to be a means of transcending earthly affairs and placing oneself in union with God.According to the Jewish Encyclopedia, \"On the other hand, the Zohar was censured by many rabbis because it propagated many superstitious beliefs, and produced a host of mystical dreamers, whose overexcited imaginations peopled the world with spirits, demons, and all kinds of good and bad influences.\" Many classical rabbis, especially Maimonides, viewed all such beliefs as a violation of Judaic principles of faith.\nIts mystic mode of explaining some commandments was applied by its commentators to all religious observances, and produced a strong tendency to substitute mystic Judaism in the place of traditional rabbinic Judaism. For example, Shabbat, the Jewish Sabbath, began to be looked upon as the embodiment of God in temporal life, and every ceremony performed on that day was considered to have an influence upon the superior world.Elements of the Zohar crept into the liturgy of the 16th and 17th centuries, and the religious poets not only used the allegorism and symbolism of the Zohar in their compositions, but even adopted its style, e.g. the use of erotic terminology to illustrate the relations between man and God. Thus, in the language of some Jewish poets, the beloved one's curls indicate the mysteries of the Deity; sensuous pleasures, and especially intoxication, typify the highest degree of divine love as ecstatic contemplation; while the wine-room represents merely the state through which the human qualities merge or are exalted into those of God.In the 17th century, it was proposed that only Jewish men who were at least 40 years old could study Kabbalah, and by extension read the Zohar, because it was believed to be too powerful for those less emotionally mature and experienced. \n\n\n=== Christian mysticism ===\nAccording to the Jewish Encyclopedia, \"The enthusiasm felt for the Zohar was shared by many Christian scholars, such as Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Johann Reuchlin, Aegidius of Viterbo, etc., all of whom believed that the book contained proofs of the truth of Christianity. They were led to this belief by the analogies existing between some of the teachings of the Zohar and certain Christian dogmas, such as the fall and redemption of man, and the dogma of the Trinity, which seems to be expressed in the Zohar in the following terms:\n\n'The Ancient of Days has three heads. He reveals himself in three archetypes, all three forming but one. He is thus symbolized by the number Three. They are revealed in one another. [These are:] first, secret, hidden 'Wisdom'; above that the Holy Ancient One; and above Him the Unknowable One. None knows what He contains; He is above all conception. He is therefore called for man 'Non-Existing' [Ayin]'\" (Zohar, iii. 288b).\n\nAccording to the Jewish Encyclopedia, \"This and other similar doctrines found in the Zohar are now known to be much older than Christianity, but the Christian scholars who were led by the similarity of these teachings to certain Christian dogmas deemed it their duty to propagate the Zohar.\"However, fundamental to the Zohar are descriptions of the absolute Unity and uniqueness of God, in the Jewish understanding of it, rather than a trinity or other plurality. One of the most common phrases in the Zohar is \"raza d'yichuda \"the secret of his Unity\", which describes the Oneness of God as completely indivisible, even in spiritual terms. A central passage, Patach Eliyahu (introduction to Tikunei Zohar 17a), for example, says:\n\nElijah opened and said: \"Master of the worlds! You are One, but not in number. You are He Who is Highest of the High, Most Hidden of the Hidden; no thought can grasp You at all...And there is no image or likeness of You, inside or out...And aside from You, there is no unity on High or Below. And You are acknowledged as the Cause of everything and the Master of everything...And You are the completion of them all. And as soon as You remove Yourself from them, all the Names remain like a body without a soul...All is to show how You conduct the world, but not that You have a known righteousness that is just, nor a known judgement that is merciful, nor any of these attributes at all...Blessed is God forever, amen and amen!\n\nThe meaning of the three heads of Keter, according to the kabbalists, has extremely different connotations from ascribing validity to any compound or plurality in God, even if the compound is viewed as unified. In Kabbalah, while God is an absolutely simple (non-compound), infinite Unity beyond grasp, as described in Jewish philosophy by Maimonides, through His Kabbalistic manifestations such as the Sephirot and the Shekhinah (Divine Presence), we relate to the living dynamic Divinity that emanates, enclothes, is revealed in, and incorporates, the multifarious spiritual and physical plurality of Creation within the Infinite Unity. Creation is plural, while God is Unity. Kabbalistic theology unites the two in the paradox of human versus Divine perspectives. The spiritual role of Judaism is to reach the level of perceiving the truth of the paradox, that all is One, spiritual and physical Creation being nullified into absolute Divine Monotheism. Ascribing any independent validity to the plural perspective is idolatry. Nonetheless, through the personalised aspects of God, revealing the concealed mystery from within the Divine Unity, man can perceive and relate to God, who otherwise would be unbridgably far, as the supernal Divine emanations are mirrored in the mystical Divine nature of man's soul.\nThe relationship between God's absolute Unity and Divine manifestations may be compared to a man in a room - there is the man himself, and his presence and relationship to others in the room. In Hebrew, this is known as the Shekhinah. It is also the concept of God's Name - it is His relationship and presence in the world towards us. The Wisdom (literally written as Field of Apples) in kabbalistic terms refers to the Shekhinah, the Divine Presence. The Unknowable One (literally written as the Miniature Presence) refers to events on earth when events can be understood as natural happenings instead of God's act, although it is actually the act of God. This is known as perceiving the Shekhinah through a blurry, cloudy lens. This means to say, although we see God's Presence (not God Himself) through natural occurrences, it is only through a blurry lens; as opposed to miracles, in which we clearly see and recognize God's presence in the world. The Holy Ancient One refers to God Himself, Who is imperceivable. (see Minchas Yaakov and anonymous commentary in the Siddur Beis Yaakov on the Sabbath hymn of Askinu Seudasa, composed by the Arizal based on this lofty concept of the Zohar).\nWithin the descending Four Worlds of Creation, each successive realm perceives Divinity less and apparent independence more. The highest realm Atziluth-Emanation, termed the \"Realm of Unity\", is distinguished from the lower three realms, termed the \"Realm of Separation\", by still having no self-awareness; absolute Divine Unity is revealed and Creation is nullified in its source. The lower three Worlds feel progressive degrees of independence from God. Where lower Creation can mistake the different Divine emanations as plural, Atziluth feels their non-existent unity in God. Within the constricted appearance of Creation, God is revealed through various and any plural numbers. God uses each number to represent a different supernal aspect of reality that He creates, to reflect their comprehensive inclusion in His absolute Oneness: 10 Sephirot, 12 Partzufim, 2 forms of Light, 2 Partzufim and 3 Heads in Keter, 4 letters of the Tetragrammaton, 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, 13 Attributes of Mercy, etc. All such forms when traced back to their source in God's infinite light, return to their state of absolute Oneness. This is the consciousness of Atziluth. In Kabbalah, this perception is considered subconsciously innate to the souls of Israel, rooted in Atzilut. The souls of the Nations are elevated to this perception through adherence to the 7 Laws of Noah, that bring them to absolute Divine Unity and away from any false plural perspectives.\nThere is an alternative notion of three in the Zohar that is One, \"Israel, the Torah and the Holy One Blessed Be He are One.\" From the perspective of God, before constriction in Creation, these three are revealed in their source as a simple (non-compound) absolute Unity, as is all potential Creation from God's perspective. In Kabbalah, especially in Hasidism, the communal divinity of Israel is revealed Below in the righteous Tzadik Jewish leader of each generation who is a collective soul of the people. In the view of Kabbalah, however, no Jew would worship the supernal community souls of the Jewish people, or the Rabbinic leader of the generation, nor the totality of Creation's unity in God itself, as Judaism innately perceives the absolute Monotheism of God. In a Kabbalistic phrase, one prays \"to Him, not to His attributes\". As Kabbalah sees the Torah as the Divine blueprint of Creation, so any entity or idea in Creation receives its existence through an ultimate lifeforce in Torah interpretation. However, in the descent of Creation, the Tzimtzum constrictions and impure Qliphoth side of false independence from God result in distortion of the original vitality source and idea. Accordingly, in the Kabbalistic view, the non-Jewish belief in the Trinity, as well as the beliefs of all religions, have parallel, supernal notions within Kabbalah from which they ultimately exist in the process of Creation. However, the impure distortion results from human ascription of false validity and worship to Divine manifestations, rather than realising their nullification to God's Unity alone.In normative Christian theology, as well as the declaration of the First Council of Nicaea, God is declared to be \"one\". Declarations such as \"God is three\" or \"God is two\" are condemned in later counsels as entirely heretical and idolatrous. The beginning of the essential declaration of belief for Christians, the Nicene Creed (somewhat equivalent to Maimonides' 13 principles of Faith), starts with the Shema influenced declaration that \"We Believe in One God...\" Like Judaism, Christianity asserts the absolute monotheism of God.Unlike the Zohar, Christianity interprets the coming of the Messiah as the arrival of the true immanence of God. Like the Zohar the Messiah is believed to be the bringer of Divine Light: \"The Light (the Messiah) shineth in the Darkness and the Darkness has never put it out\", yet the Light, although being God, is separable within God since no one has seen God in flesh: \"for no man has seen God...\" (John 1). It is through the belief that Jesus Christ is the Messiah, since God had vindicated him by raising him from the dead, that Christians believe that Jesus is paradoxically and substantially God, despite God's simple undivided unity. The belief that Jesus Christ is \"God from God, Light from Light\" is assigned as a mystery and weakness of the human mind-affecting and effecting in our comprehension of him. The mystery of the Trinity and our mystical union with the Ancient of Days will only be made, like in the Zohar, in the new Garden of Eden, which is made holy by the Light of God where people's love for God is unending.\n\n\n== Zohar study (Jewish view) ==\nWho Should Study Tikunei haZohar\n\nDespite the preeminence of Tikunei haZohar and despite the topmost priority of Torah study in Judaism, much of the Zohar has been relatively obscure and unread in the Jewish world in recent times, particularly outside of Israel and outside of Chasidic groups. Although some rabbis since the Shabbetai Tzvi debacle still maintain that one should be married and forty years old in order to study Kabbalah, since the time of Baal Shem Tov there has been relaxation of such stringency, and many maintain that it is sufficient to be married and knowledgeable in halakhah and hence permitted to study Kabbalah and by inclusion, Tikunei haZohar; and some rabbis will advise learning Kabbalah without restrictions of marriage or age. In any case the aim of such caution is to not become caught up in Kabbalah to the extent of departing from reality or halakhah.\nRabbinic Accolades; the Importance of Studying Tikunei haZohar\nMany eminent rabbis and sages have echoed the Zohar's own urgings for Jews to study it, and have and urged people in the strongest of terms to be involved with it. To quote from the Zohar and from some of those rabbis:\n\n \"Vehamaskilim yavinu/But they that are wise will understand\" (Dan. 12:10) \u2013 from the side of Binah (understanding), which is the Tree of Life. Therefore it is said, \"Vehamaskilim yaz'hiru kezohar haraki'a\"/And they that are wise will shine like the radiance of the sky\" (Dan. 12:3) \u2013 by means of this book of yours, which is the book of the Zohar, from the radiance (Zohar) of Ima Ila'ah (the \"Higher Mother\", the higher of the two primary partzufim that develop from Binah) [which is] teshuvah; with those [who study this work], trial is not needed. And because Yisrael will in the future taste from the Tree of Life, which is this book of the Zohar, they will go out, with it, from Exile, in a merciful manner, and with them will be fulfilled, \"Hashem badad yanchenu, ve'ein 'imo El nechar/Hashem alone will lead them, and there is no strange god with Him\" (Deut. 32:12).\n\nWoe to the [people of the] world who hide the heart and cover the eyes, not gazing into the secrets of the Torah!\nRabbi Nachman of Breslov said the following praise of the Zohar's effect in motivating mitzvah performance, which is the main focus in Judaism:\n\nIt is [already] known that learning the Zohar is very, very mesugal [capable of bringing good effects]. Now know, that by learning the Zohar, desire is generated for all types of study of the holy Torah; and the holy wording of the Zohar greatly arouses [a person] towards service of Hashem Yitbarakh. Namely, the praise with which it praises and glorifies a person who serves Hashem, that is, the common expression of the Zohar in saying, \"Zaka'ah/Fortunate!\" etc. regarding any mitzvah; and vice-versa, the cry that it shouts out, \"Vai!\" etc., \"Vai leh, Vai lenishmateh/Woe to him! Woe to his soul!\" regarding one who turns away from the service of Hashem \u2014 these expressions greatly arouse the man for the service of the Blessed One.\n\n\n== English translations ==\nZohar Pages in English, at ha-zohar.net, including the Introduction translated in English\nBerg, Michael: Zohar 23 Volume Set- The Kabbalah Centre International.

It is a group of books including commentary on the mystical aspects of the Torah (the five books of Moses) and scriptural interpretations as well as material on mysticism, mythical cosmogony, and mystical psychology. The Zohar contains discussions of the nature of God, the origin and structure of the universe, the nature of souls, redemption, the relationship of Ego to Darkness and \"true self\" to \"The Light of God\".

He was born in Viterbo and died in Rome.\n\n\n== Life ==\nHe was born to humble parents and his given name is not known; his father was Lorenzo Antonini, of Canepina, near Viterbo, and his mother, Maria del Testa. He entered the Order of St. Augustine in June 1488 at which time he was given the name Giles. After a course of studies at priories of the Order in Ameria, Padua, Istria, Florence and Rome, where he studied philosophy. He was later made a doctor of theology. In 1506 became Vicar General of his Order. Upon the death of the Prior General, and, under the patronage of Pope Julius II, he was confirmed by election as his successor at three successive General Chapters of the Order: in 1507, 1511 and 1515.\nAntonini was a noted preacher, presiding at several papal services at the order of Pope Alexander VI. He also traveled widely, due to his responsibilities as head of the Order. This allowed to be in touch with the leading intellectual figures of the period, with many of whom he formed working collaborations. One friend, Giovanni Pontano, dedicated a work to him, entitled \u00c6gidius.Antonini is famous in ecclesiastical history for the boldness and earnestness of the discourse which he delivered at the opening of the Fifth Lateran Council, held in 1512, at the Lateran Palace.Following this service to his Order, Antonini was elevated to the rank of cardinal by Pope Leo X in the consistory of 1 July 1517, and given the titular church of San Bartolomeo all'Isola, which he immediately had changed to the Church of San Matteo in Via Merulana. He resigned the office of Prior General in February 1519. Pope Leo confided to him several sees in succession, employed him as legate on important missions, notably to Charles of Spain, soon to be Emperor. In 1523 Pope Leo gave him the title of Latin Patriarch of Constantinople.Antonini's zeal for the genuine reformation of conditions in the Catholic Church prompted him to present Pope Adrian VI with a Promemoria. He was universally esteemed as a learned and virtuous member of the great pontifical senate and many deemed him destined to succeed Pope Clement VII.\nWhen the forces of Emperor Charles sacked the city in 1527, Antonini's extensive library was destroyed. He spent the next year living in exile in Padua. In 1530 he requested the transfer of his titular church to that of the Church of San Marcello al Corso.Antonini died in Rome and was buried in the Basilica of Sant'Agostino.\n\n\n== Christian cabalist ==\nAntonini knew Marsilio Ficino from a visit to Florence, and he was familiar with Pico della Mirandola's interpretations of the Kabbalah, which he was to surpass in the depth of his understanding; his interest in the Talmud led him into correspondence with Johannes Reuchlin.In Jewish history, Antonini is coupled with the grammarian Elias Levita, who honed his knowledge of Hebrew and Aramaic. When the turmoil of war drove Levita from Padua to Rome, he was welcomed at the palace of the bishop, where, with his family, he lived and was supported for more than ten years. It was there that Levita's career as the foremost tutor of Christian notables in Hebrew lore commenced. The first edition of Levita's Ba\u1e25ur (Rome, 1518) is dedicated to Aegidius. Aegidius introduced Levita to classical scholarship and the Greek language, thus enabling him to utilize Greek in his Hebrew lexicographic labors \u2014 a debt acknowledged by Levita, who, in 1521, dedicated his Concordance to the cardinal.\nAntonini's main motive was to penetrate the mysteries of the Cabala. \u00c6gidius belonged to the group of sixteenth century Christian cabalists, among whom Johann Reuchlin and Pico della Mirandola also were prominent, who believed that Jewish mysticism, and particularly the Zohar, contained incontrovertible testimony to the truth of the Christian religion. In the course of Reuchlin's conflict with the obscurantists (1507\u201321), in which the preservation of the Jewish books was at issue, the cardinal wrote (1516) to his friend: \"While we labor on thy behalf, we defend not thee, but the law; not the Talmud, but the Church.\"\nAntonini also engaged another Jewish scholar, Baruch di Benevento, to translate for him the Zohar (the mystic Book of Splendor). The scholar last named may also have been partly responsible for the numerous cabalistic translations and treatises which appeared under the name of \u00c6gidius. The cardinal was a collector of Hebrew manuscripts, of which many are still to be seen at the Munich Library, bearing both faint traces of his signature and brief Latin annotations.\nIn the Biblioteca Angelica at Rome an old Hebrew manuscript is extant, which was given to Antonini by Pope Leo X. The richly illuminated manuscript (Ms. Or 72), produced in the 14th century, contains Biblical texts in Hebrew, grammatical and rabbinic works. The British Museum contains a copy of Makiri and the Midrash on the minor Prophets, written for the cardinal at Tivoli, in the year 1514, by Johanan ben Jacob Sarkuse. The study of Jewish literature led the cardinal to a friendly interest in the Jews themselves, which he manifested both in his energetic encouragement of Reuchlin in the struggle referred to above and in a vain attempt which he made in the year 1531, in conjunction with the cardinal Geronimo de Ghinucci, to prevent the issue of the papal edict authorizing the introduction of the Inquisition against the Maranos.\n\n\n== Works ==\nAntonini was a profound student of the Scriptures and a good scholar in Greek as well as Hebrew. Giovanni Pontano dedicated to him one of his Dialoghi.\nThe writings commonly attributed to Antonini are numerous. Most of them are to be found in manuscript form in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale, Paris, but their authenticity is still to be established. Aside from minor works on the Hebrew language, the majority by far are of a cabalistic nature. There is scarcely a classic of Jewish medieval mysticism that he has not translated, annotated, or commented upon. Among these works may be mentioned the Zohar.\nOnly a few of Antonini's writings have been printed in the third volume of the Collectio Novissima of Mart\u00e8ne. When urged by Pope Clement VII to publish his works, he is said, by the Augustinian historian, Friar Tom\u00e1s de Herrera, O.E.S.A., to have replied that he feared to contradict famous and holy men by his exposition of Scripture. The Pope replied that human respect should not deter him; it was quite permissible to preach and write what was contrary to the opinions of others, provided one did not depart from the truth and from the common tradition of the Church.Antonini's major original work is an historical treatise: Historia viginti s\u00e6culorum per totidem psalmos conscripta. It deals in a philosophico-historical way with the history of the world before and after the birth of Christ, is valuable for the history of its own time, and offers a certain analogy with Bossuet's famous Discours sur l'histoire universelle.\nThe six books of Antonini's important correspondence (1497\u20131523) concerning the affairs of his Order, much of which is addressed to Friar Gabriel of Venice, his successor as Prior General, are preserved in Rome in the Biblioteca Angelica. Cardinal Joseph Hergenr\u00f6ther, a leading Church historian of the 19th century, praised particularly the circular letter in which Antonini made known (27 February 1519), his resignation of the office of Prior General of the Augustinian friars.Other of Antonini's known works are a commentary on the first book of the Sentences of Peter Lombard, three Eclogae Sacrae, a dictionary of Hebrew roots, a Libellus de ecclesiae incremento, a Liber dialogorum, and an Informatio pro sedis apostolicae auctoritate contra Lutheranam sectam.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Herbermann, Charles, ed.

By 1911, the date of this latter proposal, \"neither the [Jewish] Publication Society nor any body of respectable scholars would work with him,\" according to encyclopedist Cyrus Adler.\n\n\n== Religious views ==\nSinger held extremely liberal views which at times proved unpopular. He endorsed Jesus and the Christian New Testament and proposed a Hebrew translation. He founded the Amos Society to promote understanding among followers of monotheistic religions.His 1897 prospectus for the encyclopedia project called for harmony between religions; called the Sabbath and holidays \"heavy burdens, or, at best, mere ceremonies\" for most Jews; and made the radical suggestion that Jewish parents, if honest with their children, would tell them:\n\nOur religion ... does not accord with your ideas. We have neither the power nor the desire to impose it on you. Make your peace with your God and your conscience as best you can,\" and, that said, let us cease to erect new synagogues, let us close our seminaries of theology, and let us disintegrate, little by little, our ancient communal institutions.\nDue to the controversy of Singer's outlooks, his publisher, Funk & Wagnalls, agreed to the encyclopedia project only after divesting Singer of editorial control and appointing a board of prestigious Jewish scholars, including rabbis.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Singer, Isidore;  et al., eds.
