"Partzufim/Partsufim (Hebrew: \u05e4\u05e8\u05e6\u05d5\u05e4\u05d9\u05dd\u200e, singular partzuf, Hebrew: \u05e4\u05e8\u05e6\u05d5\u05e3\u200e), meaning Divine \"Personae/Visages/Faces/Forms/Configurations\", are particular reconfigured arrangements of the ten sephirot (Divine attributes/emanations of Kabbalah). Each partzuf is thus a configuration of disparate entities into a harmonious unit. The names of the partzufim are derived from the Zohar, the foundational text of Kabbalah. There, they  are synonymous terms for the sefirot. Their full doctrinal significance emerged in 16th century Lurianic Kabbalah with reference to the cosmic processes of Shevirah-\"Shattering\" and Tikun-\"Rectification.\"\nMedieval Kabbalah described the ten sefirot as divine channels that emanate from their source and descend in a linear progression. Moshe Cordovero systemised the different Medieval interpretations of the Zohar. Later, Isaac Luria recast Kabbalah into its second articulation. \"Lurianic Partzufim\" describe the dynamic relationships between personae, which interact with each other. The higher partzufim enclothe themselves within the lower ones, as a soul is enclothed in a body.\nAccording to the Lurianic system, the linear scheme of sefirot precipitates the \"shattering\" of Tohu- \"the World of Chaos.\" Their reformation as partzufim in the World of Atzilut, or Rectification, begins cosmic repair.\nAs a result of the collapse of the World of Chaos, sparks of holiness were lost, or exiled, in the three lower Worlds. Man, whose soul reflects the harmonised order of partzufim, rectifies the mundane world by redeeming the exiled sparks of holiness through Torah study and performance of mitzvot."
