"A golem ( GOH-l\u0259m; Hebrew: \u05d2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd\u200e) is an animated anthropomorphic being in Jewish folklore that is created entirely from inanimate matter (usually clay or mud). The word was used to mean an amorphous, unformed material in Psalms and medieval writing.The most famous golem narrative involves Judah Loew ben Bezalel, the late-16th-century rabbi of Prague. Many tales differ on how the golem was brought to life and controlled. According to Moment Magazine, \"the golem is a highly mutable metaphor with seemingly limitless symbolism. It can be a victim or villain, Jew or non-Jew, man or woman\u2014or sometimes both. Over the centuries it has been used to connote war, community, isolation, hope, and despair.\""
