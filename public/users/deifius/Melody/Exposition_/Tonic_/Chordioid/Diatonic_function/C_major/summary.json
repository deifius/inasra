"A major (or the key of A) is a major scale based on A, with the pitches A, B, C\u266f, D, E, F\u266f, and G\u266f. Its key signature has three sharps. Its relative minor is F-sharp minor and its parallel minor is A minor. The key of A major is the only key where a Neapolitan sixth chord on \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              2\n              ^\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\hat {2}}}\n   requires both a flat and a natural accidental.\nThe A major scale is:\n\nIn the treble, alto, and bass clefs, the G\u266f in the key signature is placed higher than C\u266f. However, in the tenor clef, it would require a ledger line and so G\u266f is placed lower than C\u266f."
