In its most literal sense, a melody is a combination of pitch and rhythm, while more figuratively, the term can include successions of other musical elements such as tonal color. It is the foreground to the background accompaniment.

Melodies may also be described by their melodic motion or the pitches or the intervals between pitches (predominantly conjunct or disjunct or with further restrictions), pitch range, tension and release, continuity and coherence, cadence, and shape.\n\n\n== Function and elements ==\nJohann Philipp Kirnberger argued:\n\nThe true goal of music\u2014its proper enterprise\u2014is melody. All the parts of harmony have as their ultimate purpose only beautiful melody. Therefore, the question of which is the more significant, melody or harmony, is futile. Beyond doubt, the means is subordinate to the end.\nThe Norwegian composer Marcus Paus has argued:\n\nMelody is to music what a scent is to the senses: it jogs our memory. It gives face to form, and identity and character to the process and proceedings. It is not only a musical subject, but a manifestation of the musically subjective. It carries and radiates personality with as much clarity and poignancy as harmony and rhythm combined. As such a powerful tool of communication, melody serves not only as protagonist in its own drama, but as messenger from the author to the audience.\nGiven the many and varied elements and styles of melody \"many extant explanations [of melody] confine us to specific stylistic models, and they are too exclusive.\" Paul Narveson claimed in 1984 that more than three-quarters of melodic topics had not been explored thoroughly.The melodies existing in most European music written before the 20th century, and popular music throughout the 20th century, featured \"fixed and easily discernible frequency patterns\", recurring \"events, often periodic, at all structural levels\" and \"recurrence of durations and patterns of durations\".Melodies in the 20th century \"utilized a greater variety of pitch resources than ha[d] been the custom in any other historical period of Western music.\" While the diatonic scale was still used, the chromatic scale became \"widely employed.\" Composers also allotted a structural role to \"the qualitative dimensions\" that previously had been \"almost exclusively reserved for pitch and rhythm\". Kliewer states, \"The essential elements of any melody are duration, pitch, and quality (timbre), texture, and loudness. Though the same melody may be recognizable when played with a wide variety of timbres and dynamics, the latter may still be an \"element of linear ordering.\"\n\n\n== Examples ==\n\nDifferent musical styles use melody in different ways. For example:\n\nJazz musicians use the term \"lead\" or \"head\" to refer to the main melody, which is used as a starting point for improvisation.\nRock music, and other forms of popular music and folk music tend to pick one or two melodies (verse and chorus, sometimes with a third, contrasting melody known as a bridge or middle eight) and stick with them; much variety may occur in the phrasing and lyrics.\nIndian classical music relies heavily on melody and rhythm, and not so much on harmony, as the music contains no chord changes.\nBalinese gamelan music often uses complicated variations and alterations of a single melody played simultaneously, called heterophony.\nIn western classical music, composers often introduce an initial melody, or theme, and then create variations. Classical music often has several melodic layers, called polyphony, such as those in a fugue, a type of counterpoint. Often, melodies are constructed from motifs or short melodic fragments, such as the opening of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Richard Wagner popularized the concept of a leitmotif: a motif or melody associated with a certain idea, person or place.\nWhile in both most popular music and classical music of the common practice period pitch and duration are of primary importance in melodies, the contemporary music of the 20th and 21st centuries pitch and duration have lessened in importance and quality has gained importance, often primary. Examples include musique concr\u00e8te, klangfarbenmelodie, Elliott Carter's Eight Etudes and a Fantasy (which contains a movement with only one note), the third movement of Ruth Crawford-Seeger's String Quartet 1931 (later re-orchestrated as Andante for string orchestra), which creates the melody from an unchanging set of pitches through \"dissonant dynamics\" alone, and Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti's Aventures, in which recurring phonetics create the linear form.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHocket\nParsons code, a simple notation used to identify a piece of music through melodic motion\u2014the motion of the pitch up and down.\nSequence (music)\nUnified field\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nApel, Willi.

For example, in both C major and C minor, the tonic is C.  However, relative keys (two different scales that share a key signature) have different tonics. For example, C major and A minor share a key signature that feature no sharps or flats, despite having different tonic pitches (C and A, respectively).\nThe term tonic may be reserved exclusively for use in tonal contexts while tonal center and/or pitch center may be used in post-tonal and atonal music: \"For purposes of non-tonal centric music, it might be a good idea to have the term 'tone center' refer to the more general class of which 'tonics' (or tone centers in tonal contexts) could be regarded as a subclass.\" Thus, a pitch center may function referentially or contextually in an atonal context, often acting as an axis or line of symmetry in an interval cycle. The term pitch centricity was coined by Arthur Berger in his \"Problems of Pitch Organization in Stravinsky\". According to Walter Piston, \"the idea of a unified classical tonality replaced by nonclassical (in this case nondominant) centricity in a composition is perfectly demonstrated by Debussy's Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune\" (Play opening ).The tonic includes four separate activities or roles as the principal goal tone, initiating event, generator of other tones, and the stable center neutralizing the tension between dominant and subdominant.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFinal (music)\nTonic chord\nDouble tonic\nSubtonic\nSupertonic\n\n\n== References ==", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Claude_debussy_faune.mid", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/F-sharp_Major_key_signature.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Pyramid_chord.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Scale_deg_1.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg"], "summary": "In music, the tonic is the first scale degree () of the diatonic scale (the first note of a scale) and the tonal center or final resolution tone that is commonly used in the final cadence in tonal (musical key-based) classical music, popular music, and traditional music.

It is typical of chordioids that many different resultant chords can be created from the same base depending on the note or combination of notes added.  The resultant chords on a single chordioid are somewhat related, because they can be progressed between using motion of just one voice.  Theorists \u2013 or practical music teachers \u2013 writing of chordioids usually go so far as to advise that students learn them in the practical manner of chords generally: in all transpositions, ranges, permutations, and voicings, for reading, writing, and playing.\nIt is the case, also, that \"legitimate chords\" can be used as chordioids to create resultant chords by the same process.  Perhaps this is whence the non-chord chordioids come.  The Italian augmented 6th chord (It+6) is one example, from which proceed the French augmented 6th chord (Fr+6) and German augmented 6th chord (Gr+6) by addition of one note.  Rawlins (2005) asserts that the notion derives from practice of such composers as Eric Satie, Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and Gabriel Faure, and was first used in jazz by Bill Evans.Two chordioids may potentially be combined, as well.  Typically, duplication of notes will result in a reduced number of unique notes in the resultant.\nChordioids as a technique is related to polychords insofar as polychords are the result of an additive process, but differs in that the basis of polychords is the addition of two known chords.  Chordioids is related also to upper structures as a technique insofar as upper structures represent groups of notes not commonly taken to be \"legitimate\" chords, but differs in that chordioids as a technique uses a priori structures held in common rather than a free selection of color tones appropriate for a lower integral chord.  Chordioids is related to slash chords as a technique insofar as known chords may be used as chordioids to create resultant scales, but differs in that chordioids used are not exclusively known chords.\n\n\n== Master chord ==\n\nNicolas Slonimsky named \"master chord\" that chordioid described in jazz chord theory as 7no5, e.g.: { C D F\u266f }.  The sonority of the chordioid itself is identical to that of the It+6, a subset of the Wholetone scale and so subject to some of the symmetries and homogeneity for which that scale is known, and anhemitonic allowing the possibility that the resultant scale be anhemitonic or at least ancohemitonic itself.\nThe chord buttons of the Accordion usually play master chords, allowing the bass buttons (or a second chord button) to supply the variable note (or notes) to complete the sonority.\nThe new name and concept, \"master chord\", thus does not imply either jazz derivation, completeness of the sonority as an independent chord, nor connection to other use as a chord of dominant function.  It does not speciously denote anything to be \"missing\", or posit that the listener should ever hear a note not actually present.  It rejects the tertian chordal basis as pertaining at all.

It is typical of chordioids that many different resultant chords can be created from the same base depending on the note or combination of notes added.  The resultant chords on a single chordioid are somewhat related, because they can be progressed between using motion of just one voice.  Theorists \u2013 or practical music teachers \u2013 writing of chordioids usually go so far as to advise that students learn them in the practical manner of chords generally: in all transpositions, ranges, permutations, and voicings, for reading, writing, and playing.\nIt is the case, also, that \"legitimate chords\" can be used as chordioids to create resultant chords by the same process.  Perhaps this is whence the non-chord chordioids come.  The Italian augmented 6th chord (It+6) is one example, from which proceed the French augmented 6th chord (Fr+6) and German augmented 6th chord (Gr+6) by addition of one note.  Rawlins (2005) asserts that the notion derives from practice of such composers as Eric Satie, Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, and Gabriel Faure, and was first used in jazz by Bill Evans.Two chordioids may potentially be combined, as well.  Typically, duplication of notes will result in a reduced number of unique notes in the resultant.\nChordioids as a technique is related to polychords insofar as polychords are the result of an additive process, but differs in that the basis of polychords is the addition of two known chords.  Chordioids is related also to upper structures as a technique insofar as upper structures represent groups of notes not commonly taken to be \"legitimate\" chords, but differs in that chordioids as a technique uses a priori structures held in common rather than a free selection of color tones appropriate for a lower integral chord.  Chordioids is related to slash chords as a technique insofar as known chords may be used as chordioids to create resultant scales, but differs in that chordioids used are not exclusively known chords."}, "Diatonic_function": {"links": ["All-interval twelve-tone row", "Tonality diamond", "Common chord ", "Seventh chord", "Otonality and Utonality", "Seven six chord", "Primary triad", "Quartal and quintal harmony", "Arpeggio", "Diminished triad", "Polytonality", "Chordioid", "Chromatic mediant", "Altered chord", "Slash chord", "Predominant chord", "Dominant seventh chord", "Scale degree", "Diatonic and chromatic", "Tone cluster", "Nondominant seventh chord", "Mu chord", "Jean-Philippe Rameau", "Barre chord", "Constant structure", "Farben chord", "Ninth chord", "Minor major seventh chord", "Chord-scale system", "Secondary supertonic", "Modulation ", "Petrushka chord", "Chord ", "Lydian chord", "Key ", "Tertian", "Upper structure", "Juilliard", "Simon Sechter", "Mediant", "Riemannian theory", "Psalms chord", "Neapolitan chord", "C major", "Arnold Schoenberg", "Northern lights chord", "Extended chord", "Pyramid chord", "Diminished seventh chord", "Viennese trichord", "Minor seventh chord", "Progressive tonality", "Tonal centre", "Block chord", "Triad ", "Augmented sixth chord", "Harmonic seventh chord", "ISBN ", "Minor chord", "Major and minor", "List of chords", "Power chord", "Elektra chord", "Diatonic function", "Degree ", "Major seventh chord", "Hugo Riemann", "Leading tone", "Supertonic", "Open chord", "Heinrich Schenker", "Diether de la Motte", "Leading-tone", "Secondary chord", "Tristan chord", "Dominant seventh sharp ninth chord", "Function ", "Parallel key", "Tonic ", "Eleventh chord", "Dominant ", "Dream chord", "Mixed-interval chord", "Ostinato", "Common practice period", "Approach chord", "Borrowed chord", "Schenkerian analysis", "Consonance and dissonance", "Voice leading", "Altered seventh chord", "Roman numeral analysis", "Synthetic chord", "Factor ", "Figured bass", "Sonata form", "Submediant", "Augmented seventh chord", "Secundal", "Subdominant", "Sixth chord", "Circle of fifths", "Subsidiary chord", "Secondary leading-tone", "Subtonic", "Just intonation", "Passing chord", "Added tone chord", "Neotonality", "Complexe sonore", "Major chord", "Tonicization", "Suspended chord", "Tonality", "Half-diminished seventh chord", "Terzschritt", "Secondary dominant", "Thirteenth", "Cadence", "Magic chord", "Diatonic scale", "Augmented triad", "Mystic chord", "Polychord", "Bridge chord", "Guitar chord", "So What chord", "Doi ", "Augmented major seventh chord", "Chord substitution", "Octatonic scale", "Diminished major seventh chord", "Dominant seventh flat five chord", "Parallel and counter parallel"], "content": "In music, function (also referred to as harmonic function) is a term used to denote the relationship of a chord or a scale degree to a tonal centre. Two main theories of tonal functions exist today:\n\nThe German theory created by Hugo Riemann in his Vereinfachte Harmonielehre of 1893, which soon became an international success (English and Russian translations in 1896, French translation in 1899), and which is the theory of functions properly speaking. Riemann described three abstract tonal \"functions\", tonic, dominant and subdominant, denoted by the letters T, D and S respectively, each of which could take on a more or less modified appearance in any chord of the scale. This theory, in several revised forms, remains much in use for the pedagogy of harmony and analysis in German-speaking countries and in North- and East-European countries.\nThe Viennese theory, characterized by the use of Roman numerals to denote the chords of the tonal scale, as developed by Simon Sechter, Arnold Schoenberg, Heinrich Schenker and others, practiced today in Western Europe and the United States. This theory in origin was not explicitly about tonal functions. It considers the relation of the chords to their tonic in the context of harmonic progressions, often following the cycle of fifths. That this actually describes what could be termed the \"function\" of the chords becomes quite evident in Schoenberg's Structural Functions of Harmony of 1954, a short treatise dealing mainly with harmonic progressions in the context of a general \"monotonality\".Both theories find part of their inspiration in the theories of Jean-Philippe Rameau, starting with his Trait\u00e9 d'harmonie of 1722. Even if the concept of harmonic function was not so named before 1893, it could be shown to exist, explicitly or implicitly, in many theories of harmony before that date. Early usages of the term in music (not necessarily in the sense implied here, or only vaguely so) include those by F\u00e9tis (Trait\u00e9 complet de la th\u00e9orie et de la pratique de l'harmonie, 1844), Durutte (Esth\u00e9tique musicale, 1855), Loquin (Notions \u00e9l\u00e9mentaires d'harmonie moderne, 1862), etc.The idea of function has been extended further and is sometimes used to translate Antique concepts, such as dynamis in Ancient Greece, or qualitas in medieval Latin.\n\n\n== Origins of the concept ==\nThe concept of harmonic function originates in theories about just intonation. It was realized that three perfect major triads, distant from each other by a perfect fifth, produced the seven degrees of the major scale in one of the possible forms of just intonation: for instance, the triads F\u2013A\u2013C, C\u2013E\u2013G and G\u2013B\u2013D (subdominant, tonic, and dominant respectively) produce the seven notes of the major scale. These three triads were soon considered the most important chords of the major tonality, with the tonic in the center, the dominant above and the subdominant under.\nThis symmetric construction may have been one of the reasons why the fourth degree of the scale, and the chord built on it, were named \"subdominant\", i.e. the \"dominant under [the tonic]\". It also is one of the origins of the dualist theories which described not only the scale in just intonation as a symmetric construction, but also the minor tonality as an inversion of the major one. Dualist theories are documented from the 16th century onwards.\n\n\n== German functional theory ==\nThe term 'functional harmony' derives from Hugo Riemann and, more particularly, from his Harmony Simplified. Riemann's direct inspiration was Moritz Hauptmann's dialectic description of tonality. Riemann described three abstract functions: the tonic, the dominant (its upper fifth), and the subdominant (its lower fifth). He also considered the minor scale to be the inversion of the major scale, so that the dominant was the fifth above the tonic in major, but below the tonic in minor; the subdominant, similarly, was the fifth below the tonic (or the fourth above) in major, and the reverse in minor.\nDespite the complexity of his theory, Riemann's ideas had huge impact, especially where German influence was strong. A good example in this regard are the textbooks by Hermann Grabner. More recent German theorists have abandoned the most complex aspect of Riemann's theory, the dualist conception of major and minor, and consider that the dominant is the fifth degree above the tonic, the subdominant the fourth degree, both in minor and in major.\n\nIn Diether de la Motte's version of the theory, the three tonal functions are denoted by the letters T, D and S, for Tonic, Dominant and Subdominant respectively; the letters are uppercase for functions in major (T, D, S), lowercase for functions in minor (t, d, s). Each of these functions can in principle be fulfilled by three chords: not only the main chord corresponding to the function, but also the chords a third lower or a third higher, as indicated by additional letters. An additional letter P or p indicates that the function is fulfilled by the relative (German Parallel) of its main triad: for instance Tp for the minor relative of the major tonic (e.g., A minor for C major), tP for the major relative of the minor tonic (e.g. E\u266d major for c minor), etc. The other triad a third apart from the main one may be denoted by an additional G or g for Gegenparallelklang or Gegenklang (\"counterrelative\"), for instance tG for the major counterrelative of the minor tonic (e.g. A\u266d major for C minor). \nThe relation between triads a third apart resides in the fact that they differ from each other by one note only, the two other notes being common notes. In addition, within the diatonic scale, triads a third apart necessarily are of opposite mode. In the simplified theory where the functions in major and minor are on the same degrees of the scale, the possible functions of triads on degrees I to VII of the scale could be summarized as in the table below (degrees II in minor and VII in major, diminished fifths in the diatonic scale, are considered as chords without fundamental). Chords on III and VI may exert the same function as those a third above or a third below, but one of these two is less frequent than the other, as indicated by parentheses in the table.\n\nIn each case, the mode of the chord is denoted by the final letter: for instance, Sp for II in major indicates that II is the minor relative (p) of the major subdominant (S). The major VIth degree in minor is the only one where both functions, sP (major relative of the minor subdominant) and tG (major counterparallel of the minor tonic), are equally plausible. Other signs (not discussed here) are used to denote altered chords, chords without fundamental, applied dominants, etc. Degree VII in harmonic sequence (e.g. I\u2013IV\u2013VII\u2013III\u2013VI\u2013II\u2013V\u2013I) may at times be denoted by its roman numeral; in major, the sequence would then be denoted by T\u2013S\u2013VII\u2013Dp\u2013Tp\u2013Sp\u2013D\u2013T.\nAs summarized by d'Indy (1903), who shared the conception of Riemann:\n\nThere is only one chord, a perfect chord; it alone is consonant because it alone generates a feeling of repose and balance;\nthis chord has two different forms, major and minor, depending whether the chord is composed of a minor third over a major third, or a major third over a minor;\nthis chord is able to take on three different tonal functions, tonic, dominant, or subdominant.\n\n\n== Viennese theory of the degrees ==\n\nThe Viennese theory on the other hand, the \"Theory of the degrees\" (Stufentheorie), represented by Simon Sechter, Heinrich Schenker and Arnold Schoenberg among others, considers that each degree has its own function and refers to the tonal center through the cycle of fifths; it stresses harmonic progressions above chord quality. In music theory as it is commonly taught in the US, there are six or seven different functions, depending on whether degree VII is considered to possess an independent function.\n\nStufentheorie stresses the individuality and independence of the seven harmonic degrees. Moreover, unlike Funktionstheorie, where the primary harmonic model is the I\u2013IV\u2013V\u2013I progression, Stufentheorie leans heavily on the cycle of descending fifths I\u2013IV\u2013VII\u2013III\u2013VI\u2013II\u2013V\u2013I\".\n\n\n== Comparison of the terminologies ==\nThe table below compares the English and German terminologies for the major scale. In English, the names of the scale degrees are also the names of their function, and they remain the same in major and in minor.\n\nNote that ii, iii, and vi are lowercase: this indicates that they are minor chords; vii\u00b0 indicates that this chord is a diminished triad.\n\nSome may at first be put off by the overt theorizing apparent in German harmony, wishing perhaps that a choice be made once and for all between Riemann's Funktionstheorie and the older Stufentheorie, or possibly believing that so-called linear theories have settled all earlier disputes. Yet this ongoing conflict between antithetical theories, with its attendant uncertainties and complexities, has special merits. In particular, whereas an English-speaking student may falsely believe that he or she is learning harmony \"as it really is,\" the German student encounters what are obviously theoretical constructs and must deal with them accordingly.\nReviewing usage of harmonic theory in American publications, William Caplin writes:\nMost North American textbooks identify individual harmonies in terms of the scale degrees of their roots. ... Many theorists understand, however, that the Roman numerals do not necessarily define seven fully distinct harmonies, and they instead propose a classification of harmonies into three main groups of harmonic functions: tonic, dominant, and pre-dominant.\nTonic harmonies include the I and VI chords in their various positions.\nDominant harmonies include the V and VII chords in their various positions. III can function as a dominant substitute in some contexts (as in the progression V\u2013III\u2013VI).\nPre-dominant harmonies include a wide variety of chords: IV, II, \u266dII, secondary (applied) dominants of the dominant (such as VII7/V), and the various \"augmented-sixth\" chords. ... The modern North American adaptation of the function theory retains Riemann\u2019s category of tonic and dominant functions but usually reconceptualizes his \"subdominant\" function into a more all-embracing pre-dominant function.\nCaplin further explains that there are two main types of pre-dominant harmonies, \"those built above the fourth degree of the scale () in the bass voice and those derived from the dominant of the dominant (V/V)\" (p. 10). The first type includes IV, II6 or \u266dII6, but also other positions of these, such as IV6 or \u266dII. The second type groups harmonies which feature the raised-fourth scale degree (\u266f) functioning as the leading tone of the dominant: VII7/V, V6V, or the three varieties of augmented sixth chords.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCommon practice period\nConstant structure\nDiatonic and chromatic\nNondominant seventh chord\nSecondary dominant\nSubsidiary chord\nRoman numeral analysis\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nImig, Renate (1970).

Mozart's Clarinet Concerto and Clarinet Quintet are both in A major, along with his 23rd piano concerto, and generally Mozart was more likely to use clarinets in A major than in any other key besides E-flat major. Moreover, the climax part of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto is also in A major.\nThe key of A major occurs frequently in chamber music and other music for strings, which favor sharp keys. Franz Schubert's Trout Quintet and Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's Piano Quintet No. 2 are both in A major. Johannes Brahms, C\u00e9sar Franck, and Gabriel Faur\u00e9 wrote violin sonatas in A major. In connection to Beethoven's Kreutzer Sonata, Peter Cropper said that A major \"is the fullest sounding key for the violin.\"According to Christian Friedrich Daniel Schubart, A major is a key suitable for \"declarations of innocent love, ... hope of seeing one's beloved again when parting; youthful cheerfulness and trust in God.\"For orchestral works in A major, the timpani are typically set to A and E a fifth apart, rather than a fourth apart as for most other keys. Hector Berlioz complained about the custom of his day in which timpani tuned to A and E a fifth apart were notated C and G a fourth apart, a custom which survived as late as the music of Franz Berwald.\n\n\n== Notable compositions in A major ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nMajor and minor\nChord (music)\nChord names and symbols (popular music)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to A major at Wikimedia Commons", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/A-major_f-sharp-minor.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Circle_of_fifths_deluxe_4.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg"], "summary": "A major (or the key of A) is a major scale based on A, with the pitches A, B, C\u266f, D, E, F\u266f, and G\u266f.

The use of the term generally implies that the material will be developed or varied.\n\nIn sonata form, the exposition is \"the first major section, incorporating at least one important modulation to the dominant or other secondary key and presenting the principal thematic material.\"\nIn a fugue, the exposition is \"the statement of the subject in imitation by the several voices; especially the first such statement, with which the fugue begins.\"\n\n\n== In Classical Sonatas ==\nThe term is most widely used as an analytical convenience to denote a portion of a movement identified as an example of classical tonal sonata form. The exposition typically establishes the music's tonic key, and then modulates to, and ends in, the dominant. If the exposition starts in a minor key, it typically modulates to the relative major key.  There are many exceptions, especially in the late Classical and Romantic era. For example, to the mediant (the first movement of Beethoven's \"Waldstein Sonata\"), the flat mediant (Ferdinand Ries' \"Pastorale\" Concerto No. 5), the dominant when in a minor key (Ries' Concerto No. 3), the minor dominant (Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 2, Brahms' Piano Concerto No. 2), the submediant (Schubert's \"Unfinished Symphony\"), the relative minor (Beethoven's \"Triple Concerto\", Ries' Concerto No. 6), or the parallel major (Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 1).  Saint-Saens' Piano Concerto No. 3 even modulates to the leading tone in its first movement exposition, with no orchestral accompaniment. On the other hand, other Classical and Romantic composers strictly adhered to the traditional scheme of modulating to the dominant in a major key or the relative major in a minor key, including Haydn, Mozart, Hummel, John Field, and Mendelssohn. The exposition may include identifiable musical themes (whether melodic, rhythmic or chordal in character), and may develop them, but it is usually the key relationships and the sense of \"arrival\" at the dominant that is used by analysts in identifying the exposition.\nThe exposition in classical symphonies is typically repeated, although there are many examples where the composer does not specify such a repeat, and it never is repeated in concertos. In the recapitulation, the material in the exposition is repeated or paraphrased either in the home key (as by Mozart), or the parallel major of the home key if it is minor (as by Beethoven), although as with the exposition, a different modulation may be used (such as to the mediant in Dvorak's \"New World Symphony\").\nIf the movement starts with an introductory section, this introduction is not usually analysed as being part of the movement's exposition.\nIn many works of the Classical period and some of the Romantic era, the exposition is often bracketed by repeat signs, indicating that it is to be played twice. This is something which is not always done in concert from the 20th Century onwards.\n\n\n== In Fugue ==\nA fugue usually has two main sections: the exposition and the body. In the exposition, each voice plays its own adaptation of the theme, in either a subject or an answer; they also provide countersubjects (counterpoints) to the following voices as they enter. The exposition usually ends on either a I or V chord, and is then followed by the body.\n\n\n== References ==", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Exposition_Haydn%27s_Sonata_in_G_Major.mid", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Exposition_Haydn%27s_Sonata_in_G_Major.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/FClef.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Loudspeaker.svg"], "summary": "In musical form and analysis, exposition is the initial presentation of the thematic material of a musical composition, movement, or section.
