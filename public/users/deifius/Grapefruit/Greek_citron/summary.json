"The Greek citron variety of Citrus medica (Greek: \u03ba\u03b9\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ac, Hebrew: \u05d0\u05ea\u05e8\u05d5\u05d2 \u05e7\u05d5\u05e8\u05e4\u05d5\u200e or \u05d9\u05b0\u05d5\u05b8\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9) was botanically classified by Adolf Engler as the \"variety etrog\". This is remarking on its major use for the Jewish ritual etrog during Sukkot.It was also called pitima, or the cedro col pigolo (\"citron with a pitom\"), because of its usually persisting pitom (carpel). The last does not only enhance its character, but also adds Halachic promotion.\n\n"
