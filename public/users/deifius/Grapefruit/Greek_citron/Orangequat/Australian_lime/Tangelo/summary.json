"The tangelo ( TAN-j\u0259-loh,  tan-JEL-oh; C. reticulata \u00d7 C. maxima or \u00d7 C. paradisi; sometimes referred to as honeybells), Citrus \u00d7 tangelo,  is a citrus fruit hybrid of a Citrus reticulata variety, such as a mandarin orange or tangerine, and a Citrus maxima variety, such as a pomelo or grapefruit.  The name is a portmanteau of 'tangerine' and 'pomelo'. \nTangelos are the size of an adult fist, have a tart and tangy taste, and are juicy at the expense of flesh. They generally have loose skin and are easier to peel than oranges, readily distinguished from them by a characteristic \"nipple\" at the stem. Tangelos can be used as a substitute for mandarin oranges or sweet oranges.\n\n"
