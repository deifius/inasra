The interior flesh is segmented and varies in color from pale yellow to dark pink.\nGrapefruit is a citrus hybrid originating in Barbados as an accidental cross between the sweet orange (C. sinensis) and the pomelo or shaddock (C. maxima), both of which were introduced from Asia in the 17th century. When found, it was called the forbidden fruit. In the past it was referred to as the pomelo, but that term is now the common name for Citrus maxima.In 2019, world production of grapefruits (combined with pomelos) was 9.3 million tonnes, of which 53% was in China. Other significant producers include Vietnam, United States and Mexico.\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nThe evergreen grapefruit trees usually grow to around 5\u20136 m (16\u201320 ft) tall, although they may reach 13\u201315 m (43\u201349 ft). The leaves are glossy, dark green, long (up to 15 cm (5.9 in)), and thin. It produces 5 cm (2 in) white four-petaled flowers. The fruit is yellow-orange skinned and generally, an oblate spheroid in shape; it ranges in diameter from 10 to 15 cm (3.9 to 5.9 in). The flesh is segmented and acidic, varying in color depending on the cultivars, which include white, pink, and red pulps of varying sweetness (generally, the redder varieties are the sweetest). The 1929 U.S. 'Ruby Red' (of the 'Redblush' variety) was the first grapefruit patent.\n\n\n== History ==\nGrapefruit originated as a natural hybrid. One ancestor of the grapefruit was the Jamaican sweet orange (Citrus sinensis), itself an ancient hybrid of Asian origin; the other was the Indonesian pomelo (C. maxima). Both C. sinensis and C. maxima were present in the West Indies by 1692. One story of the fruit's origin is that a certain \"Captain Shaddock\" brought pomelo seeds to Jamaica and bred the first fruit, which were then called shaddocks. This apparently referred to a captain who traded in the West Indies in the 17th century. The grapefruit then probably originated as a naturally occurring hybrid between the two plants some time after they had been introduced there.\n\nA hybrid fruit, called forbidden fruit, was first documented in 1750 (along with 14 other citrus fruits including the guiney orange) by a Welshman, Rev. Griffith Hughes, who described specimens from Barbados in The Natural History of Barbados. However, Hughes's forbidden fruit may have been a plant distinct from grapefruit although still closely related to it.In 1814, naturalist John Lunan published the term grapefruit to describe a similar Jamaican citrus plant. Lunan reported that the name was due to its similarity in taste to the grape (Vitis vinifera). An alternative explanation offered by Tussac (1824) is that this name may allude to clusters of the fruit on the tree, which often appear similar to bunches of grapes. After this, authors of the period used both terms forbidden fruit and grapefruit as synonyms.In 1830, the Jamaican version of the plant was given the botanical name Citrus paradisi by botanist James Macfadyen. Macfadyen identified two varieties \u2013 one called forbidden fruit, the other called Barbadoes Grape Fruit. Macfadyen distinguished between the two plants by fruit shape with the Barbadoes Grape Fruit being piriform while the forbidden fruit was \"maliformis.\" Macfadyen's and Hughes's description differ, so it is not clear that the two reports are describing the same plant. Kumamoto et al. (1987) suggest that Hughes's golden orange was actually a grapefruit while his forbidden fruit was a different plant that had since became extinct and frequently confused with grapefruits. Later, Kim (1990) found a different citrus called forbidden fruit or shaddette in Saint Lucia that is closely related to grapefruits and may be the plant described by Hughes and Macfadyen.The name grape-fruit was used more and more during the 19th century to refer to pomelos, to the consternation of some.\n\nThe grapefruit was brought to Florida by Count Odet Philippe in 1823, in what is now known as Safety Harbor. Further crosses have produced the tangelo (1905), the Minneola tangelo (1931), and the oroblanco (1984).Its true origins were not determined until the 1940s. This led to the official name being altered to Citrus \u00d7 paradisi, the \u00d7 identifying its hybrid origin.An early pioneer in the American citrus industry was Kimball Atwood, a wealthy entrepreneur who founded the Atwood Grapefruit Company in the late 19th century. The Atwood Grove became the largest grapefruit grove in the world, with a yearly output of 80,000 boxes of fruit. There, pink grapefruit was first discovered in 1906.\n\n\n== Varieties ==\nThe varieties of Texas and Florida grapefruit include: 'Duncan', 'Flame', 'Henderson', 'Hudson', 'Marsh', 'Oro Blanco', 'Pink', 'Pummelo HB', 'Ray', 'Rio Star', 'Ruby Red', 'Star Ruby', 'Thompson', 'Triumph', 'Walters', 'White Marsh'.\n\nThe 1929 'Ruby Red' (or 'Redblush') patent was associated with real commercial success, which came after the discovery of a red grapefruit growing on a pink variety. It was a limb sport of a 'Thompson' grapefruit selected by A.E. Henninger. The 'Thompson' was a limb sport from a 'Marsh' grapefruit selected in 1913.Using radiation to trigger mutations, new varieties were developed to retain the red tones that typically faded to pink. The 'Rio Red' variety is a 2007 Texas grapefruit with registered trademarks Rio Star and Ruby-Sweet, also sometimes promoted as Reddest and Texas Choice. The 'Rio Red' is a mutation-bred variety that was developed by treatment of bud sticks with thermal neutrons. Its improved attributes of mutant variety are fruit and juice color, deeper red, and wide adaptation.The 'Star Ruby' is the darkest of the red varieties. Developed from an irradiated 'Hudson' grapefruit ('Hudson' being a limb sport of 'Foster', itself a limb sport of the 'Walters'), it has found limited commercial success because it is more difficult to grow than other varieties.\n\n\n== Production ==\nIn 2019, world production of grapefruits (combined with pomelos) was 9.3 million tonnes, led by China with 53% of the world total. Secondary producers were Vietnam, the United States, and Mexico.\n\n\n== Parasites ==\nGrapefruits are one of the most common hosts for fruit flies such as A. suspensa, which lay their eggs in overripe or spoiled grapefruits. The larvae of these flies then consume the fruit to gain nutrients until they can proceed into the pupae stage. This parasitism has led to millions in economic costs for nations in Central America and southern North America.\n\n\n== Colors and flavors ==\n\nGrapefruit varieties are differentiated by the flesh color of fruit they produce. Common varieties are yellow and pink pulp colors. Flavors range from highly acidic and somewhat sour to sweet and tart, resulting from composition of sugars (mainly sucrose), organic acids (mainly citric acid), and monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes providing aromas.Grapefruit mercaptan, a sulfur-containing terpene, is one of the aroma compounds influencing taste and odor of grapefruit, compared with other citrus fruits.\n\n\n== Drug interactions ==\n\nGrapefruit and grapefruit juice have been found to interact with numerous drugs and in many cases, to result in adverse direct and/or side effects (if dosage is not carefully adjusted).This happens in two very different ways. In the first, the effect is from natural furanocoumarins such as bergamottin and 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin, which occur in both grapefruit flesh and peel. Furanocoumarins inhibit the CYP3A4 enzyme, including the P450 enzyme family responsible for metabolizing 90% of drugs. The action of the CYP3A4 enzyme itself is to metabolize many medications. If the drug's breakdown for removal is lessened, then the level of the drug in the blood may become too high or stay too long, leading to adverse effects. On the other hand, some drugs must be broken down to become active, and inhibiting CYP3A4 may lead to reduced drug effects.The other effect is that grapefruit can block the absorption of drugs in the intestine. If the drug is not absorbed, then not enough of it is in the blood to have a therapeutic effect. Each affected drug has either a specific increase of effect or decrease.One whole grapefruit, or a glass of 200 ml (7 US fl oz) of grapefruit juice may cause drug overdose toxicity. Typically, drugs that are incompatible with grapefruit are so labeled on the container or package insert. People taking drugs should ask their health-care provider or pharmacist questions about grapefruit and drug interactions.\n\n\n== Nutrition ==\nRaw grapefruit is 90% water, 8% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and negligible fat (table). In a 100 gram reference amount, raw grapefruit provides 33 kilocalories and is a rich source of vitamin C (40% of the Daily Value), with no other micronutrients in significant content.\nGrapefruit juice contains about half the citric acid of lime or lemon juice, and about 50% more citric acid than orange juice.\n\n\n== Cuisine ==\nIn Costa Rica, especially in Atenas, grapefruit are often cooked to remove their sourness, rendering them as sweets; they are also stuffed with dulce de leche, resulting in a dessert called toronja rellena (stuffed grapefruit). In Haiti, grapefruit is used primarily for its juice (jus de Chad\u00e8que), but also is used to make jam (confiture de Chad\u00e8que).\n\n\n== Related citruses ==\n\nGrapefruit is a pomelo backcross, a hybrid of pomelo and sweet orange, which is in turn a pomelo \u00d7 mandarin hybrid.\nThe grapefruit is a parent to many hybrids:\n\nA tangelo is any hybrid of a tangerine and either a pomelo or a grapefruit\n'Minneola': 'Duncan' grapefruit \u00d7 'Dancy' tangerine\nOrlando (formerly Take): Bowen grapefruit \u00d7 'Dancy' tangerine (pollen parent)'Fairchild' is a clementine \u00d7 'Orlando' hybrid\n'Seminole': 'Bowen' grapefruit \u00d7 'Dancy' tangerine\n'Thornton': tangerine \u00d7 grapefruit, unspecified\n'Ugli': mandarin \u00d7 grapefruit, probable (wild seedling)\n'Nova' is a second-generation hybrid: clementine \u00d7 'Orlando' tangelo cross\nThe 'Oroblanco' and 'Melogold' grapefruits are hybrids between pomelo (C. maxima) and the grapefruit\nThe 'Triumph' grapefruit is thought to be a hybrid between a grapefruit and one of either an orange, a mandarin orange, or a pomeloRelated citrus fruits include:\n\nCommon sweet orange: pomelo \u00d7 mandarin hybrid\nBitter orange: a different pomelo \u00d7 mandarin hybrid\nMandelos: pomelo \u00d7 mandarin\nHyuganatsu may also be a pomelo hybrid\nForbidden fruit: pomelo \u00d7 orange hybrid found in Saint Lucia closely related to and historically confused with grapefruits\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nGrapefruit knife \u2013 Knife designed specifically for cutting grapefruit\nGrapefruit spoon \u2013 Kind of spoon intended for use with citrus fruit\nGrapefruit\u2013drug interactions \u2013 Drug interactions with grapefruit juice\nNaringenin\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Data related to Citrus paradisi at Wikispecies", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Flag_of_Mexico.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Flag_of_South_Africa.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Flag_of_Vietnam.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Flag_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Foodlogo2.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ae/Grapefruit-mercaptan-2D-skeletal-vertical.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/Grapefruit.ebola.jpeg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Grapefruits_-_whole-halved-segments.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/KC_Atwood.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d0/Citrus_paradisi_%28Grapefruit%2C_pink%29_white_bg.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg"], "summary": "The grapefruit  (Citrus \u00d7 paradisi) is a subtropical citrus tree known for its relatively large, sour to semisweet, somewhat bitter fruit.

This is remarking on its major use for the Jewish ritual etrog during Sukkot.It was also called pitima, or the cedro col pigolo (\"citron with a pitom\"), because of its usually persisting pitom (carpel). The last does not only enhance its character, but also adds Halachic promotion.\n\n\n== Description and illustration ==\n\nThe following description is from the Nurenbergische Hesperides (2nd Volume; 8th Chap.) by Johann Christoph Volkamer, titled \"About the Cedro col Pigolo\". He was growing that kind in his botanical garden in Nuremberg, and writes that it can also be called the \"Jewish Citron\", since it is mostly used for the four species.\n''This tree does not become particularly big. The leaves are smaller than those of other citrons, and serrated, oblong, pointed towards the front, mixed with many thorns. The bloom is small and reddish from outside. The fruit blossoms (- ''the [[Gynoecium|carpels]]'') are not less oblong from the beginning, appearing as reddish and dark-green; thereafter they turn entirely green, and when they ripen, straw-yellow, remaining, however, rather small all the time and never growing to a proper size, like other kinds of Citron.\n''Such a fruit as the one shown in the illustration grew one year ago in my garden, and I hope to grow more of those. This fruit is pointed above and has at the top a small long distaff (- ''the pitom''); it has a very pleasant smell, very like that of the Florentine citron described below. It contains very little juice and tastes somewhat sour and also somewhat bitter. As it seems, this plant thrives better in pots, than standing in the ground, for this tree of mine has remained very short in height, and its branches have not overgrown the [supporting] stalk.''\n\n\n== Uses and cultivation ==\nThe variety was initially cultivated in towns near Corfu. The etrogim were under the hashgachah of the Corfu rabbis and were transported to Trieste by way of Corfu, and that is why Jews referred to this as the Corfu etrog.\n\nWhile citron trees are still found on Corfu, and in Naxos, the citron is no longer exported from Greece for the ritual purpose. The Crete citron growers sell it for the candied peel, which is called succade, and in Naxos it is distilled into a special aromatic liqueur called kitron.\n\n\n== Role as etrog ==\n\n\n=== Initial source ===\nAccording to the Romaniotes this variety of citron was in their hands since the times of the Second Temple or earlier, and was always used by them for the religious ritual. Afterwards it was appreciated by the Sephardim who settled in Italy, Greece and Turkey, after their exile from Spain in 1492.\nHistorically speaking, the citron is considered by numerous writers, to be introduced to Europe by the troops of Alexander. It was also described by Theophrastus, who succeeded Aristotle as the curator of the Botanical garden in Athens.\n\n\n=== In Ashkenazi hands ===\nWhen the Corfu etrogim started to be imported into the rest of Europe in 1785, the communities adherent through Ashkenazi tradition to the Genoese variety were very skeptical about it. The Ashkenazim assumed that since the Greek is so much different from the Genoese, it might have been grafted or hybridized. At the beginning of the 19th century, when the Yanova Esrog was ceased due to the battles of Napoleon I of France, it really started to dominate the market.\nRabbi Ephraim Zalman Margolis, in his responsa Bet Ephraim (volume 1;56), confirmed that at the time, none of the so-called Corfu etrogim were from grafted citron trees. He argued that, even if it could not be verified whether the plant was propagated by cuttings of grafted plants since the tradition lineage is missing, it should still be considered kosher. Therefore, he concluded that in case no nice, clean and kosher \"Yanove Esrog\" is to be found, the Corfu etrog may be used instead. This certification, as well as the lenient position of many other authorities, eventually opened doors for the permission of this etrog.\n\n\n=== The new places ===\n\nAlexander Ziskind Mintz, an Ashkenazi merchant, started claiming in 1846 that only those growing in Parga are not grafted, and therefore kosher for the ritual. He claimed that under the previous Ottoman system, citrons could only be planted in Parga under the control of Ali Pasha, who collected all proceeds for the Ottoman empire, and those were thus the only citrons known as kosher and un-grafted through the years. Since the rules have been changed, and farmers are allowed to earn their income and pay only a tax, that's how the plantations have expanded to Agia and Preveza. And since those places are new, no one could not be sure whether those picked from newly planted trees, were grafted or not, at least without careful tree checking upon picking.\nThe local Sephardic rabbis in head of Judah Bibas, the Chief Rabbi of Corfu, kept arguing that all of them are kosher, and that not one grafted tree is to be in the regions of cultivation. Their position was supported by the great Rabbi Chaim Palagi the chief rabbi (Hakham Bashi) of \u0130zmir in neighboring Turkey.\nThe dispute ended up with Rabbi Shlomo Kluger banning all sources including, those of Mintz, which were said to be from Parga, and Rabbi Joseph Saul Nathanson permitting all sources, if they bore a certification from the local rabbis.\n\n\n=== The monopoly and its break ===\n\nThis controversy did not significantly decrease the abundance of the Corfu. In 1875, they incorporated themselves into a cartel and drastically raised the price of each single etrog to six florins, assuming that the Jews would have no choice and pay the price.\nThere was an underlying misconception, that there is a belief by the Jews that whoever doesn't reveal a Corfu etrog for Sukkot will not survive the next year. However, this was not the case. The rabbi of Kovno, Rabbi Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor, intended to stop this record-breaking monopoly, and banned the Corfu etrog until the prices would be lowered, and the status of kashrus clarified. Even the rabbi of Corfu certified in a letter that there were already many grafted trees in the region, and the certification process was very complex. The ban was further supported with signatures of many leading rabbis throughout Eastern Europe.\nThe preferred etrog was now the Balady citron of Israel, which had just started being imported, and they regarded even the Corsican citron above the Corfu, while the most respected Genoese citron was very hard to get.\nEach Jewish etrog merchant committed himself to his local rabbi that he would not buy any etrog from the Greek farmers, since this would result in a record breaking expense for the Jewish community, which was impossible for them to pay. This was a great sacrifice from the local Jewry in Corfu, who went without income for the year.\nThis act severely affected the Greek planters and dealers, who, left with high costs and no revenue, were forced to lower prices.\n\n\n=== The blood libel and pogrom ===\n\nIn the pre-Pesach season of 1891, an unidentified female body was found on a street neighboring the Jewish ghetto. The Greek etrog growers made a blood libel, accusing local Jews of the murder.\nThe local Church officials on Corfu (as well as on the other Ionian Islands) maintained a deliberate neutrality during the anti-semitic events and did not support the government's efforts to reestablish order, unlike the high echelons of the Church, who took measures to limit the anti-Semitic mood. Similarly the Greek press played a role in publicizing the unfairness of the accusations. The culprits were never prosecuted, however.After several days of violence, a short investigation found that the victim was Sarda, a member of a famous Jewish family on the Corfu Island, who was killed in sexual violence. The discovery was too late for the total of 139 dead, and this composed the Jewish saying, \"Rather should the etrog have a 'blatt-flaw', [a flaw similar to apple russet that is presumably caused by a scratch from a leaf, this was common in the different varieties of citron but not in the Greek] but not in any case a 'blood-flaw'\", referring to the blood spilled in Corfu. However, the local Jewry did not necessarily appreciate the ban.\n\n\n=== Partial decline ===\nAs a result, the popularity of the Greek citron drastically declined in the eastern European communities that switched to the Balady etrogs, but was still used elsewhere. After World War II, some European Jews who had relocated to Israel or the United States still continued using the Greek for at least two decades.\nIn 1956, Rabbi Yeshaye Gross, a Satmar from Brooklyn, proceeded to visit the orchards in Calabria, and found out that a large percentage of the trees are actually grafted. From then on he realized that no etrog could be picked off the tree without a careful inspection, which he was allowed and able to do.\nThe Greek growers, in contrast, didn't let any Jewish merchants visit their orchards to inspect their trees, and only sold etrogs on Corfu. This forced many Satmars to switch back to the traditional Yanova citron, even not bearing a pitam. The cultivation of the Greek citron was thereafter on concentrated in Halki, Naxos where there is a small production for distillery.\nIn those years, the Moroccan citron took place and appealed for both traditional purity without any history of grafting, and its bearing a persistent healthy pitam.Still the Skverer rebbe manages to get annually one esrog from Corfu. The esrog is brought from Greece by Meyer Knoblach from New Square.\n\n\n== Introduction to Israel ==\nAt about 1850, Sir Moses Montefiore was instrumental in establishing etrog plantations in the Holy Land, in order to help the Jewish settlers to survive. As the Balady citron had little chance for success \u2013 being not so great in shape, color etc., with a persistent style ratio as low as 1;1000 \u2013 the Sephardic settlers, who were always positive about the Corfu, planted its seeds in the coastal region of Israel, especially in the vicinity of Jaffa. The transplantation was witnessed as kosher by the local Sephardic Rabbi Yehuda Halevi.\n\nArab farmers imported cuttings from Greece, which they budded onto rootstock of the Palestinian sweet lime for cleansing diseases and for longer life. The Corfu variety, which they called kubbad abu nunia ('citron with persistent style'), did not acclimatize well in Israeli land, so growers started employing the grafting method on a large scale.\nThe great scholar and kabballist Rabbi Aaron Ezrial of the Beit El Synagogue still certified some ungrafted citron orchards in Jaffa by eliminating the plants he found to be grafted. The Greek-Jaffa citron was also promoted by most of the Sephardic and even some Ashkenazic rabbis, who saw a great future in the beautiful and pitamed variety. The permission was based upon inspection of each and every tree prior to picking, just like it is practiced today in Calabria.In the following time, the Greek citron of Jaffa pushed the Balady citron off the market. The Jaffa Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook founded and headed the \"Atzei Hadar\" union for kosher etrog cultivators and marketers, to prevent grafting the Jaffa etrog unto rootstock of sour orange or sweet lime, but very much promoted intraspecific grafting of the Greek citron upon Balady citron rootstock, which is permitted by Halacha.\nThe act led to the establishment of a beautiful variety in Israel, yet kosher, and saved the economy of Israel for decades. As of today it is the leading variety in Israel, and is a very important article in international trade.\n\n\n=== Suspicions ===\n\nAlthough the graft of Greek citron on Balady rootstock was a great idea from practical and Halachic views, it induced suspicion from customers who wondered why the Israeli citron was suddenly so beautiful with an erect pitam. Suspicion arose in Israel and in the diaspora, and many rumors spread.\nThe late Grand Rabbi of Munkatch, Chaim Elazar Spira, was aware of the change. He speculated that it was the same problem continuously claimed against the Greek in their homeland Greece, namely to be grafted or bred with lemon, which renders it non-kosher.This was not completely false, since those not supervised were grafted also onto bitter orange or limetta. Also, even with supervision it is very hard to detect the rootstock type, while not the same as the scion.\nSuch skeptical views about the beautiful Greek-Israeli citron, were also expressed by the Rabbi Solomon Eliezer Alfandari, and by the former chief rabbi Ovadia Yosef.\nLater an ungrafted tree was found in the backyard of a Shochet in Hadera with the name ordang. Today, most Hasidic communities in Israel, as well as in the diaspora, are using descendants of this strain while planted under rabbinical Hashgacha.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHistory of the Jews in Greece\nIsser Zalman Meltzer\nKehila Kedosha Janina\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== HaLevanon links ===\nThe etrog controversy in the years of 1875\u20136 was mainly led by the Hebrew newspaper HaLevanon.

'Nippon' is the only named cultivar.\n\n\n== Description ==\nThis is a small, round, orange fruit, which is larger than a kumquat. The fruit ranges from 2\u20134 cm (0.79\u20131.57 in) in circumference. Orangequats can be eaten whole, including rind, but they have a very bitter and sour taste and most contain seeds. Orangequat trees are small to medium in size; the leaves are usually long and narrow and dark green in color. The trunk and branches of the trees are slightly narrow, given the size of the trees. These trees can be seen with fruits on them through many of the colder months, since that is the season for orangequat growing. Orangequats have not been genetically altered to be resistant to citrus canker, a citrus disease that causes small round sores on the fruit and its tree. The orangequat also has not been bred to be seedless or sweet; it is very tart, and has a fair amount of rather large seeds inside.\n\n\n== Background ==\nThe Meiwa kumquat, a hybrid of a round and an oval kumquat, and the Satsuma mandarin are the two fruits that were used to parent the Nippon orangequat. Both of these fruits are able to withstand cooler climates, the meiwa being partially dormant in the winter months  and the satsuma maturing in October to December. Since both of these citruses are able to grow in the colder season, the orangequat inherited that trait and is also grown and harvested in the colder seasons. Both of the parents of the orangequat are grown in many countries of the world, like China, Japan, South Africa, and the United States of America.

The name is a portmanteau of 'tangerine' and 'pomelo'. \nTangelos are the size of an adult fist, have a tart and tangy taste, and are juicy at the expense of flesh. They generally have loose skin and are easier to peel than oranges, readily distinguished from them by a characteristic \"nipple\" at the stem. Tangelos can be used as a substitute for mandarin oranges or sweet oranges.\n\n\n== Varieties ==\n\n\n=== Orlando ===\nThe early maturing Orlando tangelo is noted for its rich juiciness, mild and sweet flavor, large size, distinct zesty smell, and flat-round shape without a characteristic knob. California/Arizona tangelos have a slightly pebbled texture, vibrant interior and exterior color, very few seeds, and a tight-fitting rind. Orlando tangelos are available from mid-November to the beginning of February. The tangelo originated as a cross between a Duncan grapefruit and a Dancy mandarin.  Walter Tennyson Swingle of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is credited with creating the hybrid in 1911. When the Orlando tangelo was first cultivated, it was known by the name Lake tangelo. The trees of this variety grow to a large size and are easily recognized by their cup-shape leaves. Orlando tangelos are recognized as one of the more cold-tolerant varieties. Northern Florida grows significantly fewer tangelos, but they are much sweeter due to climate.\n\n\n=== Minneola ===\nThe Minneola tangelo (also known as the Honeybell) is a cross between a Duncan grapefruit and a Dancy mandarin, and was released in 1931 by the USDA Horticultural Research Station in Orlando.  It is named after Minneola, Florida.  Most Minneola tangelos are characterized by a stem-end neck, which tends to make the fruit appear bell-shaped. Because of this, it is also called the Honeybell in the gift fruit trade, where it is one of the most popular varieties. Both Minneolas and Honeybells are usually fairly large, typically 3\u20133+1\u20442 inches (76\u201389 mm) in diameter; the Honeybells tend to be larger and sweeter. The peel color, when mature, is a bright-reddish-orange color. The rind of the Minneola is relatively thin, while the rind of the Honeybell is slightly thicker. Both the Minneola and Honeybell Tangelo peel rather easily. Both are very juicy. Both the Minneola and the Honeybell are not strongly self-fruitful, and yields will be greater when interplanted with suitable pollenizers such as Temple tangor, Sunburst tangerine, or possibly Fallglo tangerine. It tends to bear a good crop every other year. In the Northern Hemisphere the fruit matures in the December\u2013February period, with January being the peak.\n\n\n=== Jamaican tangelo ===\n\nThe Jamaican tangelo, marketed under proprietary names ugli fruit and uniq fruit, is a spontaneous hybrid discovered about 1920 on the island of Jamaica, with a rough, wrinkled, greenish-yellow rind. Its exact parentage has not been determined, but it is thought to be a tangerine/grapefruit hybrid.\n\n\n=== K-Early (Sunrise) ===\nA hybrid propagated by Walter Tennyson Swingle and Herbert John Webber, the K-Early is an early-ripening cultivar which gained a bad reputation at first but has been increasing in popularity in recent years. It is sometimes called 'Sunrise', a name also used for a different and older cultivar.\n\n\n=== Seminole ===\nThe seminole is a hybrid between a 'Bowen' grapefruit and a 'Dancy' tangerine. It is deep red-orange in color and oblate in shape with a thin and firm peel, and is not necked. It has 11-13 juicy segments and a pleasant, subacid flavor. It has 20-25 small seeds. The tree is high-yielding and scab-resistant.\n\n\n=== Thornton ===\nA tangerine-grapefruit hybrid developed by Walter Tennyson Swingle in 1899, the Thornton is oblate to obovate in shape, slightly rough, and medium to large in size. The peel is light orange in color and is of a medium thickness; the pulp inside is pale to deep orange. It has 10-12 juicy segments and a rich subacid to sweet flavor. There are 10-25 slender seeds inside. It ripens from December to March. The tree is high-yielding and is well-adapted to hot and dry regions, although the fruit ships poorly.\n\n\n=== Novel varieties ===\nIn 2011, a troop of baboons were attracted to the higher sweetness of a new likely mutation in a Minneola planting in Cape Town, South Africa, prompting its propagation.\n\n\n== Drug interactions ==\nOne study thus far has shown that, unlike grapefruit, interactions with statins are not likely with tangelos. Although the tangelo is derived from a grapefruit crossed with a mandarin, the furocoumarins in grapefruit are not expressed in tangelos.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Minneola_fruit_3.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Wikispecies-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg"], "summary": "The tangelo ( TAN-j\u0259-loh,  tan-JEL-oh; C. reticulata \u00d7 C. maxima or \u00d7 C. paradisi; sometimes referred to as honeybells), Citrus \u00d7 tangelo,  is a citrus fruit hybrid of a Citrus reticulata variety, such as a mandarin orange or tangerine, and a Citrus maxima variety, such as a pomelo or grapefruit.

Its scent is sweet, honeyed and somewhat metallic with green and spicy facets. Orange blossom is also extracted from the same blossom and both extracts are extensively used in perfumery. Orange blossom can be described as smelling sweeter, warmer and more floral than neroli. The difference between how neroli and orange blossom smell and why they are referred to with different names, is a result of the process of extraction that is used to obtain the oil from the blooms. Neroli is extracted by steam distillation and orange blossom is extracted via a process of enfleurage (rarely used nowadays due to prohibitive costs) or solvent extraction.\n\n\n== Production ==\nThe blossoms are gathered, usually by hand, in late April to early May. The oil is extracted by steam distillation. Tunisia, Morocco, and Egypt are the leading producers of Neroli.\n\n\n== History ==\nBy the end of the 17th century, Anne Marie Orsini, duchess of Bracciano and princess of Nerola, Italy, introduced the essence of bitter orange tree as a fashionable fragrance by using it to perfume her gloves and her bath. Since then, the term \"neroli\" has been used to describe this essence. Neroli has a refreshing and distinctive, spicy aroma with sweet and flowery notes.\n\n\n== Use ==\n\nNeroli is one of the most widely used floral oils in perfumery. Like many raw materials, neroli can cause sensitisation due to a high content of aromatic terpenes; e.g., linalool, limonene, farnesol, geraniol and citral.  It blends well with any citrus oil, various floral absolutes, and most of the synthetic components available on the market. \nIt also has a limited use in flavorings. Neroli oil is reportedly one of the ingredients in the closely guarded secret recipe for the Coca-Cola soft drink. It is a flavoring ingredient of open source cola recipes, although some variants consider it as optional, owing to the high cost.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCitrus \u00d7 aurantium\nNerol\nOrange flower water\nOrange oil\nPetitgrain oil\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEntry in the British Pharmaceutical Codex from 1911", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/57/Citrus_aurantium_-_K%C3%B6hler%E2%80%93s_Medizinal-Pflanzen-042.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Neroli.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg"], "summary": "Neroli oil is an essential oil produced from the blossom of the bitter orange tree (Citrus aurantium subsp. amara or Bigaradia).

It is a natural, i.e., non-hybrid, citrus fruit, native to Southeast Asia. Similar in taste to a sweet grapefruit, the pomelo is commonly consumed and used for festive occasions throughout Southeast Asia. Like the grapefruit, the pomelo has the potential for drug interactions.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, the etymology of the word \"pomelo\" is uncertain. It may be derived from Dutch pompelmoes. Its botanical name, Citrus maxima, means \"biggest citrus\". In English, the word \"pomelo\" (also spelled pomello, pummelo, pommelo, pumelo) has become the more common name, although \"pomelo\" has historically been used for grapefruit.\nAfter a captain Shaddock of an East India Company ship introduced it to Barbados, the fruit was called \"shaddock\" in English. From there the name spread to Jamaica in 1696. The fruit is also known as jabong in Hawaii and jambola in varieties of English spoken in South Asia. In Nepali, it is known as \"bhogate (\u092d\u094b\u0917\u091f\u0947)\".\n\n\n== Description and uses ==\nThe pomelo tree may be 5\u201315 m (16\u201350 ft) tall, possibly with a crooked trunk 10\u201330 cm (4\u201312 in) thick, and low-hanging, irregular branches. Leaf petioles are distinctly winged, with alternate, ovate or elliptic shapes 5\u201320 cm (2\u20138 in) long, with a leathery, dull green upper layer, and hairy underleaf. The flowers \u2014 single or in clusters \u2014 are fragrant and yellow-white in color.The fruit is large, 15\u201325 cm (6\u201310 in) in diameter, usually weighing 1\u20132 kg (2\u20134 lb). It has a thicker rind than a grapefruit, and is divided into 11 to 18 segments. The flesh tastes like a mild grapefruit, with little of its common bitterness (the grapefruit is a hybrid of the pomelo and the orange). The enveloping membranes around the segments are chewy and bitter, considered inedible, and usually discarded. There are two varieties: a sweet kind with white flesh, and a sour kind with pinkish flesh, the latter more likely to be used in ceremonies, rather than eaten. The fruit generally contains few, relatively large seeds, but some varieties have numerous seeds.The juice is regarded as delicious, and the rind is used to make preserves or may be candied. In Brazil, the thick skin may be used for making a sweet conserve, while the spongy pith of the rind is discarded. In Sri Lanka, it is often eaten as a dessert, sometimes sprinkled with sugar. In large parts of Southeast Asia where pomelo is native, it is a common dessert, often sprinkled with or dipped in a salt mixture. It is eaten in salads. In the Philippines, a pink beverage is made from pomelo and pineapple juice.The fruit may have been introduced to China around 100 BCE. In East Asia, especially in Cantonese cuisine, braised pomelo pith is used to make dishes that are high in fibre and nutritional value and low in fat.\n\n\n=== Propagation and genetic diversity ===\nThe seeds of the pomelo are monoembryonic, producing seedlings with genes from both parents, but they are usually similar to the tree they grow on and therefore pomelo is typically grown from seed in Asia. Seeds can be stored for 80 days at a temperature of 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F) and with moderate relative humidity. Citrus maxima is usually grafted onto other citrus rootstocks outside Asia to produce trees that are identical to the parent; high-quality varieties are propagated by air-layering or by budding onto favored rootstocks.The physical and chemical characteristics of pomelo vary widely across South Asia.\n\n\n== Varieties ==\n\n\n=== Non-hybrid pomelos ===\nDangyuja\n\n\n=== Possible non-hybrid pomelos ===\nBanpeiyu\n\n\n=== Hybrids ===\n\nThe pomelo is one of the original citrus species from which cultivated citrus fruits have been hybridized, others being citron, mandarin, and to a lesser extent, papedas and kumquat. In particular, the common orange is presumed to be a naturally occurring hybrid between the pomelo and the mandarin with the pomelo providing the larger size and greater firmness. The grapefruit was originally also presumed to be a naturally occurring hybrid of the pomelo and the mandarin; however, genome analysis conducted more than two centuries after this presumption was made shows that it is actually a backcrossed hybrid between a pomelo and a sweet orange which is why 63% of the grapefruit's genome comes from the pomelo. The pomelo is employed today in artificial breeding programs:\n\nThe common sweet orange (Citrus \u00d7 sinensis) is a pomelo \u00d7 mandarin hybrid\nThe bitter orange (Citrus \u00d7 aurantium) is another pomelo \u00d7 mandarin hybrid\nThe tangelo is a hybrid between pomelo or grapefruit and any tangerine; it generally has a thicker skin than a tangerine and is less sweet\n'K\u2013Early' ('Sunrise Tangelo')\n'Minneola tangelo': Bowen grapefruit \u00d7 Dancy tangerine\n'Orlando' (formerly 'Take'): Bowen grapefruit \u00d7 Dancy tangerine (pollen parent)\n'Seminole': Bowen grapefruit \u00d7 Dancy tangerine\n'Thornton': tangerine \u00d7 grapefruit, unspecified\n'Ugli fruit' (Jamaican tangelo): mandarin \u00d7 grapefruit, probable (wild seedling)\nGrapefruit is a pomelo backcross: pomelo \u00d7 sweet orange (see above)\n'Nova': Clementine \u00d7 Orlando tangelo cross\nThe Oroblanco and Melogold grapefruits are hybrids between Citrus maxima and the grapefruit\nMandelos: pomelo \u00d7 mandarin\nHyuganatsu is a pomelo hybrid\nKawachi Bankan: ujukitsu x unidentified\n\n\n== Nutrition ==\nRaw pomelo flesh is 89% water, 10% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and contains negligible fat (table). A 100 gram reference amount provides 159 kilojoules (38 kilocalories) of food energy, and is rich in vitamin C (73% of the Daily Value), with no other micronutrients in significant content.\n\n\n== Potential for drug interaction ==\n\nPomelo may cause adverse effects, similar to those caused by grapefruit and some other citrus fruits, through the inhibition of cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism of prescription drugs such as anti-hypertensives and anticoagulants.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References ==", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1e/B%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Fi.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ac/Caligrapefruit.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Citrus_maxima0.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Citrus_maxima_%28Pampelmuse%29_001.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Citrus_maxima_%28Pampelmuse%29_004.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Citrus_maxima_%28Pampelmuse%29_005.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/Mid-Autumn_Festival_33%2C_Chinatown%2C_Singapore%2C_Sep_06.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/Pomelo_In_Village.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Pomelo_flesh.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Pomelo_flower.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Pomelo_seedling.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/Pomelos_02.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5b/Pummelo_HBuntan_Pink1_Asit.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/aa/Pummelo_cut.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Pummelo_or_Pamplemousse_%28Citrus_maxima_%28Burm.%29_Merr.%29%3B_flowe_Wellcome_V0042686.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Pummelos.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Red_Pencil_Icon.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5a/Status_iucn3.1_LC.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Tam_som-o_nam_pu.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/V%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Dn_b%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Fi.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Xiancun_-_pomelo_orchards_-_DSCF4064.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Pomelo_fruit.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg"], "summary": "The pomelo (), pummelo (), or in scientific terms Citrus maxima or Citrus grandis, is the largest citrus fruit from the family Rutaceae and the principal ancestor of the grapefruit.
