"Nagaoka dialect is a dialect of the Japanese language spoken in Ch\u016betsu region centered Nagaoka city in Niigata prefecture of Japan. Nagaoka dialect is similar to Niigata dialect spoken in the Southern Kaetsu region. It differs somewhat from town to town.\n\n\n== Accent ==\nThe accent of the Nagaoka dialect is classified as being among the outer range of the Tokyo accent group. With the development of modern media and transportation in recent years, there has been a trend, mostly among younger people, to use the middle range of the Tokyo accent group, which was originally used only in Itoigawa. For example, two-syllable words originally having a heiban accent, meaning a word ending with a high pitch that carries over to the following particle, have changed to an odaka accent, meaning the high pitch no longer carries over to the particle.\nSome additional difference from the standard Tokyo dialect:\n\n\n== Grammar ==\n\n\n=== ga ===\nThe postposition ga is probably the best known element of the Nagaoka dialect. It is typically placed at the end of sentences to alter the speaker's tone. It is basically equivalent to (no da) yo or no in standard Japanese. It is often pronounced with a lengthened vowel sound, i.e. g\u0101, written in Japanese as \u304c\u30fc or \u304c\u3041.\nFeatures of ga:\n\nWhen spoken with rising intonation it can often indicate a question, while falling intonation often shows the speaker's understanding or concent.\nUnlike regular postpositions, additional postpositions can be added after ga, such as ka, ya and te.\nThe copula da/desu and the polite form -masu can be abbreviated when ga is added, e.g. \"This is Nagaoka.\" which would be rendered in standard Japanese as Koko wa Nagaoka na n da (\u3053\u3053\u306f\u9577\u5ca1\u306a\u3093\u3060) would be Koko wa Nagaoka n ga (\u3053\u3053\u306f\u9577\u5ca1\u3093\u304c) (Note that na has also been lost). Other auxiliary verbs are not removed.\n\n\n=== te ===\nLike ga, te is generally attached to the end of a sentence, and carries a meaning similar to (da) yo in standard Japanese. Unlike ga, however, da, desu and -masu are not removed when te is added, e.g. \"This is Nagaoka\", rendered in standard Japanese as Koko wa Nagaoka da yo (\u3053\u3053\u306f\u9577\u5ca1\u3060\u3088) would be Koko wa Nagaoka da te (\u3053\u3053\u306f\u9577\u5ca1\u3060\u3066) in Nagaoka dialect.\n\n\n=== ra ===\nThe copula da and its derivative dar\u014d are replaced with ra and raro, e.g. standard Japanese S\u014d dar\u014d? (\u305d\u3046\u3060\u308d\u3046\uff1f) becomes S\u014d raro? (\u305d\u3046\u3089\u308d\uff1f) in Nagaoka dialect.\n\n\n== Vocabulary ==\nBelow is a list of example words from the Nagaoka dialect:\n\n\n== References =="
