"Hepburn romanization (Japanese: \u30d8\u30dc\u30f3\u5f0f\u30ed\u30fc\u30de\u5b57, Hepburn: Hebon-shiki r\u014dmaji) is the most widely-used system of romanization for the Japanese language. Originally published in 1867 by American missionary James Curtis Hepburn as the standard in the first edition of his Japanese\u2013English dictionary, the system is distinct from other romanization methods in its use of English orthography to phonetically transcribe sounds: for example, the syllable [\u0255i] is written as shi and [t\u0255a] is written as cha, reflecting their spellings in English (compare to si and tya in the more-systematic Nihon-shiki and Kunrei-shiki systems).\nIn 1886, Hepburn published the third edition of his dictionary, codifying a revised version of the system that is known today as \"traditional Hepburn\". A version with additional revisions, known as \"modified Hepburn\", was published in 1908.\nAlthough Kunrei-shiki romanization is the style favored by the Japanese government, Hepburn remains the most popular method of Japanese romanization. It is learned by most foreign students of the language, and is used within Japan for romanizing personal names, locations, and other information, such as train tables and road signs. Because the system's orthography is based on English phonology instead of a systematic transcription of the Japanese syllabary, individuals who only speak English or a Romance language will generally be more accurate when pronouncing unfamiliar words romanized in the Hepburn style compared to other systems.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1867, American Presbyterian missionary doctor James Curtis Hepburn published the first Japanese\u2013English dictionary, in which he introduced a new system for the romanization of Japanese into Latin script. He published a second edition in 1872 and a third edition in 1886, which introduced minor changes. The third edition's system had been adopted in the previous year by the R\u014dmaji-kai (\u7f85\u99ac\u5b57\u4f1a, \"Romanization Club\"), a group of Japanese and foreign scholars who promoted a replacement of the Japanese script with a romanized system.Hepburn romanization, loosely based on the conventions of English orthography (spelling), stood in opposition to Nihon-shiki romanization, which had been developed in Japan in 1881 as a script replacement. Compared to Hepburn, Nihon-shiki is more systematic in its representation of the Japanese syllabary (kana), as each symbol corresponds to a phoneme. However, the notation requires further explanation for accurate pronunciation by non-Japanese speakers: for example, the syllables [\u0255i] and [t\u0255a], which are written as shi and cha in Hepburn, are rendered as si and tya in Nihon-shiki. After Nihon-shiki was presented to the R\u014dmaji-kai in 1886, a dispute began between the supporters of the two systems, which resulted in a standstill and an eventual halt to the organization's activities in 1892.After the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u201305), the two factions resurfaced as the Romaji Hirome-kai (\u30ed\u30fc\u30de\u5b57\u3072\u308d\u3081\u4f1a, \"Society for the Spread of Romanization\"), which supported Hepburn's style, and the Nihon no Romaji-sha (\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u30ed\u30fc\u30de\u5b57\u793e, \"Romanization Society of Japan\"), which supported Nihon-shiki. In 1908, Hepburn was revised by educator Kan\u014d Jigor\u014d and others of the Romaji Hirome-kai, which began calling it the Sh\u016bsei Hebon-shiki (\u4fee\u6b63\u30d8\u30dc\u30f3\u5f0f, \"modified Hepburn system\") or Hy\u014djun-shiki (\u6a19\u6e96\u5f0f, \"standard system\").In 1930, a Special Romanization Study Commission, headed by the Minister of Education, was appointed by the government to devise a standardized form of romanization. The Commission eventually decided on a slightly modified \"compromise\" version of Nihon-shiki, which was chosen for official use by cabinet ordinance on September 21, 1937; this system is known today as Kunrei-shiki romanization. On September 3, 1945, at the beginning of the occupation of Japan after World War II, Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers Douglas MacArthur issued a directive mandating the use of modified Hepburn by occupation forces. The directive had no legal force, however, and a revised version of Kunrei-shiki was reissued by cabinet ordinance on December 9, 1954, after the end of occupation.Although it lacks de jure status, Hepburn remains the de facto standard for some applications in Japan. As of 1977, many government organizations used Hepburn, including the Ministry of International Trade and Industry; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requires the use of Hepburn on passports, and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport requires its use on transport signs, including road signs and railway station signs. Hepburn is also used by private organizations, including The Japan Times and the Japan Travel Bureau.American National Standard System for the Romanization of Japanese (ANSI Z39.11-1972), based on modified Hepburn, was approved in 1971 and published in 1972 by the American National Standards Institute. In 1989, it was proposed for International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 3602, but was rejected in favor of Kunrei-shiki. ANSI Z39.11-1972 was deprecated as a standard in 1994.\n\n\n== Variants ==\n\nThere are many variants of the Hepburn romanization. The two most common styles are as follows:\n\nTraditional Hepburn, as defined in various editions of Hepburn's dictionary, with the third edition (1886) often considered authoritative (although changes in kana usage must be accounted for). It is characterized by the rendering of syllabic n as m before the consonants b, m and p: for example, Shimbashi for \u65b0\u6a4b.\nModified Hepburn, also known as Revised Hepburn, in which (among other changes) the rendering of syllabic n as m before certain consonants is no longer used: Shinbashi for \u65b0\u6a4b. The version of the system published in the third (1954) and later editions of Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary are often considered authoritative; it was adopted in 1989 by the Library of Congress as one of its ALA-LC romanizations, and is the most common variant of Hepburn romanization used today.In Japan itself, there are some variants officially mandated for various uses:\n\nRailway Standard (\u9244\u9053\u63b2\u793a\u57fa\u6e96\u898f\u7a0b, Tetsud\u014d Keiji Kijun Kitei), which mostly follows Modified Hepburn, except syllabic n is rendered as in Traditional. Japan Railways and other major railways use it for station names.\nMinistry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Standard,\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs Passport Standard (\u5916\u52d9\u7701\u65c5\u5238\u898f\u5b9a, Gaimush\u014d Ryoken Kitei), a permissive standard, which explicitly allows the use of \"non-Hepburn romaji\" (\u975e\u30d8\u30dc\u30f3\u5f0f\u30ed\u30fc\u30de\u5b57, hi-Hebon-shiki r\u014dmaji) in personal names, notably for passports. In particular, it renders the syllabic n as m before b, m and p, and romanizes the long vowel \u014d as oh, oo or ou (Satoh, Satoo or Satou for \u4f50\u85e4).Details of the variants can be found below.\n\n\n=== Obsolete variants ===\nThe romanizations set out in the first and second versions of Hepburn's dictionary are primarily of historical interest. Notable differences from the third and later versions include:\n\n\n== Features ==\nThe main feature of Hepburn is that its orthography is based on English phonology. More technically, when syllables that are constructed systematically according to the Japanese syllabary contain an \"unstable\" consonant in the modern spoken language, the orthography is changed to something that better matches the real sound as an English-speaker would pronounce it. For example, \u3057 is written shi not si. This transcription is thus only partly phonological.\nSome linguists such as Harold E. Palmer, Daniel Jones and Otto Jespersen object to Hepburn since the pronunciation-based spellings can obscure the systematic origins of Japanese phonetic structures, inflections, and conjugations. Supporters of Hepburn argue that it is not intended as a linguistic tool, and that individuals who only speak English or a Romance language will generally be more accurate when pronouncing unfamiliar words romanized in the Hepburn style compared to other systems.\n\n\n=== Long vowels ===\nIn Hepburn, vowel combinations that form a long sound are usually indicated with a macron ( \u00af ). Other adjacent vowels, such as those separated by a morpheme boundary, are written separately:\n\nAll other vowel combinations are always written separately:\n\nE + I: \u5236 (\u305b\u3044)\u670d (\u3075\u304f) \u2013 sei + fuku \u2013 seifuku 'uniform'\nU + I: \u8efd (\u304b\u308b)\u3044 \u2013 karu + i \u2013 karui 'light (in weight)'\nO + I: \u7525 (\u304a\u3044) \u2013 oi \u2013 oi 'nephew'\n\n\n==== Loanwords ====\nIn foreign loanwords, long vowels followed by a ch\u014donpu (\u30fc) are indicated with macrons:\n\n\u30bb\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc: se + (\u30fc) + ra + (\u30fc) = s\u0113r\u0101 'sailor'\n\u30bf\u30af\u30b7\u30fc: ta + ku + shi + (\u30fc) = takush\u012b 'taxi'\n\u30b3\u30f3\u30af\u30fc\u30eb: ko + n + ku + (\u30fc) + ru = konk\u016bru 'competition'\n\u30d0\u30ec\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb: ba + re + (\u30fc) + bo + (\u30fc) + ru = bar\u0113b\u014dru 'volleyball'\n\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb: so + (\u30fc) + ru = s\u014dru 'sole (of a shoe, etc.)'Adjacent vowels in loanwords are written separately:\n\n\u30d0\u30ec\u30a8: ba + re + e \u2013 baree 'ballet'\n\u30df\u30a4\u30e9: mi + i + ra \u2013 miira 'mummy'\n\u30bd\u30a6\u30eb: so + u + ru \u2013 souru 'soul', 'Seoul'\n\n\n==== Variations ====\nThere are many variations on the Hepburn system for indicating long vowels with a macron. For example, \u6771\u4eac (\u3068\u3046\u304d\u3087\u3046) is properly romanized as T\u014dky\u014d, but can also be written as:\n\nTokyo \u2013 not indicated at all. Common for Japanese words that have been adopted into English, and the de facto convention for Hepburn used in signs and other English-language information around Japan.\nT\u00f4ky\u00f4 \u2013 indicated with circumflex accents, as in the alternative Nihon-shiki and Kunrei-shiki romanizations. They are often used when macrons are unavailable or difficult to input, due to their visual similarity.\nTohkyoh \u2013 indicated with an h (only applies after o). This is sometimes known as \"passport Hepburn\", as the Japanese Foreign Ministry has authorized (but not required) it in passports.\nToukyou \u2013 written using kana spelling: \u014d as ou or oo (depending on the kana). This is also known as w\u0101puro style, as it reflects how text is entered into a Japanese word processor by using a keyboard with Roman characters. W\u0101puro more accurately represents the way that \u014d is written in kana by differentiating between \u304a\u3046 (as in \u3068\u3046\u304d\u3087\u3046 (\u6771\u4eac), Toukyou in w\u0101puro) and \u304a\u304a (as in \u3068\u304a\u3044 (\u9060\u3044), tooi in w\u0101puro); however, it fails to differentiate between long vowels and vowels separated by a morpheme boundary.\nTookyoo \u2013 written by doubling the long vowels. Some dictionaries such as the Pocket Kenkyusha Japanese Dictionary and Basic English Writers' Japanese-English Wordbook follow this style, and it is also used in the JSL form of romanization.\n\n\n=== Particles ===\nIn traditional and modified:\n\nWhen \u306f is used as a particle, it is written wa.In traditional Hepburn:\n\nWhen \u3078 is used as a particle, Hepburn originally recommended ye. This spelling is obsolete, and it is commonly written as e (Romaji-Hirome-Kai, 1974).\nWhen \u3092 is used as a particle, it is written wo.In modified Hepburn:\nWhen \u3078 is used as a particle, it is written e.\nWhen \u3092 is used as a particle, it is written o.\n\n\n=== Syllabic n ===\nIn traditional Hepburn:\nSyllabic n (\u3093) is written as n before consonants, but as m before labial consonants: b, m, and p. It is sometimes written as n- (with a hyphen) before vowels and y (to avoid confusion between, for example, \u3093\u3042 n + a and \u306a na, and \u3093\u3084 n + ya and \u306b\u3083 nya), but its hyphen usage is not clear.\u6848\u5185\uff08\u3042\u3093\u306a\u3044\uff09: annai \u2013 guide\n\u7fa4\u99ac\uff08\u3050\u3093\u307e\uff09: Gumma \u2013 Gunma\n\u7c21\u6613\uff08\u304b\u3093\u3044\uff09: kan-i \u2013 simple\n\u4fe1\u7528\uff08\u3057\u3093\u3088\u3046\uff09: shin-y\u014d \u2013 trustIn modified Hepburn:\nThe rendering m before labial consonants is not used and is replaced with n. It is written n' (with an apostrophe) before vowels and y.\u6848\u5185\uff08\u3042\u3093\u306a\u3044\uff09: annai \u2013 guide\n\u7fa4\u99ac\uff08\u3050\u3093\u307e\uff09: Gunma \u2013 Gunma\n\u7c21\u6613\uff08\u304b\u3093\u3044\uff09: kan'i \u2013 simple\n\u4fe1\u7528\uff08\u3057\u3093\u3088\u3046\uff09: shin'y\u014d \u2013 trust\n\n\n=== Long consonants ===\nElongated (or \"geminate\") consonant sounds are marked by doubling the consonant following a sokuon, \u3063; for consonants that are digraphs in Hepburn (sh, ch, ts), only the first consonant of the set is doubled, except for ch, which is replaced by tch.\n\u7d50\u679c\uff08\u3051\u3063\u304b\uff09: kekka \u2013 result\n\u3055\u3063\u3055\u3068: sassato \u2013 quickly\n\u305a\u3063\u3068: zutto \u2013 all the time\n\u5207\u7b26\uff08\u304d\u3063\u3077\uff09: kippu \u2013 ticket\n\u96d1\u8a8c\uff08\u3056\u3063\u3057\uff09: zasshi \u2013 magazine\n\u4e00\u7dd2\uff08\u3044\u3063\u3057\u3087\uff09: issho \u2013 together\n\u3053\u3063\u3061: kotchi (not kocchi) \u2013 this way\n\u62b9\u8336\uff08\u307e\u3063\u3061\u3083\uff09: matcha (not maccha) \u2013 matcha\n\u4e09\u3064\uff08\u307f\u3063\u3064\uff09: mittsu \u2013 three\n\n\n== Romanization charts ==\nEach entry contains hiragana, katakana, and Hepburn romanization, in that order.\n\u2020 \u2014 The characters in red are rare historical characters and are obsolete in modern Japanese. In modern Hepburn romanization, they are often undefined.\n\u2021 \u2014 The characters in blue are rarely used outside of their status as a particle in modern Japanese, and romanization follows the rules above.\n\n\n=== Extended katakana ===\nThese combinations are used mainly to represent the sounds in words in other languages.\nDigraphs with orange backgrounds are the general ones used for loanwords or foreign places or names, and those with blue backgrounds are used for more accurate transliterations of foreign sounds, both suggested by the Cabinet of Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. Katakana combinations with beige backgrounds are suggested by the American National Standards Institute and the British Standards Institution as possible uses. Ones with purple backgrounds appear on the 1974 version of the Hy\u014djun-shiki formatting.\n* \u2014 The use of \u30a6 in these two cases to represent w is rare in modern Japanese except for Internet slang and transcription of the Latin sound [w] into katakana. E.g.: \u30df\u30cd\u30eb\u30a6\u30a1 (Mineruwa \"Minerva\", from Latin MINERVA [m\u026a\u02c8n\u025brwa]); \u30a6\u30a5\u30eb\u30ab\u30fc\u30cc\u30b9 (Wuruk\u0101nusu \"Vulcan\", from Latin VVLCANVS, Vulc\u0101nus [w\u028al\u02c8ka\u02d0n\u028as]). The wa-type of foreign sounds (as in watt or white) is usually transcribed to \u30ef (wa), while the wu-type (as in wood or woman) is usually to \u30a6 (u) or \u30a6\u30fc (\u016b).\n\u2051 \u2014 \u30f4 has a rarely-used hiragana form in \u3094 that is also vu in Hepburn romanization systems.\n\u2042 \u2014 The characters in green are obsolete in modern Japanese and very rarely used.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of ISO romanizations\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPreface of first edition of Hepburn's original dictionary, explaining romanization\nPreface of third edition of Hepburn's original dictionary, explaining romanization"
