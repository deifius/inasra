Sanrio depicts Hello Kitty as a young female gijinka (anthropomorphization) of a Japanese Bobtail cat with a red bow and no mouth. According to her backstory, she is a perpetual 3rd-grade student who lives outside of London. Kitty and her twin sister, Mimi, celebrate their birthday on 1 November 1974. Since the cartoon character's creation, the Hello Kitty media franchise has grown to include clothing, accessories, toys, games, books, manga, anime series, and music albums, along with other various product lines and media productions.\nShortly after Hello Kitty's creation in 1974, the Hello Kitty vinyl coin purse was introduced by Sanrio in March 1975. Sanrio brought the character to the United States in 1976. By 2010, Sanrio had turned Hello Kitty into a global marketing phenomenon, worth $6 billion a year. By 2014, when Hello Kitty was 40 years old, she was worth about $8 billion a year. Hello Kitty has become one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.\nHello Kitty is a staple of the kawaii segment of Japanese popular culture. First marketed toward pre-teenage girls, Hello Kitty's image found commercial success among not only her original target audience but adolescent and adult consumers as well. A variety of products ranging from school supplies to fashion accessories to motor oil have featured the character over the years. A number of Hello Kitty TV series targeted towards children have been produced, as well as several manga comics and anime films. There are Sanrio theme parks based on Hello Kitty: Harmonyland in Hiji, \u014cita, Japan; Sanrio Puroland in Tama New Town, Tokyo, Japan; and the former Sanrio Hello Kitty Town in Iskandar Puteri, Johor, Malaysia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nIn 1962, Shintaro Tsuji, founder of Sanrio, began selling rubber sandals with flowers painted on them. Tsuji noted the profits gained by adding a cute design to the shoes and hired cartoonists to design cute characters for his merchandise. The company produced a line of character merchandise centered around gift-giving occasions. Hello Kitty was designed by Yuko Shimizu and was added to the lineup of early Sanrio characters in 1974. The character's first appearance on an item was in March 1975 on a vinyl coin purse sold in Japan, where she was pictured sitting between a bottle of milk and a goldfish bowl. She first appeared in the United States in 1976 when Sanrio opened a Gift Gate store in San Jose, California.Sanrio decided to make Hello Kitty British because foreign countries, including Britain in particular, were trendy in Japan at the time of Hello Kitty's creation. Sanrio already had several characters set in the US, and it wanted Hello Kitty to be different. Shimizu got the name Kitty from Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass; during a scene early in the book, Alice plays with a cat she calls Kitty. Sanrio's motto is \"social communication,\" and Tsuji wanted the brand name to reflect that by including a greeting. He first considered \"Hi Kitty\" before finally settling on \"Hello Kitty,\" her current name.\n\n\n=== Commercial success ===\nHello Kitty sold well immediately after her 1975 launch, and Sanrio's sales increased sevenfold. Due to Japan's growing economy, many Japanese children could afford to buy Hello Kitty products. Her popularity has also been attributed to the emergence of kawaii culture, which embraces cuteness.Originally, Hello Kitty was only marketed towards a child and preteen audience. In the 1990s, the target market for Hello Kitty was broadened to include teenagers and adults as a retro brand. Marketing to those who could not get Hello Kitty merchandise as children, and those who fondly remember items they had, Sanrio began selling Hello Kitty branded products such as purses and laptops. The 1994\u20131996 Face series was the first to be designed specifically for mature consumers.According to Sanrio, Hello Kitty was appearing on 12,000 new products each year as of 1999. By 2008, Hello Kitty was responsible for half of Sanrio's $1 billion net income, and there were over 50,000 different Hello Kitty branded products in more than 60 countries. Beginning in 2007, following trends in Japan, Sanrio began using darker designs for Hello Kitty with more black and less pink and pulled away from kawaii styles.\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\nHello Kitty and Mimi celebrated their 40th anniversary on 1 November 2014. The \"Arigato Everyone Birthday Celebration\" took place in Sanrio Puroland in Tokyo for several days. In Los Angeles, a four-day convention, Hello Kitty Con, was also held in celebration of the anniversary. The convention attracted over 25,000 fans.On 1 January 2020, Sanrio Hello Kitty Town in Iskandar Puteri, Malaysia permanently closed down due to lack of attendance. On 21 February 2020, the Sanrio Puroland theme park (also known as Hello Kitty Land) in Tokyo closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Park officials hoped to have it reopened in early April 2020. In June 2020, Sanrio issued a statement that its founder, Shintaro Tsuji, would retire from his position as Sanrio's chief executive on 1 July 2020, and his grandson, Tomokuni Tsuji, 31, would take over to \"ensure efficient decision making.\"\n\n\n== Design ==\nSpokespeople for Sanrio have confirmed that Hello Kitty has no mouth, as they want people to \"project their feelings onto the character\" and \"be happy or sad together with Hello Kitty.\" Another explanation Sanrio has given for Hello Kitty's lack of a mouth is that she \"speaks from the heart. She's Sanrio's ambassador to the world and isn't bound to any particular language.\" Representatives for Sanrio have said that they see Hello Kitty as a symbol of friendship, which they hope she will foster between people across the world. There has been speculation that Hello Kitty has her origins in Maneki Neko\u2014the name \"Hello Kitty\" is a back-translation of Maneki Neko, meaning \"beckoning cat\" in English. Despite this, no definitive statement supports that speculation.New series involving Hello Kitty with different themed designs are released regularly, following current trends. Yuko Yamaguchi, the main designer for most of Hello Kitty's history, has said that fashion, movies, and TV inspire her in creating new designs.\n\n\n== Products ==\n\nOriginally aimed at the pre-adolescent female market, the Hello Kitty product range has expanded from dolls, stickers, greeting cards, clothes, backpacks, lunch boxes, piggy banks, pencils, erasers, accessories, school supplies and stationery to purses, toasters, televisions, other home appliances, massagers, and computer equipment. These products range from mass market items to high-end consumer products and rare collectibles. As of 2014, more than 50,000 Hello Kitty product lines were available in over 130 countries.\n\n\n=== High-end ===\nSanrio and various corporate partners have released Hello Kitty-branded products, including the Hello Kitty Stratocaster electric guitar (since 2006, with Fender in the US)  and an Airbus A330-200 commercial passenger jet airliner, dubbed the Hello Kitty Jet (2005\u20132009, with EVA Airways in Taiwan). In late 2011 and early 2012, EVA Air revived their \"Hello Kitty Jets\" with their three new A330-300s. However, due to high demand, the airline added two more alongside their existing A330-200s in mid-2012. A year later, EVA Air introduced one of their 777-300ERs as another Hello Kitty Jet, which featured other Sanrio characters as well as Hello Kitty.\nIn 2009, Hello Kitty entered the wine market with a collection of four wines available for purchase online, continuing the expansion of product lines targeted at older audiences.\n\n\n=== Jewelry ===\nIn Spring 2005, Simmons Jewelry Co. and Sanrio announced a partnership. \"Kimora Lee Simmons for Hello Kitty\" was launched exclusively at Neiman Marcus, with prices ranging from $300 to $5000. Designed by Kimora Lee Simmons and launched as the first in a series of collections, the jewelry was hand-made and consisted of diamonds, gemstones, semi-precious stones, 18 karat gold, sterling silver, enamel, and ceramic.In Fall 2008, Simmons Jewelry Co. and Sanrio introduced a collection of fine jewelry and watches named \"Hello Kitty\u00ae by Simmons Jewelry Co.\" The collection launched with Zales Corporation to further expand the reach of the brand, developing accessories for a wide variety of Hello Kitty fans. Meant to attract a youthful audience, the Hello Kitty-themed designs consisted of colorful gemstones set in sterling silver.\n\n\n=== Establishments ===\n\nThere is a themed restaurant named Hello Kitty Sweets in Taipei, Taiwan, which opened in 2008. The restaurant's decor and many of its dishes are patterned after the Hello Kitty characters. Another restaurant called the Hello Kitty Diner opened in the Chatswood area of Sydney, Australia, and a Hello Kitty dim sum restaurant opened in Kowloon, Hong Kong.Hello Kitty caf\u00e9s have opened around the world, including in Seoul and other locations in South Korea; Bangkok, Thailand; Adelaide, Australia; Irvine, California; and the Santa Anita Mall in California.In 2008, a Hello Kitty-themed maternity hospital opened in Yuanlin, Taiwan. Hello Kitty is featured on the receiving blankets, room decor, bed linens, birth certificate covers, and nurses' uniforms. The hospital's owner explained that he hoped that the theme would help ease the stress of childbirth.In 2014, Sanrio partnership with Dufan to introduced Hello Kitty Adventure a cinema based attraction takes guest in journey travelling around the world including many Indonesia Famous Heritage. At the end of the attraction, there is a few photo op that guest can take a picture with many Hello Kitty characters.\nHello Kitty is included as part of the Sanrio livery at the Japanese theme parks Harmonyland and Sanrio Puroland.\n\n\n=== Clothing ===\nIn January 2018, Puma collaborated with Hello Kitty to create the new Puma X Hello Kitty For All Time collection, which features the company's signature sneakers for both children and adults.\n\n\n=== Musical Instruments ===\nIn 2006, Fender partnered with Hello Kitty to create the Hello Kitty Stratocaster under its Squier sub-brand. While initially aimed at pre-teen girls, the Hello Kitty Stratocaster has since been used by famous guitarists including Zakk Wylde, John5, and Slash. The guitar's cult following has caused prices to rise, with second hand guitars going for over \u00a3660 in 2020.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Animated series ===\n\nThere have been several different Hello Kitty TV series. The first animated television series was Hello Kitty's Furry Tale Theater, an anime series that was 13 episodes long and aired in 1987. The next, an OVA titled Hello Kitty and Friends, came out in 1993 and was also 13 episodes long. Hello Kitty's Paradise came out in 1999 and was 16 episodes long. Hello Kitty's Stump Village came out in 2005, and The Adventures of Hello Kitty & Friends came out in 2006 and has aired 52 episodes. A crossover series under the name Kiss Hello Kitty (that paired animated versions of the members of the rock band KISS with Hello Kitty) was announced in March 2013. Produced by Gene Simmons, this show was supposed to air on The Hub Network (now Discovery Family), but it never came to fruition.\nHello Kitty's Paradise was a long-running live-action children's program that aired on TXN from January 1999 to March 2011. It was the longest-running weekly kids' television program in the network's history. In January 2011, the show's creators mutually agreed to end the series after twelve seasons, with the final episode being broadcast on 29 March 2011.\nIn August 2018, Sanrio began streaming a CGI animated series on YouTube. It features Hello Kitty talking to the camera about her life in the style of vlogging YouTubers.Sanrio began streaming the newest 2D animated Hello Kitty series Hello Kitty and Friends Supercute Adventures on YouTube on 26 October 2020.\n\n\n=== Comics ===\nHello Kitty had two manga comics serialized in Ribon, a sh\u014djo manga magazine - Hello Kitty Doki (ran from May 2007 to April 2008) and Hello Kitty Peace (released in June 2008).In March 2016, Sanrio launched a webcomic featuring Hello Kitty as a strawberry-themed superhero called \"Ichigoman\" (ichigo meaning strawberry), who fights monsters with the help of her giant robot. The webcomic is created by Toshiki Inoue and Shakua Sinkai and updates once a month. The Ichigoman alter-ego originates from a 2011 exhibition of Yuko Yamaguchi's artwork.\n\n\n=== Music ===\nHello Kitty has her own branded album, Hello World, featuring Hello Kitty-inspired songs performed by a collection of artists including Keke Palmer, Cori Yarckin, and Ainjel Emme under Hello Kitty's Lakeshore Records record label. Hello Kitty was also chosen by AH Software to be the basis of the new Vocaloid Nekomura Iroha (\u732b\u6751\u3044\u308d\u306f, Nekomura Iroha) to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Sanrio.Hello Kitty was mentioned in the parody song \"Another Tattoo (parody of Nothin' On You by B.o.B and Bruno Mars)\" from \"Weird Al\" Yankovic's 2011 album Alpocalypse.\nCanadian singer-songwriter Avril Lavigne has written and recorded a song called \"Hello Kitty\" for her fifth studio album, Avril Lavigne, released in 2013.\nMusician Yoshiki unveiled the Hello Kitty theme song \"Hello Hello\" in November 2014 at the first Hello Kitty Con. Yoshiki, who was the first celebrity to have his own Hello Kitty doll, \"Yoshikitty,\" was approached by Yamaguchi to compose the song seven years prior. Yoshiki dedicated the anthem to Tsuji Kunihiko, the son of Sanrio founder Shintaro Kunihiko.\n\n\n=== Video games ===\nThere are numerous Hello Kitty games starting with the release of the first title for Famicom in 1992; however, the majority of these games were never released outside of Japan. Hello Kitty also has made cameo appearances in games featuring other Sanrio characters, such as the Keroppi game, Kero Kero Keroppi no B\u014dken Nikki: Nemureru Mori no Keroleen. Special-edition consoles such as the Hello Kitty Dreamcast, Hello Kitty Game Boy Pocket, and Hello Kitty Crystal Xbox have also been released exclusively in Japan.\nHello Kitty appeared as a guest character in Sega's Sonic Dash in 2016, as part of Sega's partnership with Sanrio.

In early 2019, it was revealed that New Line Cinema will be teaming up alongside Sanrio and Flynn Picture Company for an \u201cEnglish language film based on the venerable kid brand.\u201d In 2021, it was reported that Jennifer Coyle and Leo Matsuda have been hired to direct the film with Lindsey Beer set to pen the script.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Hello Kitty brand rose to greater prominence internationally during the late 1990s. At that time, several celebrities, such as Mariah Carey, had adopted Hello Kitty as a fashion statement. Newer products featuring the character can be found in a large variety of American department stores.\nHello Kitty's popularity in Japan peaked in the late 1990s when she was the country's top-grossing character. In 2002, Hello Kitty lost her place as the top-grossing character in Japan in the Character Databank popularity chart. In a 2010 survey, she was in third place behind Anpanman and Pikachu from Pok\u00e9mon. In 2010, The New York Times attributed the character's relative decline in Japan to her biography not being \"compelling enough to draw many fans.\" The newspaper later wrote that analysts called the characterization \"weak,\" and that Hello Kitty not having a mouth has dampened her success as an animated TV character. Hello Kitty has nevertheless remained one of the top three highest-grossing characters in Japan as of 2013.Overseas, her global popularity has increased over the years, with worldwide annual sales reaching $8 billion in 2013. She has been particularly popular in other Asian countries for decades, such as in China, where her cultural impact is comparable to that of Barbie in the Western world. In the United States, she is recognized by more than 80% of young adults in the 18\u201323 age group, as of 2016.\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\nIn May 2008, Japan named Hello Kitty the ambassador of Japanese tourism in both China and Hong Kong (where the character is exceptionally popular among children and young women), marking the first time Japan's tourism ministry had appointed a fictional character to the role. Dr. Sharon Kinsella, a lecturer at Oxford University on Japanese sociology, called the selection of Hello Kitty \"a bit farcical ... as if a dumbed-down cultural icon ... can somehow do something significant to alter the gnarly and difficult state of China-Japan relations.\"UNICEF has also awarded Hello Kitty the exclusive title of UNICEF Special Friend of Children.\n\n\n=== Sales ===\n\n\n=== Controversy ===\nIn July 2008, the Dutch artist Dick Bruna, creator of Miffy, alleged that Hello Kitty is a copy of Miffy (in Dutch: Nijntje), being rendered in a similar style. He stated disapprovingly in an interview for the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph:\n\n'That,' he says darkly, 'is a copy [of Miffy], I think. I don't like that at all. I always think, \"No, don't do that. Try to make something that you think of yourself.\"'Mercis, the firm that managed copyrights for Bruna, took Sanrio to court over their Hello Kitty-associated character Cathy, a rabbit which made her first appearance in 1976 and which Mercis argued infringed the copyright for Miffy. A court in Amsterdam ruled in favour of Mercis in November 2010 and ordered Sanrio to stop the production and sale of merchandise featuring Cathy in the Benelux countries. However, in June 2011, the two companies announced that they had reached a settlement agreement to end their legal dispute. Sanrio stopped using the Cathy character, and the two firms jointly donated \u20ac150,000 for reconstruction after the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami.Musti, a cat character created by Belgian cartoonist Ray Goossens, was also cited as an inspiration for Hello Kitty.\n\n\n== Sculpture ==\nIn 1994, artist Tom Sachs was invited to create a scene for Barneys New York Christmas displays and titled it Hello Kitty Nativity. In the scene, the Virgin Mary was replaced by Madonna with an open Chanel bra, the three Kings were all Bart Simpson, the stable was marked by a McDonald's logo, and the Christ Child was replaced by Hello Kitty. This contemporary revision of the nativity scene demonstrated Sachs' interest in the phenomena of consumerism, branding, and the cultural fetishization of products. Many audiences instead took offense to the artwork, which received backlash from Catholic organizations for its misuse of Christian symbolism.\nIn 2009, Tom Sachs' Bronze Collection was shown at the Public art space in Manhattan's Lever House, as well as in the Baldwin Gallery in Aspen, Colorado, and the Trocad\u00e9ro in Paris. The collection featured white bronze casts of a foam core Hello Kitty sculpture \u2013 a style distinctive to the artist. As of April 2010, the Wind-Up Hello Kitty sculpture is still on display at Lever House.  Although Sachs did not seek permission to use the character in his work, a brand marketing manager for Sanrio was quoted as saying \"You know, there was Marilyn Monroe and Andy Warhol, and then Michael Jackson and Jeff Koons. When you're an icon, that's what happens.\"In 2015, a 9-foot tall pearlescent Hello Kitty sculpture by artist Sebastian Masuda was exhibited at the Dag Hammarskjold Plaza in New York City, as part of the Japan Society's exhibition: Life of Cats: Selections from the Hiraki Ukiyo-e Collection.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Japan portal\n Anime and manga portal\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Hello Kitty website\nHello Kitty at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

Sanrio depicts Hello Kitty as a young female gijinka (anthropomorphization) of a Japanese Bobtail cat with a red bow and no mouth. According to her backstory, she is a perpetual 3rd-grade student who lives outside of London. Kitty and her twin sister, Mimi, celebrate their birthday on 1 November 1974. Since the cartoon character's creation, the Hello Kitty media franchise has grown to include clothing, accessories, toys, games, books, manga, anime series, and music albums, along with other various product lines and media productions.\nShortly after Hello Kitty's creation in 1974, the Hello Kitty vinyl coin purse was introduced by Sanrio in March 1975. Sanrio brought the character to the United States in 1976. By 2010, Sanrio had turned Hello Kitty into a global marketing phenomenon, worth $6 billion a year. By 2014, when Hello Kitty was 40 years old, she was worth about $8 billion a year. Hello Kitty has become one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.\nHello Kitty is a staple of the kawaii segment of Japanese popular culture. First marketed toward pre-teenage girls, Hello Kitty's image found commercial success among not only her original target audience but adolescent and adult consumers as well. A variety of products ranging from school supplies to fashion accessories to motor oil have featured the character over the years. A number of Hello Kitty TV series targeted towards children have been produced, as well as several manga comics and anime films. There are Sanrio theme parks based on Hello Kitty: Harmonyland in Hiji, \u014cita, Japan; Sanrio Puroland in Tama New Town, Tokyo, Japan; and the former Sanrio Hello Kitty Town in Iskandar Puteri, Johor, Malaysia."}, "Hepburn_romanization": {"links": ["StwoCID ", "Tokyo Metropolitan Government", "Kenky\u016bsha", "Ch\u014donpu", "Tokunoshima language", "Akita dialect", "Japanese pronouns", "Scarecrow Press", "Kana", "JIS X two oh-one", "Japanese numerals", "Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary", "James Marshall Unger", "Japanese sound symbolism", "Tokyo dialect", "Kodansha", "Yokohama Pidgin Japanese", "Circumflex accent", "Japanese language", "Japanese adjectives", "Gairaigo", "Historical kana usage", "Sokuon", "Early Middle Japanese", "Kan-on", "Pseudo-Chinese", "John Benjamins Publishing Company", "Ny\u014db\u014d kotoba", "Kudzu", "Library of Congress", "Southern Ryukyuan languages", "Gemination", "The Japan Times", "Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers", "Yoron language", "Japanese books", "Katakana", "S\u014dgana", "Stroke order", "Yaeyama language", "Japanese pitch accent", "Yamato kotoba", "ARIB STD Btwenty-four character set", "Kikai language", "JIS X two eleven", "Okinawan language", "Transcription into Japanese", "Ch\u016bgoku dialect", "Kagoshima dialect", "Cabinet of Japan", "Kyowa-go", "Okinawan Japanese", "Modern kana usage", "Rendaku", "List of kanji by stroke count", "Kanji", "Hy\u014dgai kanji", "Japanese phonology", "Syllabary", "Tsushima dialect", "Logogram", "Okurigana", "Latin script", "Katakana ", "Bonin English", "Japanese possessives", "Nagaoka dialect", "Japanese counter word", "Kunrei-shiki romanization", "Mikawa dialect", "Hakata dialect", "Tosa dialect", "Amami \u014cshima language", "Occupation of Japan", "Romance language", "Umpaku dialect", "James Curtis Hepburn", "H\u014dnichi dialect", "Iyo dialect", "Minerva", "Phoneme", "Kanbun", "Table of Japanese kanji radicals", "Okinoerabu language", "JSL romanization", "Extended Unix Code", "BSI Group", "Enclosed CJK Letters and Months", "Japanese dictionary", "Yamagata dialect", "Yilan Creole Japanese", "Halfwidth and fullwidth forms", "Matcha", "Japonic languages", "Awaji dialect", "Kana ligature", "Topic marker", "Japanese particles", "Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology", "Kokufu Station", "Hachij\u014d language", "Douglas MacArthur", "List of Japanese speculative fiction writers", "JIS X two oh-eight", "Japanese literature", "ISO/IEC twenty twenty-two", "Japanese punctuation", "Historical kana orthography", "Iteration mark", "T\u014dhoku dialect", "Goj\u016bon", "Hachij\u014d grammar", "Go-on", "Presbyterian Mission Agency", "Japanese orthographic issues", "Furigana", "Macron ", "Hichiku dialect", "Miyakoan language", "Polivanov system", "Yakuwarigo", "ALA-LC romanization", "Japanese grammar", "\u014cita dialect", "Kana Supplement", "Enclosed Ideographic Supplement", "Gender differences in Japanese", "Ateji", "Hokuriku dialect", "Japanese Braille", "Orthography", "Phonology", "Japanese poetry", "Saga dialect", "Labial consonant", "List of classical Japanese texts", "JIS X two twelve", "Shift JIS", "Early Modern Japanese", "Romanization of Japanese", "Glossary of Japanese words of Portuguese origin", "Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport ", "Honorific speech in Japanese", "Niigata ", "Ministry of Foreign Affairs ", "Ky\u014diku kanji", "Man'y\u014dgana", "Gunma", "Kanazukai", "List of Japanese typographic symbols", "Yedo", "American National Standards Institute", "J\u014dy\u014d kanji", "Morpheme", "Sino-Japanese vocabulary", "Japanese loanwords in Hawaii", "Old Japanese", "Ministry of International Trade and Industry", "Harold E.

Originally published in 1867 by American missionary James Curtis Hepburn as the standard in the first edition of his Japanese\u2013English dictionary, the system is distinct from other romanization methods in its use of English orthography to phonetically transcribe sounds: for example, the syllable [\u0255i] is written as shi and [t\u0255a] is written as cha, reflecting their spellings in English (compare to si and tya in the more-systematic Nihon-shiki and Kunrei-shiki systems).\nIn 1886, Hepburn published the third edition of his dictionary, codifying a revised version of the system that is known today as \"traditional Hepburn\". A version with additional revisions, known as \"modified Hepburn\", was published in 1908.\nAlthough Kunrei-shiki romanization is the style favored by the Japanese government, Hepburn remains the most popular method of Japanese romanization. It is learned by most foreign students of the language, and is used within Japan for romanizing personal names, locations, and other information, such as train tables and road signs. Because the system's orthography is based on English phonology instead of a systematic transcription of the Japanese syllabary, individuals who only speak English or a Romance language will generally be more accurate when pronouncing unfamiliar words romanized in the Hepburn style compared to other systems.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1867, American Presbyterian missionary doctor James Curtis Hepburn published the first Japanese\u2013English dictionary, in which he introduced a new system for the romanization of Japanese into Latin script. He published a second edition in 1872 and a third edition in 1886, which introduced minor changes. The third edition's system had been adopted in the previous year by the R\u014dmaji-kai (\u7f85\u99ac\u5b57\u4f1a, \"Romanization Club\"), a group of Japanese and foreign scholars who promoted a replacement of the Japanese script with a romanized system.Hepburn romanization, loosely based on the conventions of English orthography (spelling), stood in opposition to Nihon-shiki romanization, which had been developed in Japan in 1881 as a script replacement. Compared to Hepburn, Nihon-shiki is more systematic in its representation of the Japanese syllabary (kana), as each symbol corresponds to a phoneme. However, the notation requires further explanation for accurate pronunciation by non-Japanese speakers: for example, the syllables [\u0255i] and [t\u0255a], which are written as shi and cha in Hepburn, are rendered as si and tya in Nihon-shiki. After Nihon-shiki was presented to the R\u014dmaji-kai in 1886, a dispute began between the supporters of the two systems, which resulted in a standstill and an eventual halt to the organization's activities in 1892.After the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u201305), the two factions resurfaced as the Romaji Hirome-kai (\u30ed\u30fc\u30de\u5b57\u3072\u308d\u3081\u4f1a, \"Society for the Spread of Romanization\"), which supported Hepburn's style, and the Nihon no Romaji-sha (\u65e5\u672c\u306e\u30ed\u30fc\u30de\u5b57\u793e, \"Romanization Society of Japan\"), which supported Nihon-shiki. In 1908, Hepburn was revised by educator Kan\u014d Jigor\u014d and others of the Romaji Hirome-kai, which began calling it the Sh\u016bsei Hebon-shiki (\u4fee\u6b63\u30d8\u30dc\u30f3\u5f0f, \"modified Hepburn system\") or Hy\u014djun-shiki (\u6a19\u6e96\u5f0f, \"standard system\").In 1930, a Special Romanization Study Commission, headed by the Minister of Education, was appointed by the government to devise a standardized form of romanization. The Commission eventually decided on a slightly modified \"compromise\" version of Nihon-shiki, which was chosen for official use by cabinet ordinance on September 21, 1937; this system is known today as Kunrei-shiki romanization. On September 3, 1945, at the beginning of the occupation of Japan after World War II, Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers Douglas MacArthur issued a directive mandating the use of modified Hepburn by occupation forces. The directive had no legal force, however, and a revised version of Kunrei-shiki was reissued by cabinet ordinance on December 9, 1954, after the end of occupation.Although it lacks de jure status, Hepburn remains the de facto standard for some applications in Japan. As of 1977, many government organizations used Hepburn, including the Ministry of International Trade and Industry; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requires the use of Hepburn on passports, and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport requires its use on transport signs, including road signs and railway station signs. Hepburn is also used by private organizations, including The Japan Times and the Japan Travel Bureau.American National Standard System for the Romanization of Japanese (ANSI Z39.11-1972), based on modified Hepburn, was approved in 1971 and published in 1972 by the American National Standards Institute. In 1989, it was proposed for International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 3602, but was rejected in favor of Kunrei-shiki. ANSI Z39.11-1972 was deprecated as a standard in 1994.\n\n\n== Variants ==\n\nThere are many variants of the Hepburn romanization. The two most common styles are as follows:\n\nTraditional Hepburn, as defined in various editions of Hepburn's dictionary, with the third edition (1886) often considered authoritative (although changes in kana usage must be accounted for). It is characterized by the rendering of syllabic n as m before the consonants b, m and p: for example, Shimbashi for \u65b0\u6a4b.\nModified Hepburn, also known as Revised Hepburn, in which (among other changes) the rendering of syllabic n as m before certain consonants is no longer used: Shinbashi for \u65b0\u6a4b. The version of the system published in the third (1954) and later editions of Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary are often considered authoritative; it was adopted in 1989 by the Library of Congress as one of its ALA-LC romanizations, and is the most common variant of Hepburn romanization used today.In Japan itself, there are some variants officially mandated for various uses:\n\nRailway Standard (\u9244\u9053\u63b2\u793a\u57fa\u6e96\u898f\u7a0b, Tetsud\u014d Keiji Kijun Kitei), which mostly follows Modified Hepburn, except syllabic n is rendered as in Traditional. Japan Railways and other major railways use it for station names.\nMinistry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism Standard,\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs Passport Standard (\u5916\u52d9\u7701\u65c5\u5238\u898f\u5b9a, Gaimush\u014d Ryoken Kitei), a permissive standard, which explicitly allows the use of \"non-Hepburn romaji\" (\u975e\u30d8\u30dc\u30f3\u5f0f\u30ed\u30fc\u30de\u5b57, hi-Hebon-shiki r\u014dmaji) in personal names, notably for passports. In particular, it renders the syllabic n as m before b, m and p, and romanizes the long vowel \u014d as oh, oo or ou (Satoh, Satoo or Satou for \u4f50\u85e4).Details of the variants can be found below.\n\n\n=== Obsolete variants ===\nThe romanizations set out in the first and second versions of Hepburn's dictionary are primarily of historical interest. Notable differences from the third and later versions include:\n\n\n== Features ==\nThe main feature of Hepburn is that its orthography is based on English phonology. More technically, when syllables that are constructed systematically according to the Japanese syllabary contain an \"unstable\" consonant in the modern spoken language, the orthography is changed to something that better matches the real sound as an English-speaker would pronounce it. For example, \u3057 is written shi not si. This transcription is thus only partly phonological.\nSome linguists such as Harold E. Palmer, Daniel Jones and Otto Jespersen object to Hepburn since the pronunciation-based spellings can obscure the systematic origins of Japanese phonetic structures, inflections, and conjugations. Supporters of Hepburn argue that it is not intended as a linguistic tool, and that individuals who only speak English or a Romance language will generally be more accurate when pronouncing unfamiliar words romanized in the Hepburn style compared to other systems.\n\n\n=== Long vowels ===\nIn Hepburn, vowel combinations that form a long sound are usually indicated with a macron ( \u00af ). Other adjacent vowels, such as those separated by a morpheme boundary, are written separately:\n\nAll other vowel combinations are always written separately:\n\nE + I: \u5236 (\u305b\u3044)\u670d (\u3075\u304f) \u2013 sei + fuku \u2013 seifuku 'uniform'\nU + I: \u8efd (\u304b\u308b)\u3044 \u2013 karu + i \u2013 karui 'light (in weight)'\nO + I: \u7525 (\u304a\u3044) \u2013 oi \u2013 oi 'nephew'\n\n\n==== Loanwords ====\nIn foreign loanwords, long vowels followed by a ch\u014donpu (\u30fc) are indicated with macrons:\n\n\u30bb\u30fc\u30e9\u30fc: se + (\u30fc) + ra + (\u30fc) = s\u0113r\u0101 'sailor'\n\u30bf\u30af\u30b7\u30fc: ta + ku + shi + (\u30fc) = takush\u012b 'taxi'\n\u30b3\u30f3\u30af\u30fc\u30eb: ko + n + ku + (\u30fc) + ru = konk\u016bru 'competition'\n\u30d0\u30ec\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb: ba + re + (\u30fc) + bo + (\u30fc) + ru = bar\u0113b\u014dru 'volleyball'\n\u30bd\u30fc\u30eb: so + (\u30fc) + ru = s\u014dru 'sole (of a shoe, etc.)'Adjacent vowels in loanwords are written separately:\n\n\u30d0\u30ec\u30a8: ba + re + e \u2013 baree 'ballet'\n\u30df\u30a4\u30e9: mi + i + ra \u2013 miira 'mummy'\n\u30bd\u30a6\u30eb: so + u + ru \u2013 souru 'soul', 'Seoul'\n\n\n==== Variations ====\nThere are many variations on the Hepburn system for indicating long vowels with a macron. For example, \u6771\u4eac (\u3068\u3046\u304d\u3087\u3046) is properly romanized as T\u014dky\u014d, but can also be written as:\n\nTokyo \u2013 not indicated at all. Common for Japanese words that have been adopted into English, and the de facto convention for Hepburn used in signs and other English-language information around Japan.\nT\u00f4ky\u00f4 \u2013 indicated with circumflex accents, as in the alternative Nihon-shiki and Kunrei-shiki romanizations. They are often used when macrons are unavailable or difficult to input, due to their visual similarity.\nTohkyoh \u2013 indicated with an h (only applies after o). This is sometimes known as \"passport Hepburn\", as the Japanese Foreign Ministry has authorized (but not required) it in passports.\nToukyou \u2013 written using kana spelling: \u014d as ou or oo (depending on the kana). This is also known as w\u0101puro style, as it reflects how text is entered into a Japanese word processor by using a keyboard with Roman characters. W\u0101puro more accurately represents the way that \u014d is written in kana by differentiating between \u304a\u3046 (as in \u3068\u3046\u304d\u3087\u3046 (\u6771\u4eac), Toukyou in w\u0101puro) and \u304a\u304a (as in \u3068\u304a\u3044 (\u9060\u3044), tooi in w\u0101puro); however, it fails to differentiate between long vowels and vowels separated by a morpheme boundary.\nTookyoo \u2013 written by doubling the long vowels. Some dictionaries such as the Pocket Kenkyusha Japanese Dictionary and Basic English Writers' Japanese-English Wordbook follow this style, and it is also used in the JSL form of romanization.\n\n\n=== Particles ===\nIn traditional and modified:\n\nWhen \u306f is used as a particle, it is written wa.In traditional Hepburn:\n\nWhen \u3078 is used as a particle, Hepburn originally recommended ye. This spelling is obsolete, and it is commonly written as e (Romaji-Hirome-Kai, 1974).\nWhen \u3092 is used as a particle, it is written wo.In modified Hepburn:\nWhen \u3078 is used as a particle, it is written e.\nWhen \u3092 is used as a particle, it is written o.\n\n\n=== Syllabic n ===\nIn traditional Hepburn:\nSyllabic n (\u3093) is written as n before consonants, but as m before labial consonants: b, m, and p. It is sometimes written as n- (with a hyphen) before vowels and y (to avoid confusion between, for example, \u3093\u3042 n + a and \u306a na, and \u3093\u3084 n + ya and \u306b\u3083 nya), but its hyphen usage is not clear.\u6848\u5185\uff08\u3042\u3093\u306a\u3044\uff09: annai \u2013 guide\n\u7fa4\u99ac\uff08\u3050\u3093\u307e\uff09: Gumma \u2013 Gunma\n\u7c21\u6613\uff08\u304b\u3093\u3044\uff09: kan-i \u2013 simple\n\u4fe1\u7528\uff08\u3057\u3093\u3088\u3046\uff09: shin-y\u014d \u2013 trustIn modified Hepburn:\nThe rendering m before labial consonants is not used and is replaced with n. It is written n' (with an apostrophe) before vowels and y.\u6848\u5185\uff08\u3042\u3093\u306a\u3044\uff09: annai \u2013 guide\n\u7fa4\u99ac\uff08\u3050\u3093\u307e\uff09: Gunma \u2013 Gunma\n\u7c21\u6613\uff08\u304b\u3093\u3044\uff09: kan'i \u2013 simple\n\u4fe1\u7528\uff08\u3057\u3093\u3088\u3046\uff09: shin'y\u014d \u2013 trust\n\n\n=== Long consonants ===\nElongated (or \"geminate\") consonant sounds are marked by doubling the consonant following a sokuon, \u3063; for consonants that are digraphs in Hepburn (sh, ch, ts), only the first consonant of the set is doubled, except for ch, which is replaced by tch.\n\u7d50\u679c\uff08\u3051\u3063\u304b\uff09: kekka \u2013 result\n\u3055\u3063\u3055\u3068: sassato \u2013 quickly\n\u305a\u3063\u3068: zutto \u2013 all the time\n\u5207\u7b26\uff08\u304d\u3063\u3077\uff09: kippu \u2013 ticket\n\u96d1\u8a8c\uff08\u3056\u3063\u3057\uff09: zasshi \u2013 magazine\n\u4e00\u7dd2\uff08\u3044\u3063\u3057\u3087\uff09: issho \u2013 together\n\u3053\u3063\u3061: kotchi (not kocchi) \u2013 this way\n\u62b9\u8336\uff08\u307e\u3063\u3061\u3083\uff09: matcha (not maccha) \u2013 matcha\n\u4e09\u3064\uff08\u307f\u3063\u3064\uff09: mittsu \u2013 three\n\n\n== Romanization charts ==\nEach entry contains hiragana, katakana, and Hepburn romanization, in that order.\n\u2020 \u2014 The characters in red are rare historical characters and are obsolete in modern Japanese. In modern Hepburn romanization, they are often undefined.\n\u2021 \u2014 The characters in blue are rarely used outside of their status as a particle in modern Japanese, and romanization follows the rules above.\n\n\n=== Extended katakana ===\nThese combinations are used mainly to represent the sounds in words in other languages.\nDigraphs with orange backgrounds are the general ones used for loanwords or foreign places or names, and those with blue backgrounds are used for more accurate transliterations of foreign sounds, both suggested by the Cabinet of Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. Katakana combinations with beige backgrounds are suggested by the American National Standards Institute and the British Standards Institution as possible uses. Ones with purple backgrounds appear on the 1974 version of the Hy\u014djun-shiki formatting.\n* \u2014 The use of \u30a6 in these two cases to represent w is rare in modern Japanese except for Internet slang and transcription of the Latin sound [w] into katakana. E.g.: \u30df\u30cd\u30eb\u30a6\u30a1 (Mineruwa \"Minerva\", from Latin MINERVA [m\u026a\u02c8n\u025brwa]); \u30a6\u30a5\u30eb\u30ab\u30fc\u30cc\u30b9 (Wuruk\u0101nusu \"Vulcan\", from Latin VVLCANVS, Vulc\u0101nus [w\u028al\u02c8ka\u02d0n\u028as]). The wa-type of foreign sounds (as in watt or white) is usually transcribed to \u30ef (wa), while the wu-type (as in wood or woman) is usually to \u30a6 (u) or \u30a6\u30fc (\u016b).\n\u2051 \u2014 \u30f4 has a rarely-used hiragana form in \u3094 that is also vu in Hepburn romanization systems.\n\u2042 \u2014 The characters in green are obsolete in modern Japanese and very rarely used.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nList of ISO romanizations\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nPreface of first edition of Hepburn's original dictionary, explaining romanization\nPreface of third edition of Hepburn's original dictionary, explaining romanization", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Globe_of_letters.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/James_Curtis_Hepburn.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Toyooka_Station_Sign_%28cropped%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/%E6%9B%B8.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9e/Flag_of_Japan.svg"], "summary": "Hepburn romanization (Japanese: \u30d8\u30dc\u30f3\u5f0f\u30ed\u30fc\u30de\u5b57, Hepburn: Hebon-shiki r\u014dmaji) is the most widely-used system of romanization for the Japanese language. Originally published in 1867 by American missionary James Curtis Hepburn as the standard in the first edition of his Japanese\u2013English dictionary, the system is distinct from other romanization methods in its use of English orthography to phonetically transcribe sounds: for example, the syllable [\u0255i] is written as shi and [t\u0255a] is written as cha, reflecting their spellings in English (compare to si and tya in the more-systematic Nihon-shiki and Kunrei-shiki systems).\nIn 1886, Hepburn published the third edition of his dictionary, codifying a revised version of the system that is known today as \"traditional Hepburn\". A version with additional revisions, known as \"modified Hepburn\", was published in 1908.\nAlthough Kunrei-shiki romanization is the style favored by the Japanese government, Hepburn remains the most popular method of Japanese romanization. It is learned by most foreign students of the language, and is used within Japan for romanizing personal names, locations, and other information, such as train tables and road signs. Because the system's orthography is based on English phonology instead of a systematic transcription of the Japanese syllabary, individuals who only speak English or a Romance language will generally be more accurate when pronouncing unfamiliar words romanized in the Hepburn style compared to other systems."}, "Nagaoka_dialect": {"links": ["Hichiku dialect", "Halfwidth and fullwidth forms", "Early Modern Japanese", "Japanese punctuation", "Japanese irregular verbs", "Yoron language", "Katakana ", "List of kanji by concept", "Kesen dialect", "Hachij\u014d language", "List of Japanese writers", "Saga dialect", "Glossary of Japanese words of Dutch origin", "Polivanov system", "Amami Japanese", "Japanese writing system", "Shift JIS", "Hentaigana", "J\u014ddai Tokushu Kanazukai", "Extended Unix Code", "Go-on", "List of Japanese speculative fiction writers", "Ryukyuan languages", "Itoigawa, Niigata", "Kana", "Engrish", "Mikawa dialect", "Hachij\u014d grammar", "Niigata prefecture", "List of kanji radicals by frequency", "Japanese grammar", "Bamboo English", "H\u014dnichi dialect", "Japanese books", "JIS X two eleven", "Early Middle Japanese", "Awaji dialect", "Mino dialect", "Transcription into Japanese", "Okinawan language", "Tokunoshima language", "Yaeyama language", "Pseudo-Chinese", "JIS X two twelve", "Japanese counter word", "Topic marker", "Yokohama Pidgin Japanese", "Hokuriku dialect", "T\u014d-on", "Yilan Creole Japanese", "Yonaguni language", "Gender differences in Japanese", "Ateji", "Japanese literature", "Wasei-eigo", "Japanese pronouns", "Kanji", "ISO six thirty-nine-3", "Japanese language", "List of kanji radicals by stroke count", "Japanese adjectives", "Kant\u014d dialect", "Modern kana usage", "Bansh\u016b dialect", "Akita dialect", "Japanese sound symbolism", "Katakana Phonetic Extensions", "Yamagata dialect", "Yotsugana", "Japan", "Southern Ryukyuan languages", "Ch\u016bgoku dialect", "Niigata Prefecture", "Tsugaru dialect", "Amami \u014cshima language", "Kyowa-go", "Enclosed Ideographic Supplement", "Kana Extended-A", "Kana Supplement", "Okinawan Japanese", "Old Japanese", "JIS X two thirteen", "T\u014dhoku dialect", "Lexical category", "Kan-on", "Japanese numerals", "Kansai dialect", "Kunigami language", "Bonin English", "Okinoerabu language", "List of kanji by stroke count", "Japonic languages", "Yamato kotoba", "Kanazukai", "Shikoku dialect", "Japanese phonology", "Umpaku dialect", "Ryakuji", "Ibaraki dialect", "Kana ligature", "Hida dialect", "Nagoya dialect", "Yakuwarigo", "Japanese pitch accent", "Japanese possessives", "Kagoshima dialect", "Miyakoan language", "Nagaoka, Niigata", "Gairaigo", "Tokyo dialect", "Logogram", "Enclosed CJK Letters and Months", "Kunrei-shiki romanization", "T\u014dkai\u2013T\u014dsan", "Braille kanji", "JSL romanization", "Ny\u014db\u014d kotoba", "Romanization of Japanese", "JIS X two oh-one", "Niigata dialect", "Rendaku", "S\u014dgana", "Transcription of the Japanese language in Esperanto", "Goj\u016bon", "Hiragana", "Nihon-shiki romanization", "Hokkaido dialects", "Extended shinjitai", "Late Middle Japanese", "Glossary of Japanese words of Portuguese origin", "Tosa dialect", "T\u014dkai\u2013T\u014dsan dialect", "Hiragana ", "Hakata dialect", "Honorific speech in Japanese", "W\u0101puro r\u014dmaji", "Japanese loanwords in Hawaii", "\u014cita dialect", "Eastern Japanese", "English language", "Japanese poetry", "Auxiliary verbs", "Ch\u016betsu region", "Tsushima dialect", "Japanese honorifics", "ISO 6three9-three", "JIS X two oh-eight", "Historical kana orthography", "Japanese dictionary", "Japanese godan and ichidan verbs", "Man'y\u014dgana", "Wasei-kango", "Sino-Japanese vocabulary", "Cyrillization of Japanese", "Hepburn romanization", "Japanese dialects", "Language family", "Iyo dialect", "ARIB STD Btwenty-four character set", "Glottolog", "Japanese verb conjugation", "Katakana", "List of classical Japanese texts", "Okurigana", "ISO/IEC twenty twenty-two", "Kanbun", "Japanese particles", "Small Kana Extension", "Japanese orthographic issues", "Kikai language", "Sanuki dialect", "Northern Ryukyuan languages", "Furigana", "Classical Japanese", "Japanese Braille"], "content": "Nagaoka dialect is a dialect of the Japanese language spoken in Ch\u016betsu region centered Nagaoka city in Niigata prefecture of Japan. Nagaoka dialect is similar to Niigata dialect spoken in the Southern Kaetsu region. It differs somewhat from town to town.\n\n\n== Accent ==\nThe accent of the Nagaoka dialect is classified as being among the outer range of the Tokyo accent group. With the development of modern media and transportation in recent years, there has been a trend, mostly among younger people, to use the middle range of the Tokyo accent group, which was originally used only in Itoigawa. For example, two-syllable words originally having a heiban accent, meaning a word ending with a high pitch that carries over to the following particle, have changed to an odaka accent, meaning the high pitch no longer carries over to the particle.\nSome additional difference from the standard Tokyo dialect:\n\n\n== Grammar ==\n\n\n=== ga ===\nThe postposition ga is probably the best known element of the Nagaoka dialect. It is typically placed at the end of sentences to alter the speaker's tone. It is basically equivalent to (no da) yo or no in standard Japanese. It is often pronounced with a lengthened vowel sound, i.e. g\u0101, written in Japanese as \u304c\u30fc or \u304c\u3041.\nFeatures of ga:\n\nWhen spoken with rising intonation it can often indicate a question, while falling intonation often shows the speaker's understanding or concent.\nUnlike regular postpositions, additional postpositions can be added after ga, such as ka, ya and te.\nThe copula da/desu and the polite form -masu can be abbreviated when ga is added, e.g. \"This is Nagaoka.\" which would be rendered in standard Japanese as Koko wa Nagaoka na n da (\u3053\u3053\u306f\u9577\u5ca1\u306a\u3093\u3060) would be Koko wa Nagaoka n ga (\u3053\u3053\u306f\u9577\u5ca1\u3093\u304c) (Note that na has also been lost). Other auxiliary verbs are not removed.\n\n\n=== te ===\nLike ga, te is generally attached to the end of a sentence, and carries a meaning similar to (da) yo in standard Japanese. Unlike ga, however, da, desu and -masu are not removed when te is added, e.g. \"This is Nagaoka\", rendered in standard Japanese as Koko wa Nagaoka da yo (\u3053\u3053\u306f\u9577\u5ca1\u3060\u3088) would be Koko wa Nagaoka da te (\u3053\u3053\u306f\u9577\u5ca1\u3060\u3066) in Nagaoka dialect.\n\n\n=== ra ===\nThe copula da and its derivative dar\u014d are replaced with ra and raro, e.g. standard Japanese S\u014d dar\u014d? (\u305d\u3046\u3060\u308d\u3046\uff1f) becomes S\u014d raro? (\u305d\u3046\u3089\u308d\uff1f) in Nagaoka dialect.\n\n\n== Vocabulary ==\nBelow is a list of example words from the Nagaoka dialect:\n\n\n== References ==", "images": [], "summary": "Nagaoka dialect is a dialect of the Japanese language spoken in Ch\u016betsu region centered Nagaoka city in Niigata prefecture of Japan.

variable-width encodings with a character belonging an ISO/IEC 646 compliant coded character set (such as ASCII) taking one byte, and a character belonging to a 94x94 coded character set (such as GB 2312) represented in two bytes. The EUC-CN form of GB 2312 and EUC-KR are examples of such two-byte EUC codes. EUC-JP includes characters represented by up to three bytes, including an initial shift code, whereas a single character in EUC-TW can take up to four bytes.\nModern applications are more likely to use UTF-8, which supports all of the glyphs of the EUC codes, and more, and is generally more portable with fewer vendor deviations and errors. EUC is however still very popular, especially EUC-KR for South Korea.\n\n\n== Encoding structure ==\n\nThe structure of EUC is based on the ISO/IEC 2022 standard, which specifies a system of graphical character sets which can be represented with a sequence of the 94 7-bit bytes 0x21\u20137E, or alternatively 0xA1\u2013FE if an eighth bit is available. This allows for sets of 94 graphical characters, or 8836 (942) characters, or 830584 (943) characters. Although initially 0x20 and 0x7F were always the space and delete character and 0xA0 and 0xFF were unused, later editions of ISO/IEC 2022 allowed the use of the bytes 0xA0 and 0xFF (or 0x20 and 0x7F) within sets under certain circumstances, allowing the inclusion of 96-character sets. The ranges 0x00\u20131F and 0x80\u20139F are used for C0 and C1 control codes.\nEUC is a family of 8-bit profiles of ISO/IEC 2022, as opposed to 7-bit profiles such as ISO-2022-JP. As such, only ISO 2022 compliant character sets can have EUC forms. Up to four coded character sets (referred to as G0, G1, G2, and G3 or as code sets 0, 1, 2, and 3) can be represented with the EUC scheme. The G0 set is set to an ISO/IEC 646 compliant coded character set such as US-ASCII, ISO 646:KR (KS X 1003) or ISO 646:JP (the lower half of JIS X 0201) and invoked over GL (i.e. 0x21\u20130x7E, with the most significant bit cleared). If US-ASCII is used, this makes the code an extended ASCII encoding; the most common deviation from US-ASCII is that 0x5C (backslash in US-ASCII) is often used to represent a Yen sign in EUC-JP (see below) and a won sign in EUC-KR.\nThe other code sets are invoked over GR (i.e. with the most significant bit set). Hence, to get the EUC form of a character, the most significant bit of each coding byte is set (equivalent to adding 128 to each 7-bit coding byte, or adding 160 to each number in the kuten code); this allows software to easily distinguish whether a particular byte in a character string belongs to the ISO 646 code or the extended code. Characters in code sets 2 and 3 are prefixed with the control codes SS2 (0x8E) and SS3 (0x8F) respectively, and invoked over GR. Besides the initial shift code, any byte outside of the range 0xA0\u20130xFF appearing in a character from code sets 1 through 3 is not a valid EUC code.The EUC code itself does not make use of the announcement and designation sequences from ISO 2022. However, the code specification is equivalent to the following sequence of four ISO 2022 announcement sequences, with meanings breaking down as follows.\n\n\n=== Fixed-width format ===\nThe ISO-2022-based variable-width encoding described above is sometimes referred to as the EUC packed format, which is the encoding format usually labelled as EUC. However, internal processing of EUC data may make use of a fixed-width transformation format called the EUC complete two-byte format. This represents:\nCode set 0 as two bytes in the range 0x21\u20130x7E (except that the first may be 0x00).\nCode set 1 as two bytes in the range 0xA0\u20130xFF (except that the first may be 0x80).\nCode set 2 as a byte in the range 0x20\u20130x7E (or 0x00) followed by a byte in the range 0xA0\u20130xFF.\nCode set 3 as a byte in the range 0xA0\u20130xFF (or 0x80) followed by a byte in the range 0x21\u20130x7E.Initial bytes of 0x00 and 0x80 are used in cases where the code set uses only one byte. There is also a four-byte fixed-length format. These fixed-length encoding formats are suited to internal processing and are not usually encountered in interchange.\nEUC-JP is registered with the IANA in both formats, the packed format as \"EUC-JP\" or \"csEUCPkdFmtJapanese\" and the fixed width format as \"csEUCFixWidJapanese\". Only the packed format is included in the WHATWG Encoding Standard used by HTML5.\n\n\n== EUC-CN ==\nEUC-CN is the usual encoded form of the GB 2312 standard for simplified Chinese characters. Unlike the case of Japanese JIS X 0208 and ISO-2022-JP, GB 2312 is not normally used in a 7-bit ISO 2022 code version, although a variant form called HZ (which delimits GB 2312 text with ASCII sequences) was sometimes used on USENET.\nAn ASCII character is represented in its usual encoding. A character from GB 2312 is represented by two bytes, both from the range 0xA1\u20130xFE.\n\n\n=== Related Mainland Chinese encoding systems ===\n\n\n==== 748 code ====\nAn encoding related to EUC-CN is the \"748\" code used in the WITS typesetting system developed by Beijing's Founder Technology (now obsoleted by its newer FITS typesetting system). The 748 code contains all of GB 2312, but is not ISO 2022\u2013compliant and therefore not a true EUC code. (It uses an 8-bit lead byte but distinguishes between a second byte with its most significant bit set and one with its most significant bit cleared, and is therefore more similar in structure to Big5 and other non\u2013ISO 2022\u2013compliant DBCS encoding systems.) The non-GB2312 portion of the 748 code contains traditional and Hong Kong characters and other glyphs used in newspaper typesetting.\n\n\n==== GBK and GB 18030 ====\n\nGBK is an extension to GB 2312. It defines an extended form of the EUC-CN encoding capable of representing a larger array of CJK characters sourced largely from Unicode 1.1, including traditional Chinese characters and characters used only in Japanese. It is not, however, a true EUC code, because ASCII bytes may appear as trail bytes (and C1 bytes, not limited to the single shifts, may appear as lead or trail bytes), due to a larger encoding space being required.\nVariants of GBK are implemented by Windows code page 936 (the Microsoft Windows code page for simplified Chinese), and by IBM's code page 1386.\nThe Unicode-based GB 18030 character encoding defines an extension of GBK capable of encoding the entirety of Unicode. However, Unicode encoded as GB 18030 is a variable-width encoding which may use up to four bytes per character, due to an even larger encoding space being required. Being an extension of GBK, it is a superset of EUC-CN but is not itself a true EUC code. Being a Unicode encoding, its repertoire is identical to that of other Unicode transformation formats such as UTF-8.\n\n\n==== Mac OS Chinese Simplified ====\nOther EUC-CN variants deviating from the EUC mechanism include the Mac OS Chinese Simplified script (known as Code page 10008 or x-mac-chinesesimp). It uses the bytes 0x80, 0x81, 0x82, 0xA0, 0xFD, 0xFE and 0xFF for the U with umlaut (\u00fc), two special font metric characters, the non-breaking space, the copyright sign (\u00a9), the trademark sign (\u2122) and the ellipsis (\u2026) respectively. This differs in what is regarded as a single-byte character versus the first byte of a two-byte character from both EUC (where, of those, 0xFD and 0xFE are defined as lead bytes) and GBK (where, of those, 0x81, 0x82, 0xFD and 0xFE are defined as lead bytes).\nThis use of 0xA0, 0xFD, 0xFE and 0xFF matches Apple's Shift_JIS variant.\nBesides these changes to the lead byte range, the other distinctive feature of the double-byte portion of Mac OS Chinese Simplified is the inclusion of two extensions to the basic GB 2312-80 set in rows 6 and 8. These are considered \"standard extensions to GB 2312\", neither of which is proprietary to Apple: the row 8 extension was taken from GB 6345.1, both extensions are included by GB/T 12345 (the Traditional Chinese variant of GB 2312), and both extensions are included by GB 18030 (the successor to GB 2312).\n\n\n== EUC-JP ==\nEUC-JP is a variable-width encoding used to represent the elements of three Japanese character set standards, namely JIS X 0208, JIS X 0212, and JIS X 0201. Other names for this encoding include Unixized JIS (or UJIS) and AT&T JIS. 0.1% of all web pages use EUC-JP since August 2018, while 2.5% of websites in Japanese use this encoding (less used than Shift JIS, or UTF-8). It is called Code page 954 by IBM. Microsoft has two code page numbers for this encoding (51932 and 20932).\nThis encoding scheme allows the easy mixing of 7-bit ASCII and 8-bit Japanese without the need for the escape characters employed by ISO-2022-JP, which is based on the same character set standards, and without ASCII bytes appearing as trail bytes (unlike Shift JIS).\nA related and partially compatible encoding, called EUC-JISx0213 or EUC-JIS-2004, encodes JIS X 0201 and JIS X 0213 (similarly to Shift_JISx0213, its Shift_JIS-based counterpart).\nCompared to EUC-CN or EUC-KR, EUC-JP did not become as widely adopted on PC and Macintosh systems in Japan, which used Shift JIS or its extensions (Windows code page 932 on Microsoft Windows, and MacJapanese on classic Mac OS), although it became heavily used by Unix or Unix-like operating systems (except for HP-UX). Therefore, whether Japanese web sites use EUC-JP or Shift_JIS often depends on what OS the author uses.\nCharacters are encoded as follows:\n\nAs an EUC/ISO 2022 compliant encoding, the C0 control characters, space and DEL are represented as in ASCII.\nA graphical character from ASCII (code set 0) is represented as its usual one-byte representation, in the range 0x21 \u2013 0x7E. While some variants of EUC-JP encode the lower half of JIS X 0201 here, most encode ASCII, including the W3C/WHATWG Encoding standard used by HTML5, and so does EUC-JIS-2004. While this means that 0x5C is typically mapped to Unicode as U+005C REVERSE SOLIDUS (the ASCII backslash), U+005C may be displayed as a Yen sign by certain Japanese-locale fonts, e.g. on Microsoft Windows, for compatibility with the lower half of JIS X 0201.\nA character from JIS X 0208 (code set 1) is represented by two bytes, both in the range 0xA1 \u2013 0xFE. This differs from the ISO-2022-JP representation by having the high bit set. This code set may also contain vendor extensions in some EUC-JP variants. In EUC-JIS-2004, the first plane of JIS X 0213 is encoded here, which is effectively a superset of standard JIS X 0208.\nA character from the upper half of JIS X 0201 (half-width kana, code set 2) is represented by two bytes, the first being 0x8E, the second being the usual JIS X 0201 representation in the range 0xA1 \u2013 0xDF. This set may contain IBM vendor extensions in some variants.\nA character from JIS X 0212 (code set 3) is represented in EUC-JP by three bytes, the first being 0x8F, the following two being in the range 0xA1\u20130xFE, i.e. with the high bit set. In addition to standard JIS X 0212, code set 3 of some EUC-JP variants may also contain extensions in rows 83 and 84 to represent characters from IBM's Shift JIS extensions which lack standard JIS X 0212 mappings, which may be coded in either of two layouts, one defined by IBM themselves and one defined by the OSF. In EUC-JIS-2004, the second plane of JIS X 0213 is encoded here, which does not collide with the allocated rows in standard JIS X 0212. Some implementations of EUC-JIS-2004, such as the one used by Python, allow both JIS X 0212 and JIS X 0213 plane 2 characters in this set.\n\n\n=== Related Japanese encoding methods ===\nVendor extensions to EUC-JP (from, for example, the Open Software Foundation, IBM or NEC) were often allocated within the individual code sets, as opposed to using invalid EUC sequences (as in popular extensions of EUC-CN and EUC-KR).\nHowever, some vendor-specific encodings are partially compatible with EUC-JP, due to encoding JIS X 0208 over GR, but do not follow the packed EUC structure. Often, these do not include use of the single shifts from EUC-JP, and are thus not straight extensions of EUC-JP, with the exception of Super DEC Kanji.\n\n\n==== DEC Kanji ====\nDigital Equipment Corporation defines two variants of EUC-JP only partly conforming to the EUC packed format, but also bearing some resemblance to the complete two-byte format. The overall format of the \"DEC Kanji\" encoding mostly corresponds to fixed-width (complete two-byte) EUC; however, code set 0 is not required to be left-padded with null bytes (similarly to the packed format). JIS X 0208 is, as usual, used for code set 1; code set 2 (half-width katakana) is absent; code set 3 is encoded like the two-byte fixed width format (i.e. without a shift byte and with only the first high bit set), but used for two-byte user defined characters rather than being specified for JIS X 0212. In the basic \"DEC Kanji\" encoding, only the first 31 rows of code set 3 are used for user-defined characters: rows 32 through 94 are reserved, similarly to the unused rows in code set 1.The \"Super DEC Kanji\" encoding accepts codes both from the \"DEC Kanji\" encoding and from packed-format EUC, for a total of five code-sets. It also allows the entire user defined code set, and the unused rows at the ends of the JIS X 0208 and JIS X 0212 code sets (rows 85\u201394 and 78\u201394 respectively), to be used for user-defined characters.\n\n\n==== HP-16 ====\nHewlett-Packard defines an encoding referred to as \"HP-16\". This accompanies their \"HP-15\" encoding, which is a variant of Shift JIS. HP-16 encodes JIS X 0208 using the same bytes as in EUC-JP, but does not use the single shift codes (thus omitting code sets 2 and 3), and adds three user-defined regions which do not follow the packed-format EUC structure:\nLead bytes 0xA1\u2013C2, trail bytes 0x21\u20137E\nLead bytes 0xC3\u2013E3, trail bytes 0x21\u20133F\nLead bytes 0xC3\u2013E1, trail bytes 0x40\u201364\n\n\n==== IKIS ====\nThe IKIS (Interactive Kanji Information System) encoding used by Data General resembles EUC-JP without single shifts, i.e. with only code sets 0 and 1. Half-width katakana are instead included in row 8 of JIS X 0208 (colliding with the box-drawing characters added to the standard in 1983). JIS X 0208 rows 9 through 12 are used for user-defined characters.\n\n\n==== Adaptations of EUC-JP for EBCDIC ====\n\nKEIS (Kanji-processing Extended Information System) is an EBCDIC encoding used by Hitachi, with double-byte characters (a DBCS-Host encoding) included using shifting sequences, making it a stateful encoding. Specifically, the sequence 0x0A 0x41 switches to single-byte mode and the sequence 0x0A 0x42 switches to double-byte mode. However, JIS X 0208 characters are encoded using the same byte sequences used to encode them in EUC-JP. This results in duplicate encodings for the ideographic space\u20140x4040 per the DBCS-Host code structure, and 0xA1A1 as in EUC-JP. This differs from IBM's DBCS-Host encoding for Japanese, the layout of which builds on versions which predate JIS X 0208 altogether. The lead byte range is extended back to 0x59, out of which the lead bytes 0x81\u2013A0 are designated for user-defined characters, and the remainder are used for corporate-defined characters, including both kanji and non-kanji.JEF (Japanese-processing Extended Feature) is an EBCDIC encoding used on Fujitsu FACOM mainframes, contrasting with FMR (a variant of Shift JIS) used on Fujitsu PCs. Like KEIS, JEF is a stateful encoding, switching to a double-byte DBCS-Host mode using shifting sequences (where 0x29 switches to single-byte mode and 0x28 switches to double-byte mode). Also similarly to KEIS, JIS X 0208 codes are represented the same as in EUC-JP. The lead byte range is extended back to 0x41, with 0x80\u2013A0 designated for user definition; lead bytes 0x41\u20137F are assigned row numbers 101 through 163 for kuten purposes, although row 162 (lead byte 0x7E) is unused. Rows 101 through 148 are used for extended kanji, while rows 149 through 163 are used for extended non-kanji.\n\n\n== EUC-KR ==\n\nEUC-KR is a variable-width encoding to represent Korean text using two coded character sets, KS X 1001 (formerly KS C 5601) and either ISO 646:KR (KS X 1003, formerly KS C 5636) or US-ASCII, depending on variant. KS X 2901 (formerly KS C 5861) stipulates the encoding and RFC 1557 dubbed it as EUC-KR.\nA character drawn from KS X 1001 (G1, code set 1) is encoded as two bytes in GR (0xA1\u20130xFE) and a character from KS X 1003 or US-ASCII (G0, code set 0) takes one byte in GL (0x21\u20130x7E).\nIt is usually referred to as Wansung (Korean: \uc644\uc131, romanized: Wanseong, lit.\u2009'precomposed') in the Republic of Korea. IBM refers to the double-byte component as Code page 971, and to EUC-KR with ASCII as Code page 970. It is implemented as Code page 20949 (\"Korean Wansung\") and Code page 51949 (\"EUC Korean\") by Microsoft.As of September 2021, 0.1% of all web pages globally use EUC-KR, which is misleading as  8.9% of South Korean web pages use (only country the encoding is meant for), making it the most popular non-UTF-8/Unicode encoding for a language/web domain, while only 6.0% of web pages using Korean language  (making UTF-8 use, at 90.5%, less popular in South Korea than in (seemingly) all countries of the world). Including extensions, it is the most widely used legacy character encoding in Korea on all three major platforms (macOS, other Unix-like OSes, and Windows), but its use has been very slowly shifting to UTF-8 as it gains popularity, especially on Linux and macOS.\nAs with most other encodings, UTF-8 is now preferred for new use, solving problems with consistency between platforms and vendors.\n\n\n=== Related Korean encoding systems ===\n\n\n==== Unified Hangul Code ====\n\nA common extension of EUC-KR is the Unified Hangul Code (\ud1b5\ud569\ud615 \ud55c\uae00 \ucf54\ub4dc, Tonghabhyeong Hangeul Kodeu, or \ud1b5\ud569 \uc644\uc131\ud615, Tonghab Wansunghyung), which is the default Korean codepage on Microsoft Windows. It is given the code page number 949 by Microsoft, and 1261 or 1363 by IBM. IBM's code page 949 is a different, unrelated, EUC-KR extension.\nUnified Hangul Code extends EUC-KR by using codes which do not conform to the EUC structure to incorporate additional syllable blocks, completing the coverage of the composed syllable blocks available in Johab and Unicode. The W3C/WHATWG Encoding Standard used by HTML5 incorporates the Unified Hangul Code extensions into its definition of EUC-KR.\n\n\n==== Mac OS Korean (HangulTalk) ====\nOther encodings incorporating EUC-KR as a subset include the Mac OS Korean script (known as Code page 10003 or x-mac-korean), which was used by HangulTalk (MacOS-KH), the Korean localisation of the classic Mac OS. It was developed by Elex Computer (\uc77c\ub809\uc2a4), who were at the time the authorised distributor of Apple Macintosh computers in South Korea.HangulTalk adds extension characters with lead bytes between 0xA1 and 0xAD, both in unused space within the EUC-KR GR plane (trail bytes 0xA1\u20130xFE), and using non-EUC codes outside of it (trail bytes 0x41\u20130xA0). Some of these characters are font-style-independent stylised dingbats. Many of these characters do not have exact Unicode mappings, and Apple software maps these cases variously to combining sequences, to approximate mappings with an appended private-use character as a modifier for round-trip purposes, or to private-use characters.Apple also uses certain single-byte codes outside of the EUC-KR plane for additional characters: 0x80 for a required space, 0x81 for a won sign (\u20a9), 0x82 for an en dash (\u2013), 0x83 for a copyright sign (\u00a9), 0x84 for a wide underscore (\uff3f) and 0xFF for an ellipsis (\u2026). Although none of these additional single-byte codes are within the lead byte range of plain EUC-KR (unlike Apple's extensions to EUC-CN, see above), some are within the lead byte range of Unified Hangul Code (specifically, 0x81, 0x82, 0x83 and 0x84).\n\n\n== EUC-KP ==\n\nSimilarly to KS X 1001, the North Korean KPS 9566 standard is typically used in EUC form; in these contexts, it is sometimes referred to as EUC-KP. More recent editions of the standard extend the EUC representation with characters using non-EUC two-byte codes, in a similar manner to Unified Hangul Code.\n\n\n== EUC-TW ==\nEUC-TW is a variable-width encoding that supports US-ASCII and 16 planes of CNS 11643, each of which is 94x94. It is a rarely used encoding for traditional Chinese characters as used in Taiwan. Variants of Big5 are much more common than EUC-TW, although Big5 only encodes the first two planes of CNS 11643 hanzi, while UTF-8 is becoming more common.\n\nAs an EUC/ISO 2022 encoding, the C0 control characters, ASCII space and DEL are encoded as in ASCII.\nA graphical character from US-ASCII (G0, code set 0) is encoded in GL as its usual single byte representation (0x21\u20130x7E).\nA character from CNS 11643 plane 1 (code set 1) is encoded as two bytes in GR (0xA1\u20130xFE).\nA character in plane 1 through 16 of CNS 11643 (code set 2) is encoded as four bytes:\nThe first byte is always 0x8E (Single Shift 2).\nThe second byte (0xA1\u20130xB0) indicates the plane, the number of which is obtained by subtracting 0xA0 from that byte.\nThe third and fourth bytes are in GR (0xA1\u20130xFE).Note that the plane 1 of CNS 11643 is encoded twice as code set 1 and a part of code set 2.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCJK\nJapanese language and computers\nKorean language and computers\nChinese character encoding\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nEUC-JP codeset table (minus the ASCII and halfwidth parts)\nCode Page Identifiers\nGB18030-2000 \u2013  The New Chinese National Standard\nThe New Generation of Pre-Press Software in China \u2013  mentions the 748 code\nDescription of the EUC-TW code (in Chinese)\nManual page of EUC-JISX0213 in the Perl Encode module\nInternational Register of Coded Character Sets to be Used With Escape Sequence \u2013  section 2.4 (p.14f.) with the coded character sets of China, Japan, South Korea, North Korea and Taiwan (ISO/IEC)\nChinese, Japanese, and Korean character set standards and encoding systems", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ef/EUC-JP.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/EUC-KR_without_extensions.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fb/EUCCN_encoding.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Ecma43_versus_EUC.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg"], "summary": "Extended Unix Code (EUC) is a multibyte character encoding system used primarily for Japanese, Korean, and simplified Chinese.\nThe most commonly used EUC codes are variable-width encodings with a character belonging an ISO/IEC 646 compliant coded character set (such as ASCII) taking one byte, and a character belonging to a 94x94 coded character set (such as GB 2312) represented in two bytes. The EUC-CN form of GB 2312 and EUC-KR are examples of such two-byte EUC codes. EUC-JP includes characters represented by up to three bytes, including an initial shift code, whereas a single character in EUC-TW can take up to four bytes.\nModern applications are more likely to use UTF-8, which supports all of the glyphs of the EUC codes, and more, and is generally more portable with fewer vendor deviations and errors. EUC is however still very popular, especially EUC-KR for South Korea.\n\n"}}, "#render": {"_": "<html hidden><meta charset=utf-8></html><script src=/render.js></script></html>", "css": "/styles.css"}}
