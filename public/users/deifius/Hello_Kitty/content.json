"Hello Kitty (Japanese: \u30cf\u30ed\u30fc\u30fb\u30ad\u30c6\u30a3, Hepburn: Har\u014d Kiti), also known by her full name Kitty White (\u30ad\u30c6\u30a3\u30fb\u30db\u30ef\u30a4\u30c8, Kiti Howaito), is a fictional character produced by the Japanese company Sanrio, created by Yuko Shimizu and currently designed by Yuko Yamaguchi. Sanrio depicts Hello Kitty as a young female gijinka (anthropomorphization) of a Japanese Bobtail cat with a red bow and no mouth. According to her backstory, she is a perpetual 3rd-grade student who lives outside of London. Kitty and her twin sister, Mimi, celebrate their birthday on 1 November 1974. Since the cartoon character's creation, the Hello Kitty media franchise has grown to include clothing, accessories, toys, games, books, manga, anime series, and music albums, along with other various product lines and media productions.\nShortly after Hello Kitty's creation in 1974, the Hello Kitty vinyl coin purse was introduced by Sanrio in March 1975. Sanrio brought the character to the United States in 1976. By 2010, Sanrio had turned Hello Kitty into a global marketing phenomenon, worth $6 billion a year. By 2014, when Hello Kitty was 40 years old, she was worth about $8 billion a year. Hello Kitty has become one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.\nHello Kitty is a staple of the kawaii segment of Japanese popular culture. First marketed toward pre-teenage girls, Hello Kitty's image found commercial success among not only her original target audience but adolescent and adult consumers as well. A variety of products ranging from school supplies to fashion accessories to motor oil have featured the character over the years. A number of Hello Kitty TV series targeted towards children have been produced, as well as several manga comics and anime films. There are Sanrio theme parks based on Hello Kitty: Harmonyland in Hiji, \u014cita, Japan; Sanrio Puroland in Tama New Town, Tokyo, Japan; and the former Sanrio Hello Kitty Town in Iskandar Puteri, Johor, Malaysia.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Origins ===\nIn 1962, Shintaro Tsuji, founder of Sanrio, began selling rubber sandals with flowers painted on them. Tsuji noted the profits gained by adding a cute design to the shoes and hired cartoonists to design cute characters for his merchandise. The company produced a line of character merchandise centered around gift-giving occasions. Hello Kitty was designed by Yuko Shimizu and was added to the lineup of early Sanrio characters in 1974. The character's first appearance on an item was in March 1975 on a vinyl coin purse sold in Japan, where she was pictured sitting between a bottle of milk and a goldfish bowl. She first appeared in the United States in 1976 when Sanrio opened a Gift Gate store in San Jose, California.Sanrio decided to make Hello Kitty British because foreign countries, including Britain in particular, were trendy in Japan at the time of Hello Kitty's creation. Sanrio already had several characters set in the US, and it wanted Hello Kitty to be different. Shimizu got the name Kitty from Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass; during a scene early in the book, Alice plays with a cat she calls Kitty. Sanrio's motto is \"social communication,\" and Tsuji wanted the brand name to reflect that by including a greeting. He first considered \"Hi Kitty\" before finally settling on \"Hello Kitty,\" her current name.\n\n\n=== Commercial success ===\nHello Kitty sold well immediately after her 1975 launch, and Sanrio's sales increased sevenfold. Due to Japan's growing economy, many Japanese children could afford to buy Hello Kitty products. Her popularity has also been attributed to the emergence of kawaii culture, which embraces cuteness.Originally, Hello Kitty was only marketed towards a child and preteen audience. In the 1990s, the target market for Hello Kitty was broadened to include teenagers and adults as a retro brand. Marketing to those who could not get Hello Kitty merchandise as children, and those who fondly remember items they had, Sanrio began selling Hello Kitty branded products such as purses and laptops. The 1994\u20131996 Face series was the first to be designed specifically for mature consumers.According to Sanrio, Hello Kitty was appearing on 12,000 new products each year as of 1999. By 2008, Hello Kitty was responsible for half of Sanrio's $1 billion net income, and there were over 50,000 different Hello Kitty branded products in more than 60 countries. Beginning in 2007, following trends in Japan, Sanrio began using darker designs for Hello Kitty with more black and less pink and pulled away from kawaii styles.\n\n\n=== Recent history ===\nHello Kitty and Mimi celebrated their 40th anniversary on 1 November 2014. The \"Arigato Everyone Birthday Celebration\" took place in Sanrio Puroland in Tokyo for several days. In Los Angeles, a four-day convention, Hello Kitty Con, was also held in celebration of the anniversary. The convention attracted over 25,000 fans.On 1 January 2020, Sanrio Hello Kitty Town in Iskandar Puteri, Malaysia permanently closed down due to lack of attendance. On 21 February 2020, the Sanrio Puroland theme park (also known as Hello Kitty Land) in Tokyo closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Park officials hoped to have it reopened in early April 2020. In June 2020, Sanrio issued a statement that its founder, Shintaro Tsuji, would retire from his position as Sanrio's chief executive on 1 July 2020, and his grandson, Tomokuni Tsuji, 31, would take over to \"ensure efficient decision making.\"\n\n\n== Design ==\nSpokespeople for Sanrio have confirmed that Hello Kitty has no mouth, as they want people to \"project their feelings onto the character\" and \"be happy or sad together with Hello Kitty.\" Another explanation Sanrio has given for Hello Kitty's lack of a mouth is that she \"speaks from the heart. She's Sanrio's ambassador to the world and isn't bound to any particular language.\" Representatives for Sanrio have said that they see Hello Kitty as a symbol of friendship, which they hope she will foster between people across the world. There has been speculation that Hello Kitty has her origins in Maneki Neko\u2014the name \"Hello Kitty\" is a back-translation of Maneki Neko, meaning \"beckoning cat\" in English. Despite this, no definitive statement supports that speculation.New series involving Hello Kitty with different themed designs are released regularly, following current trends. Yuko Yamaguchi, the main designer for most of Hello Kitty's history, has said that fashion, movies, and TV inspire her in creating new designs.\n\n\n== Products ==\n\nOriginally aimed at the pre-adolescent female market, the Hello Kitty product range has expanded from dolls, stickers, greeting cards, clothes, backpacks, lunch boxes, piggy banks, pencils, erasers, accessories, school supplies and stationery to purses, toasters, televisions, other home appliances, massagers, and computer equipment. These products range from mass market items to high-end consumer products and rare collectibles. As of 2014, more than 50,000 Hello Kitty product lines were available in over 130 countries.\n\n\n=== High-end ===\nSanrio and various corporate partners have released Hello Kitty-branded products, including the Hello Kitty Stratocaster electric guitar (since 2006, with Fender in the US)  and an Airbus A330-200 commercial passenger jet airliner, dubbed the Hello Kitty Jet (2005\u20132009, with EVA Airways in Taiwan). In late 2011 and early 2012, EVA Air revived their \"Hello Kitty Jets\" with their three new A330-300s. However, due to high demand, the airline added two more alongside their existing A330-200s in mid-2012. A year later, EVA Air introduced one of their 777-300ERs as another Hello Kitty Jet, which featured other Sanrio characters as well as Hello Kitty.\nIn 2009, Hello Kitty entered the wine market with a collection of four wines available for purchase online, continuing the expansion of product lines targeted at older audiences.\n\n\n=== Jewelry ===\nIn Spring 2005, Simmons Jewelry Co. and Sanrio announced a partnership. \"Kimora Lee Simmons for Hello Kitty\" was launched exclusively at Neiman Marcus, with prices ranging from $300 to $5000.

While initially aimed at pre-teen girls, the Hello Kitty Stratocaster has since been used by famous guitarists including Zakk Wylde, John5, and Slash. The guitar's cult following has caused prices to rise, with second hand guitars going for over \u00a3660 in 2020.\n\n\n== Media ==\n\n\n=== Animated series ===\n\nThere have been several different Hello Kitty TV series. The first animated television series was Hello Kitty's Furry Tale Theater, an anime series that was 13 episodes long and aired in 1987.

In early 2019, it was revealed that New Line Cinema will be teaming up alongside Sanrio and Flynn Picture Company for an \u201cEnglish language film based on the venerable kid brand.\u201d In 2021, it was reported that Jennifer Coyle and Leo Matsuda have been hired to direct the film with Lindsey Beer set to pen the script.\n\n\n== Reception ==\nThe Hello Kitty brand rose to greater prominence internationally during the late 1990s. At that time, several celebrities, such as Mariah Carey, had adopted Hello Kitty as a fashion statement. Newer products featuring the character can be found in a large variety of American department stores.\nHello Kitty's popularity in Japan peaked in the late 1990s when she was the country's top-grossing character. In 2002, Hello Kitty lost her place as the top-grossing character in Japan in the Character Databank popularity chart. In a 2010 survey, she was in third place behind Anpanman and Pikachu from Pok\u00e9mon. In 2010, The New York Times attributed the character's relative decline in Japan to her biography not being \"compelling enough to draw many fans.\" The newspaper later wrote that analysts called the characterization \"weak,\" and that Hello Kitty not having a mouth has dampened her success as an animated TV character. Hello Kitty has nevertheless remained one of the top three highest-grossing characters in Japan as of 2013.Overseas, her global popularity has increased over the years, with worldwide annual sales reaching $8 billion in 2013. She has been particularly popular in other Asian countries for decades, such as in China, where her cultural impact is comparable to that of Barbie in the Western world. In the United States, she is recognized by more than 80% of young adults in the 18\u201323 age group, as of 2016.\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\nIn May 2008, Japan named Hello Kitty the ambassador of Japanese tourism in both China and Hong Kong (where the character is exceptionally popular among children and young women), marking the first time Japan's tourism ministry had appointed a fictional character to the role. Dr. Sharon Kinsella, a lecturer at Oxford University on Japanese sociology, called the selection of Hello Kitty \"a bit farcical ... as if a dumbed-down cultural icon ... can somehow do something significant to alter the gnarly and difficult state of China-Japan relations.\"UNICEF has also awarded Hello Kitty the exclusive title of UNICEF Special Friend of Children.\n\n\n=== Sales ===\n\n\n=== Controversy ===\nIn July 2008, the Dutch artist Dick Bruna, creator of Miffy, alleged that Hello Kitty is a copy of Miffy (in Dutch: Nijntje), being rendered in a similar style. He stated disapprovingly in an interview for the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph:\n\n'That,' he says darkly, 'is a copy [of Miffy], I think. I don't like that at all. I always think, \"No, don't do that. Try to make something that you think of yourself.\"'Mercis, the firm that managed copyrights for Bruna, took Sanrio to court over their Hello Kitty-associated character Cathy, a rabbit which made her first appearance in 1976 and which Mercis argued infringed the copyright for Miffy. A court in Amsterdam ruled in favour of Mercis in November 2010 and ordered Sanrio to stop the production and sale of merchandise featuring Cathy in the Benelux countries. However, in June 2011, the two companies announced that they had reached a settlement agreement to end their legal dispute. Sanrio stopped using the Cathy character, and the two firms jointly donated \u20ac150,000 for reconstruction after the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami.Musti, a cat character created by Belgian cartoonist Ray Goossens, was also cited as an inspiration for Hello Kitty.\n\n\n== Sculpture ==\nIn 1994, artist Tom Sachs was invited to create a scene for Barneys New York Christmas displays and titled it Hello Kitty Nativity. In the scene, the Virgin Mary was replaced by Madonna with an open Chanel bra, the three Kings were all Bart Simpson, the stable was marked by a McDonald's logo, and the Christ Child was replaced by Hello Kitty. This contemporary revision of the nativity scene demonstrated Sachs' interest in the phenomena of consumerism, branding, and the cultural fetishization of products. Many audiences instead took offense to the artwork, which received backlash from Catholic organizations for its misuse of Christian symbolism.\nIn 2009, Tom Sachs' Bronze Collection was shown at the Public art space in Manhattan's Lever House, as well as in the Baldwin Gallery in Aspen, Colorado, and the Trocad\u00e9ro in Paris. The collection featured white bronze casts of a foam core Hello Kitty sculpture \u2013 a style distinctive to the artist. As of April 2010, the Wind-Up Hello Kitty sculpture is still on display at Lever House.  Although Sachs did not seek permission to use the character in his work, a brand marketing manager for Sanrio was quoted as saying \"You know, there was Marilyn Monroe and Andy Warhol, and then Michael Jackson and Jeff Koons. When you're an icon, that's what happens.\"In 2015, a 9-foot tall pearlescent Hello Kitty sculpture by artist Sebastian Masuda was exhibited at the Dag Hammarskjold Plaza in New York City, as part of the Japan Society's exhibition: Life of Cats: Selections from the Hiraki Ukiyo-e Collection.\n\n\n== See also ==\n Japan portal\n Anime and manga portal\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial Hello Kitty website\nHello Kitty at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.
