Until the mid-1800s the canoe was an important means of transport for exploration and trade, and in some places is still used as such, sometimes with the addition of an outboard motor. Where the canoe played a key role in history, such as the northern United States, Canada, and New Zealand, it remains an important theme in popular culture.\nCanoes are now widely used for competition and pleasure, such as racing, whitewater, touring and camping, freestyle and general recreation. Canoeing has been part of the Olympics since 1936. The intended use of the canoe dictates its hull shape, length, and construction material. Historically, canoes were dugouts or made of bark on a wood frame, but construction materials evolved to canvas on a wood frame, then to aluminum. Most modern canoes are made of molded plastic or composites such as fiberglass.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nThe word canoe came into English from the French, who had borrowed it from the Spanish. They in turn had borrowed the word from the Arawakan languages of the Caribbean.\n\n\n=== Dugouts ===\n\nMany peoples made dugout canoes, by carving out a single piece of wood; either a whole trunk, or a slab of trunk from particularly large trees.Constructed between 8200 and 7600 BC, and found in the Netherlands, the Pesse canoe may be the oldest known canoe. Excavations in Denmark reveal the use of dugouts and paddles during the Erteb\u00f8lle period, (c. 5300\u20133950 BC).One of the oldest canoes in the world is the Dufuna canoe in Nigeria. It is the oldest boat to be discovered in Africa, and the third oldest known worldwide. The canoe is currently in Damaturu, the state capital.Canoes have also played a vital role in the colonisation of the Pre-Columbian Caribbean as they represented the only possibility of reaching the Caribbean Islands from mainland South America. Around 3500 BC ancient Amerindian groups colonised the first Caribbean Islands using single-hulled canoes. Only very few Pre-Columbian Caribbean canoes have been uncovered.  There are several families of trees that could have been used to construct Caribbean canoes. These include woods of the mahogany family (Meliaceae) such as the Cuban mahogany (Swietenia mahagoni), that can reach heights of 30\u201335 m, the ceiba family (Malvacae) such as Ceiba pentandra, than can grow up to 60\u201370 m tall and the cedar family such as the Red Cedar (Cedrela odorata) that can grow up to 60 m in height. It is likely that these canoes were built in a variety of sizes. Ranging from fishing canoes, holding one or a few individuals, to larger ones able to carry as many as a few dozen people that could have been used to reach the Caribbean Islands from the mainland. Reports by historical chroniclers claim to have witnessed a canoe \"containing 40 to 50 Caribs [...] when it came out to trade with a visiting English ship\". These is still much dispute regarding the use of sails in Caribbean canoes. Some archaeologists doubt that oceanic transportation would have been possible without the use of sails as winds and currents would have carried the canoes off course. However, no evidence of a sail or a Caribbean canoe that could have made use of a sail has been found. Furthermore, no historical sources mention Caribbean canoes with sails. One possibility could be that canoes with sails were initially used in the Caribbean but later abandoned before European contact. This, however, seems unlikely, as long-distance trade continued in the Caribbean even after the prehistoric colonisation of the islands. Hence, it is likely that early Caribbean colonists made use of canoes without sails.The indigenous people of the Amazon commonly used Hymenaea trees. \nNative American groups of the north Pacific coast made dugout canoes in a number of styles for different purposes, from western red-cedar (Thuja plicata) or yellow-cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis), depending on availability. Different styles were required for ocean-going vessels versus river boats, and for whale-hunting versus seal-hunting versus salmon-fishing. The Quinault of Washington State built shovel-nose canoes, with double bows, for river travel that could slide over a logjam without portaging. The Kootenai of British Columbia province made sturgeon-nosed canoes from pine bark, designed to be stable in windy conditions on Kootenay Lake. In recent years First Nations in British Columbia and Washington State have been revitalizing the ocean-going canoe tradition. Beginning in the 1980s, the Heiltsuk and Haida were early leaders in this movement. The paddle to Expo 86 in Vancouver by the Heiltsuk, and the 1989 Paddle to Seattle were early instances of this. In 1993 a large number of canoes paddled from up and down the coast to Bella Bella in its first canoe festival \u2013 'Qatuwas. The revitalization continued \u2013 and Tribal Journeys began with trips to various communities held most years.\nAustralian Aboriginal people made canoes from hollowed out tree trunks, as well as from tree bark.\n\n\n=== Skin canoes ===\n\n\n==== Australia ====\nSome Australian Aboriginal peoples made bark canoes. They could only be made from the bark of certain trees (usually red gum or box gum) and during summer. After cutting the outline of the required size and shape, a digging stick was used to cut through the bark to the hardwood, and the bark was then slowly prised out using numerous smaller sticks. The slab of bark was held in place by branches or hand-woven rope, and after separation from the tree, lowered to the ground and small fires lit on the inside of the bark. This would cause the bark to dry out and curl upwards, after which the ends could be pulled together and stitched with hemp and plugged with mud. It was then allowed to mature, with frequent applications of grease and ochre. The remaining tree was later dubbed a canoe tree by Europeans. Because of the porosity of the bark, they did not last too long (about two years), and were mainly used for fishing or crossing rivers or lakes rather than long journeys. They were usually propelled by punting with a long stick. Another type of bark canoe was made out of a type of stringybark gum known as Messmate stringybark (Eucalyptus obliqua), where the bark was pleated and tied at each end, with a framework of cross-ties and ribs. This type was known as a pleated or tied bark canoe. Bark strips could also be sewn together to make larger canoes, known as sewn bark canoes.\n\n\n==== Americas ====\nMany indigenous peoples of the Americas built bark canoes. They were usually skinned with birch bark over a light wooden frame, but other types could be used if birch was scarce. At a typical length of 4.3 m (14 ft) and weight of 23 kg (50 lb), the canoes were light enough to be portaged, yet could carry a lot of cargo, even in shallow water. Although susceptible to damage from rocks, they are easily repaired. Their performance qualities were soon recognized by early European settler colonials, and canoes played a key role in the exploration of North America, with Samuel de Champlain canoeing as far as the Georgian Bay in 1615. Ren\u00e9 de Br\u00e9hant de Galin\u00e9e, a French missionary who explored the Great Lakes in 1669, declared: \"The convenience of these canoes is great in these waters, full of cataracts or waterfalls, and rapids through which it is impossible to take any boat. When you reach them you load canoe and baggage upon your shoulders and go overland until the navigation is good; and then you put your canoe back into the water, and embark again. American painter, author and traveler George Catlin wrote that the bark canoe was \"the most beautiful and light model of all the water crafts that ever were invented\".\n\nThe first explorer to cross the North American continent, Alexander Mackenzie, used canoes extensively, as did David Thompson and the Lewis and Clark Expedition.\nIn the North American fur trade the Hudson's Bay Company's voyageurs used three types of canoe:\nThe rabaska or canot du ma\u00eetre was designed for the long haul from the St. Lawrence River to western Lake Superior. Its dimensions were: length approximately 11 m (35 ft), beam 1.2 to 1.8 m (4 to 6 ft), and height about 76 cm (30 in). It could carry 60 packs weighing 41 kg (90 lb), and 910 kg (2,000 lb) of provisions. With a crew of eight or ten (paddling or rowing), they could make three knots over calm waters. Four to six men could portage it, bottom up. Henry Schoolcraft declared it \"altogether one of the most eligible modes of conveyance that can be employed upon the lakes\". Archibald McDonald of the Hudson's Bay Company wrote: \"I never heard of such a canoe being wrecked, or upset, or swamped ... they swam like ducks.\"\nThe canot du nord (French: \"canoe of the north\"), a craft specially made and adapted for speedy travel, was the workhorse of the fur trade transportation system. About one-half the size of the Montreal canoe, it could carry about 35 packs weighing 41 kg (90 lb) and was manned by four to eight men. It could be carried by two men and was portaged in the upright position.\nThe express canoe or canot l\u00e9ger, was about 4.6 m (15 ft) long and were used to carry people, reports, and news.The birch bark canoe was used in a 6,500-kilometre (4,000 mi) supply route from Montreal to the Pacific Ocean and the Mackenzie River, and continued to be used up to the end of the 19th century.The indigenous peoples of eastern Canada and the northeast United States made canoes using the bark of the paper birch, which was harvested in early spring by stripping off the bark in one piece, using wooden wedges. Next, the two ends (stem and stern) were sewn together and made watertight with the pitch of balsam fir. The ribs of the canoe, called verons in Canadian French, were made of white cedar, and the hull, ribs, and thwarts were fastened using watap, a binding usually made from the roots of various species of conifers, such as the white spruce, black spruce, or cedar, and caulked with pitch.\n\n\n=== Modern canoes ===\n\nIn 19th-century North America, the birch-on-frame construction technique evolved into the wood-and-canvas canoes made by fastening an external waterproofed canvas shell to planks and ribs by boat builders such as Old Town Canoe, E. M. White Canoe, Peterborough Canoe Company and at the Chestnut Canoe Company in New Brunswick. While similar to bark canoes in the use of ribs, and a waterproof covering, the construction method is different, being built by bending ribs over a solid mold. Once removed from the mold, the decks, thwarts and seats are installed, and canvas is stretched tightly over the hull. The canvas is then treated with a combination of varnishes and paints to render it more durable and watertight.\n\nAlthough canoes were once primarily a means of transport, with industrialization they became popular as recreational or sporting watercraft. John MacGregor popularized canoeing through his books, and in 1866 founded the Royal Canoe Club in London and in 1880 the American Canoe Association. The Canadian Canoe Association was founded in 1900, and the British Canoe Union in 1936.\nSprint canoe was a demonstration sport at the 1924 Paris Olympics and became an Olympic discipline at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. The International Canoe Federation was formed in 1946 and is the umbrella organization of all national canoe organizations worldwide.\n\n\n== Hull design ==\n\nHull design must meet different, often conflicting, requirements for speed, carrying capacity, maneuverability, and stability The canoe's hull speed can be calculated using the principles of ship resistance and propulsion.\n\nLength: this is often stated by manufacturers as the overall length of the boat, but what counts in performance terms is the length of the waterline, and more specifically its value relative to the displacement of the canoe. Displacement is the amount of water displaced by the boat. It is equal to the total weight of the boat and its contents since a floating body displaces its own weight in water. When a canoe is paddled through water, it takes an effort to push all of the displaced water out of the way. Canoes are displacement hulls: the longer the waterline relative to its displacement, the faster it can be paddled. Among general touring canoeists, 5.18 m (17 ft) is a popular length, providing a good compromise between capacity and cruising speed. Too large a canoe will simply mean extra work paddling at cruising speed.\nWidth (beam): a wider boat provides more stability at the expense of speed. A canoe cuts through the water like a wedge, and a shorter boat needs a narrower beam to reduce the angle of the wedge cutting through the water. Canoe manufacturers typically provide three beam measurements: the gunwale (the measurement at the top of the hull), the waterline (the measurement at the point where the surface of the water meets the hull when it is empty), and the widest point. Another variation of the waterline beam measurement is called 4\" waterline where the displacement is taken into account. This measurement is done at the waterline level when the maximum load is applied to the canoe. Some canoe races use the 4\" waterline beam measurement as the standard for their regulations. In races, the measurement is done by measuring the widest point at 4 inches (10 cm) from the bottom of the canoe.\nFreeboard: a higher-sided boat stays drier in rough water. The cost of high sides is extra weight, extra wind resistance and increased susceptibility to cross-winds.\nStability and immersed bottom shape: the hull can be optimized for initial stability (the boat feels steady when it sits flat on the water) or final stability (resistance to rolling and capsizing). A flatter-bottomed hull has higher initial stability, versus a rounder or V-shaped hull in cross-section has high final stability. The fastest flat water non-racing canoes have sharp V-bottoms to cut through the water, but they are difficult to turn and have a deeper draft which makes them less suitable for shallows. Flat-bottomed canoes are most popular among recreational canoeists. At the cost of speed, they have a shallow draft, turn better, and more cargo space. The reason a flat bottom canoe has lower final stability is that the hull must wrap a sharper angle between the bottom and the sides, compared to a more round-bottomed boat. However, the sides of the canoe can be constructed where the gunwale sheer line is compressed inboard towards to keel line (rather than flaring outboard and outwards from the keel line) resulting in tumblehome, which increases final stability (increases the number of degrees of lateral roll possible before the gunwale is first submerged).\nKeel: an external keel makes a canoe track (hold its course) better and can stiffen a floppy bottom, but it can get stuck on rocks and decrease stability in rapids.\nProfile, the shape of the canoe's sides. Sides that flare out above the waterline deflect water but require the paddler to reach out over the side of the canoe. If the gunwale width is less than the waterline width (or the maximum width) the canoe is said to have tumblehome. This increases final hull stability.\nRocker: viewed from the side of the canoe, rocker is the amount of curve in the hull, much like the curve of a banana. A straight keeled canoe, with no rocker, is meant for covering long distances in a straight line. The full length of the hull is in the water, so it tracks well and has good speed. As the rocker increases, so does the ease of turning, at the cost of tracking. Native American birch-bark canoes were often characterized by extreme rocker.\nHull symmetry: viewed from above, a symmetrical hull has its widest point at the center of the hull and both ends are identical. An asymmetrical hull typically has the widest section aft of centerline, creating a longer bow and improving speed.\n\n\n== Modern materials and construction ==\n\n\n=== Plastic ===\nRoyalex is a composite material, comprising an outer layer of vinyl and hard acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic (ABS) and an inner layer of ABS foam, bonded by heat treatment. As a canoe material, Royalex is lighter, more resistant to UV damage, is more rigid, and has greater structural memory than non-composite plastics such as polyethylene.  Royalex canoes are, however, more expensive than aluminium canoes or canoes made from traditionally molded or roto-molded polyethylene hulls. It is heavier, and less suited for high-performance paddling than fiber-reinforced composites, such as fiberglass, kevlar, or graphite. Roto-molded polyethylene is a cheaper alternative to Royalex. Production of Royalex ceased in 2014.\nFolding canoes usually consist of a PVC skin around an aluminum frame.\nInflatable: These contain no rigid frame members and can be deflated, folded, and stored in a bag. The more durable types consist of an abrasion-resistant nylon or rubber outer shell, with separate PVC air chambers for the two side tubes and the floor.\n\n\n=== Fiber reinforced composites ===\nModern canoes are generally constructed by layering a fiber material inside a \"female\" mold. Fiberglass is the most common material used in manufacturing canoes. Fiberglass is not expensive, can be molded to any shape, and is easy to repair. Kevlar is popular with paddlers looking for a light, durable boat that will not be taken in whitewater. Fiberglass and Kevlar are strong but lack rigidity.  Carbon fiber is used in racing canoes to create a very light, rigid construction usually combined with Kevlar for durability. Boats are built by draping the cloth in a mold, then impregnating it with a liquid resin. Optionally, a vacuum process can be used to remove excess resin to reduce weight. \nA gel coat on the outside gives a smoother appearance.With stitch and glue, plywood panels are stitched together to form a hull shape, and the seams are reinforced with fiber reinforced composites and varnished.\nA cedar strip canoe is essentially a composite canoe with a cedar core. Usually fiberglass is used to reinforce the canoe since it is clear and allows a view of the cedar.\n\n\n=== Aluminum ===\nBefore the invention of fiberglass, this was the standard choice for whitewater canoeing. It is good value and very strong by weight. This material was once more popular but is being replaced by modern lighter materials. \"It is tough, durable, and will take being dragged over the bottom very well\", as it has no gel or polymer outer coating which would make it subject to abrasion.  The hull does not degrade from long term exposure to sunlight, and \"extremes of hot and cold do not affect the material\". It can dent, is difficult to repair, is noisy, can get stuck on underwater objects, and requires buoyancy chambers to assist in keeping the canoe afloat in a capsize.\n\n\n== In culture ==\n\nIn Canada, the canoe has been a theme in history and folklore, and is a symbol of Canadian identity. From 1935 to 1986 the Canadian silver dollar depicted a canoe with the Northern Lights in the background.\nThe Chasse-galerie is a French-Canadian tale of voyageurs who, after a night of heavy drinking on New Year's Eve at a remote timber camp want to visit their sweethearts some 100 leagues (about 400 km) away. Since they have to be back in time for work the next morning they make a pact with the devil. Their canoe will fly through the air, on condition that they not mention God's name or touch the cross of any church steeple as they fly by in the canoe. One version of this fable ends with the coup de gr\u00e2ce when, still high in the sky, the voyageurs complete the hazardous journey but the canoe overturns, so the devil can honour the pact to deliver the voyageurs and still claim their souls.\nIn John Steinbeck's novella The Pearl set in Mexico, the main character's canoe is a means of making a living that has been passed down for generations and represents a link to cultural tradition.The M\u0101ori, indigenous Polynesian people arrived in New Zealand in several waves of canoe voyage. Canoe traditions are important to the identity of M\u0101ori. Whakapapa (genealogical links) back to the crew of founding canoes served to establish the origins of tribes, and defined tribal boundaries and relationships.\n\n\n== Types ==\nModern canoe types are usually categorized by the intended use. Many modern canoe designs are hybrids (a combination of two or more designs, meant for multiple uses). The purpose of the canoe will also often determine the materials used. Most canoes are designed for either one person (solo) or two people (tandem), but some are designed for more than two people.\n\n\n=== Sprint ===\nSprint canoe is also known as flatwater racing. The paddler kneels on one knee, and uses a single-blade paddle. Canoes have no rudder, so the boat must be steered by the athlete's paddle using a j-stroke. Canoes may be entirely open or be partly covered. The minimum length of the opening on a C1 is 280 cm (110 in). Boats are long and streamlined with a narrow beam, which makes them very unstable.  A C4 can be up to 9 m (30 ft) long and weigh 30 kg (66 lb). ICF classes include C1 (solo), C2 (crew of two), and C4 (crew of four). Race distances at the 2012 Olympic Games were 200 and 1000 meters.\n\n\n=== Slalom and wildwater ===\n\nIn ICF whitewater slalom paddlers negotiate their way down a 300 m (980 ft) of whitewater rapids, through a series of up to 25 gates (pairs of hanging poles). The colour of the poles indicates the direction in which the paddlers must pass through; time penalties are assessed for striking poles or missing gates. Categories are C1 (solo) and C2 (tandem), the latter for two men, and C2M (mixed) for one woman and one man. C1 boats must have a minimum weight and width of 10 kg (22 lb) and 0.65 m (2 ft 2 in) and be not more than 3.5 m (11 ft) long. C2s must have a minimum weight and width of 15 kg (33 lb) and 0.75 m (2 ft 6 in), and be not more that 4.1 m (13 ft). Rudders are prohibited. Canoes are decked and propelled by single-bladed paddles, and the competitor must kneel.In ICF wildwater canoeing athletes paddle a course of class III to IV whitewater (using the International Scale of River Difficulty), passing over waves, holes and rocks of a natural riverbed in events lasting either 20\u201330 minutes (\"Classic\" races) or 2\u20133 minutes (\"Sprint\" races). Categories are C1 and C2, for both women and men. C1s must have a minimum weight and width of 12 kg (26 lb) and 0.7 m (2 ft 4 in), and a maximum length of 4.3 m (14 ft). C2s must have a minimum weight and width of 18 kg (40 lb) and 0.8 metres (2 ft 7 in), and a maximum length of 5 metres (16 ft). Rudders are prohibited. The canoes are decked boats which must be propelled by single bladed paddles and inside which the paddler kneels.\n\n\n=== Marathon ===\nMarathons are long-distance races which may include portages. Under ICF rules minimum canoe weight is 10 and 14 kg (22 and 31 lb) for C1 and C2 respectively. Other rules can vary by race, for example in the Classique Internationale de Canots de la Mauricie athletes race in C2s, with a maximum length of 5.6 m (18 ft 6 in), minimum width of 69 cm (27 in) at 8 cm (3 in) from the bottom of the centre of the craft, minimum height of 38 cm (15 in) at the bow and 25 cm (10 in) at the centre and stern. The Texas Water Safari, at 422 km (262 mi), includes an open class, the only rule being the vessel must be human-powered, and although novel setups have been tried, the fastest so far has been the six-man canoe.\n\n\n=== Touring ===\n\nA \"touring\" or \"tripping\" canoe is a boat for traveling on lakes and or rivers with capacity for camping gear. Tripping canoes such as the Chestnut Prospector and Old Town Tripper derivates are touring canoes for wilderness trips. They are typically made of heavier and tougher materials and designed with the ability to carry large amounts of gear while being maneuverable enough for rivers with some whitewater. Prospector is now a generic name for derivates of the Chestnut model, a popular type of wilderness tripping canoe marked by a shallow arch hull with a relatively large amount of rocker, giving a nice balance for wilderness tripping over lakes and rivers with some rapids.\nA touring canoe is sometimes covered with a greatly extended deck, forming a \"cockpit\" for the paddlers. A cockpit has the advantage that the gunwales can be made lower and narrower so the paddler can reach the water more easily.\n\n\n=== Freestyle ===\n\nA canoe specialized for whitewater play and tricks. Most are identical to short, flat-bottomed kayak playboats except for internal outfitting. The paddler kneels and uses a single-blade canoe paddle. Playboating is a discipline of whitewater canoeing where the paddler performs various technical moves in one place (a playspot), as opposed to downriver where the objective is to travel the length of a section of river (although whitewater canoeists will often stop and play en route). Specialized canoes known as playboats can be used.\n\n\n=== General recreation ===\nA square-stern canoe is an asymmetrical canoe with a squared-off stern for the mounting of an outboard motor, and is meant for lake travel or fishing. (In practice, use of a side bracket on a double-ended canoe often is more comfortable for the operator, with little or no loss of performance.) Since mounting a rudder on the square stern is very easy, such canoes often are adapted for sailing.\n\n\n== Canoe launches ==\nA canoe launch is a place for launching canoes, similar to a boat launch which is often for launching larger watercraft. Canoe launches are frequently on river banks or beaches. Canoe launches may be designated on maps of places such as parks or nature reserves.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Media related to Canoes at Wikimedia Commons", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/1998-10-tema-canoe.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/BWCA_Canoe_Outing_-_001.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Birchbark_canoe%2C_Abbe_Museum%2C_Bar_Harbor%2C_ME_IMG_2301.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/C1_Playboat.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/07/Canoe_lessons_%28I0005532%29.tif", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Canvas-stretching.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f5/Dickerson-C1a.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Dugout_canoe_Rennell.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Elm_Bank_canoe_launch_213345_929.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/FAHopkins_Shooting_Rapids.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Global_thinking.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Historic_Center_of_Quito_-_World_Heritage_Site_by_UNESCO_-_Photo_437.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/Kerala_backwater_20080218-11.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c2/La_Chasse-galerie_%281906%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Morris-canoe-600.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Native_tribes_of_South-East_Australia_Fig_24_-_A_Kurnai_bark_canoe.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/df/Parts_of_Canoe.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/PaulKane-HuntingFish-ROM.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Pf026012.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4c/Wikisource-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Women_C-2.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Women_Rowing_-_My_Tho_-_Vietnam.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg"], "summary": "A canoe is a lightweight narrow water vessel, typically pointed at both ends and open on top, propelled by one or more seated or kneeling paddlers facing the direction of travel and using a single-bladed paddle.In British English, the term \"canoe\" can also refer to a kayak, while canoes are then called Canadian or open canoes to distinguish them from kayaks.\nCanoes were developed by cultures all over the world, including some designed for use with sails or outriggers. Until the mid-1800s the canoe was an important means of transport for exploration and trade, and in some places is still used as such, sometimes with the addition of an outboard motor. Where the canoe played a key role in history, such as the northern United States, Canada, and New Zealand, it remains an important theme in popular culture.\nCanoes are now widely used for competition and pleasure, such as racing, whitewater, touring and camping, freestyle and general recreation. Canoeing has been part of the Olympics since 1936. The intended use of the canoe dictates its hull shape, length, and construction material. Historically, canoes were dugouts or made of bark on a wood frame, but construction materials evolved to canvas on a wood frame, then to aluminum. Most modern canoes are made of molded plastic or composites such as fiberglass."}, "Downhill_mountain_biking": {"links": ["Snowmass ", "Fell", "Sam Hill ", "Giant Slalom skiing", "Northern England",

mountain biking (DH) is a genre of mountain biking practiced on steep, rough terrain that often features jumps, drops, rock gardens and other obstacles.\nDownhill bikes are heavier and stronger than other mountain bikes and feature front and rear suspension with over 8 inches (20 cm) of travel, to glide quickly over rocks and tree roots. In competitive races, a continuous course is defined on each side by a strip of tape. Depending on the format, riders have a single or double attempt to reach the finish line as fast as possible, while remaining between the two tapes designating the course. Riders must choose their line by compromising between the shortest possible line and the line that can be traveled at the highest speed.  If a rider leaves the course by crossing or breaking the tape they must return to the course at the point of exit, unless they do not gain a time advantage from crossing the tape, in which case they can continue with their run.Riders start at intervals, often seeded from slowest to fastest, and courses typically take two to five minutes to complete with winning margins being often less than a second.  Riders are timed with equipment similar to that used in downhill skiing.\n\n\n== History of competitive racing ==\nThe 1st downhill time-trial race took place in Fairfax, California on October 21, 1976 on a fireroad now referred to as Repack Road, due to the need to repack the hub brake after each descent. The bikes used were based on cruiser bicycles that had a drum or coaster brake that worked by pedalling backwards. The mechanism operated with a conical brake shoe being wound on a thread in a metal hub. To prevent the brake from seizing it was kept filled with grease. Heavy use during the descent would cause the brake to over heat, softening the grease and causing it to drain from the hub, requiring frequent repacking. Ten riders descended 1,300 feet (400 m) of Repack road in about 5 minutes.The first bikes used for descending were known as \"klunkers\" or \"paperboy bikes\" - sturdy cruisers using balloon tires and coaster brakes, designed by Ignatz Schwinn during the Great Depression. The bikes could endure abuse that would damage other bicycles by changing features from the Henderson and Excelsior motorcycles his company had built during the 1920s, including a heavy \"cantilevered\" frame with two top tubes and 2.125-inch-wide (54.0 mm) \"balloon\" tires from Germany. Innovations like the fat-tire Schwinn with derailleur gears by Russ Mahon of  The Morrow Dirt Club in Cupertino at the 1974 Marin County cyclo-cross and Gary Fisher's 1975 use of a tandem rear hub (from a flea market) with a drum brake threaded for a freewheel cluster developed the sport, and by 1979, two organizers and competitors of the Repack downhill, Charlie Kelly and Gary Fisher founded the company which named the sport, MountainBikes. As mountain biking grew during the 80s, downhill riders continued to use either rigid or limited-travel (under 2 inches (5 cm)) suspension bicycles. Purpose-made downhill bikes started to appear in the 90s, with innovations such as dual crown forks and disc brakes, as well as more elaborate suspension designs.\nLater, riders from other disciplines began focusing on downhill, such as BMX racers Daniel Solano (Team Tomac Bikes), and Brian Lopes. Their influence is seen in the increased difficulty of many courses, with bigger jumps and drops added. The coming of age for downhill biking was its inclusion at the first UCI Mountain Bike Championship, held in 1990 in Durango, Colorado.\n\n\n== Notable downhill racing venues ==\n\nMany ski areas are converted into downhill mountain biking venues in the summer, such as Whistler Mountain Bike Park and Fernie Alpine Resort, alongside the specifically developed all-season downhill trails. At some courses, bikers ride gondolas, trams or chair lifts to the starting point, or \"shuttling\" with motorized vehicles is used to transport riders to the top of the hill. Others are accessible by riding (or pushing) bicycles to the starting point. Urban downhill courses have also appeared in mountain-side cities, with the courses going through city streets and sidewalks, such as the Taxco Downhill event in Mexico.Courses used in competition often feature several \"lines\" through or around difficult obstacles. For example, the \"A line\" might be a direct line over a large jump with a sketchy landing, the \"B line\" a smaller jump with a better landing, and the \"C line\" completely avoids the jumps, but may take longer.\n\n\n=== Australia ===\n\nAustralia has produced a large number of internationally successful downhill racers,  including Sam Hill, Chris Kovarik, Nathan Rennie and Mick Hannah. The large majority of Australian downhill riding and racing is accessed by shuttling in cars, buses or by walking to the top of the track (push runs), however the venues at Mount Buller and Thredbo provide lift accessed tracks during the snow less summer months.\nMount Stromlo, near Canberra, hosted a World Cup Round in August 2008 and the 2009 World Championships. The top can be accessed by either riding up singletrack, or by shuttling via the road. Australia's first UCI Mountain Bike World Cup was held in Cairns in 1994-1995. followed by the World Mountain Bike Championships in 1996 and again in 2017, placing Cairns on the map as the premier Australian mountain bike destination.\n\n\n=== Austria ===\nLocated in the Alps, Austria is very suitable for downhill riding. A large majority of Austria's downhill tracks are accessible via lift shuttles. A World Cup track called the \"Planai\" is located in the city of Schladming. It is about 5 km long with an average descent grade of about 35%.\n\n\n=== Bolivia ===\nMost of Bolivia\u2019s downhill riding is done in the Andes Mountains in and around La Paz. In the city there is the Pura Pura trail, there are also a few trails through the forest. Camiraya at the outskirts of La Paz has more and longer trails. The Loma Loma and Chu Chu trails are a little further out in Sorata. There are also trails in other parts of the country, for example in Cochabamba and Potos\u00ed.\n\n\n=== Bosnia and Herzegovina ===\nBosnia and Herzegovina is rich with mountains especially around the capital city of Sarajevo, in which a downtown race is held, although mountain bike and downhill especially are still developing to become known sports. Mountains like Igman, Bjela\u0161nica and others are being increasingly used for downhill racing. Currently there are a few tracks on Trebevi\u0107, Igman, Bjela\u0161nica,  Cavljak - Barice, all featured tournaments on an international level. Unexploded ordnance is one of the reasons for slow development of this sport in a country with a such great potential for it.\n\n\n=== Canada ===\nCanada is famous for its downhill racing as well as other sorts of mountain biking. The Whistler Mountain Bike Park in Whistler, British Columbia hosts the annual Crankworx and Joyride Huckfest racing events. The province of British Columbia is also home to several other large lift-serviced mountain bike parks, including Sun Peaks in Kamloops, BC, Silver Star Mountain Resort in Vernon, BC, Kicking Horse Mountain Resort in Golden, BC and Fernie Alpine Resort. The North Shore Mountains of North Vancouver, BC, are a famous downhill biking destination in their own right. The popular style of technical downhill freeriding that involves many man-made trail elements originated here. The style is often referred to as \"North Shore Style.\"\nCanada has produced many world-class mountain bike racers, including downhillers Andrew Shandro and Steve Smith. The mount of Bromont, situated in Bromont, Quebec, and Mont-Sainte-Anne near Quebec City are great places for downhill biking.\n\n\n=== Croatia ===\n\nDownhill MTB races have been held in Croatia since 1993, when the first competition was organized outside Zagreb, on the same mountain that today hosts the world cup races in alpine skiing. Until the past 4\u20135 years, Mountain biking was banished from popular hiking trails and ski slopes around the capital. However, with the rise in popularity of DH and enduro, (gravity) riding, Trail management regulations have been relaxed and along with allowing riders, have begun to allow for development of MTB specific trails, cooperating with the local riding community to communicate which trails are acceptable and which are not. Additionally, the area known as 'Grma' has seen the growth and development of DH specific trails. MTB DH riding has also flourished in other parts of Croatia, especially in the northern Adriatic coastal region and in the northern (continental) part of country. In 2010 the national DH Cup events were held in Buzet (Istria), Samobor (Zagreb area), Pakrac (Slavonia) and Gracisce (Pazin, Istria). Additionally, multiple enduro races around the country are now part of an annual 'Cro-enduro' series and the fall of 2017 saw organization of the first ever Croatian Enduro National Championships. Urban downhill events are also held in the coastal city of Rijeka. 2018 saw the first UCI Mountain Bike World Cup held in Croatia, on the island of Lo\u0161inj.\n\n\n=== France ===\n\nThe French Alps are home to many downhill routes and events. The most famous of which is the Mega Avalanche downhill race event in the Alp d'Huez and Bourg d'Oisans region. Another downhill course in the region is Les Deux Alpes which sometimes hosts other downhill events. The downhill courses and events are limited in the area however, because of the alpine winter and snow.\nThe most popular area for downhill in the French alps is the Portes du Soleil including the two more popular resorts of Morzine and Les Gets. Most recently, a world cup was held for the first time in La Bresse. In August 2011, La Bresse hosted the sixth round of the UCI World Cup. Since 2015, Lourdes hosted a World Cup round each year.\n\n\n=== Georgia ===\nThe first downhill trails in Georgia were developed in 2015. Among the first built was in Gudauri, followed by trails in Bakuriani. Both of the places are also ski resorts. Trails are at 2000\u20132250 meters, with trail lengths of about 5000 meters.\n\n\n=== Germany ===\nIn Germany the landscape is quite diverse, reaching from flatlands in the north to medium-sized mountains in the center to alpine mountains in the south. Downhill tracks in Germany are not as steep as in Switzerland, Austria or Canada and the difference from top to bottom is less, but the main parts of an average track are everywhere in Germany. Racing on these short tracks is highly intense and allows no mistakes. Due to the country's large population the sport has developed quickly in Germany. Number of riders can go up to 600 at races. With 3 cup races, Thuringia, in the middle of Germany, is the center of gravity riding. The most popular race series is the 'iXS German Downhill Cup'. In Germany is the Europe's biggest Mountainbike Freeride Festival hold, called iXS Dirt Masters. It includes one iXS German Downhill Cup Round, a 4X Race and a slopestyle contest. It is visited by around 25000 spectators and 1200 riders. In the small town Willingen is a former World Cup Downhill and Four Cross Race Course. The World Cup has been held there in 2005 and 2006.\nWith Germany being a high level industry country, there are many firms producing downhill bikes, such as Last Bikes, Zonenschein, Fusion Bikes, Cube Bikes, Ghost Bikes, Canyon Bikes, Propain Bikes, Rose Bikes, Solid Bikes as well as boutique bike manufacturers Nicolai and Liteville. There are also a lot of firms producing high-end parts like Rohloff, Magura or Tune.\n\n\n=== India ===\n\nDownhill Mountain Biking in India is fairly new. The main and the most popular downhill mountain bike race in India is called Himalayan Downhill Mountain Bike Trophy which is organized by Himalayan Mountain Bike Network during Himalayan Mountain Bike Festival. This race is conducted at Ski Himalayas Ropeway and Ski Resort located in Solang Valley near Manali which the Mountain Biking Capital of India. The DH race track is 2 km long and the area offers lot of natural mountain biking trails and lends itself to many styles of mountain biking. The trails in this Himalayan region are accessible to riders of all skill levels.\n\n\n=== Ireland ===\nDownhill cycling has increased in Ireland over the past 10 years, for example, the National Points Series rounds regularly attract over 250 riders from all over the country. Irish tracks vary greatly in length and difficulty. Moneyscalp is one of the shorter tracks with times for Elites coming at just over a minute. Other tracks such as Carrick in Co.Wicklow are closer to 5 minutes. There are no official downhill tracks in the Republic of Ireland. Just across the border in Rostrevor, Northern Ireland however, Newry & Mourne District Council has recently built some tracks in Kilbroney Forest which includes a 27 km and 17 km single track and 2 purpose-built downhill trails.\nAccording to the law it is illegal to ride in the forests. All the tracks are built and maintained voluntarily by individuals and mountain biking clubs who take it upon themselves to do so. As downhill mountain biking has become more popular so has the call for more facilities and practitioners of this sport have begun campaigning with the state on this issue.\n\n\n=== Italy ===\nBardonecchia, one of the Torino 2006 winter olympic venues, converts some of its ski courses and lifts for use by mountain bikers in the summer, and a number of downhill courses are present. Other ski resorts turning to mountain bike parks in summer are Canazei, Pila, Sestola and Livigno. The area of Finale Ligure, near Genoa, offers year-round tracks that end on the seaside, served by shuttles. Among the most famous tracks in the country is the Sanremo Downhill, a rocky, technical and dangerous course won in 2007 by Fabien Barel. The 2008 World Championship were held in Val di Sole.\n\n\n=== Kazakhstan ===\nLocated in Tian Shan, city of Almaty, Shymbulak bike park was opened in 2013. There is also the Charyn canyons and mini RedBull Rampage trail. The cheap living costs, warm climate and fresh mountain air make Almaty a \"must visit\" place for riders on a budget.\n\n\n=== Latvia ===\nIn global context there are very little notable downhill venues in Latvia. Most of them are located at local ski resorts in Baldone, Sigulda and C\u0113sis, also there's trail network in the forests of Tukums near Melnezers. All the tracks are built and maintained voluntarily by individuals who take it upon themselves to do so. Each year Latvian Downhill association regularly schedule National downhill cup and championships. In the next several years it is expected to grow local community around downhill mountain biking by increasing the number of riders and improving local ski resort trail quality.\n\n\n=== Norway ===\nHafjell, a ski resort in the county of Oppland and host of the alpine skiing events (giant slalom and slalom) at the 1994 Winter Olympics, offers a wide variety of courses and tracks for cross country and downhill mountain bikers during summer. Hafjell hosted the 2010 European downhill championships and the 2010 Nordic downhill championships.\n\n\n=== Philippines ===\nPhilippines is known for its mountainous range and rocky hills. In Rizal, there are famous downhill tracks such as the Antenna Downhill Tracks in Binangonan and the Patiis Downhill Tracks in San Mateo. There are also other downhill tracks around the country that holds annual downhill races. Some notable Downhill athletes in Philippines are Parabanne Mendoza, Eleazar Barba Jr.,and Ni\u00f1o Martin Eday. The Downhill Riders Organization of the Philippines (DROP) organizes some of the downhill races around the country.\n\n\n=== Portugal ===\nPortugal is the host country of a unique variety of downhill races, the Urban Downhill, known as Downtown. Lisbon DownTown is a very popular annual event which brings world class Downhill athletes to Portugal, Steve Peat is the King of the race winning 8 of the 11 editions.\nThe Gouveia International Downhill is another important annual race that normally brings some of the WorldCup racers to the country.\nPlaces like Lous\u00e3, Tarouca and Sintra offer a big variety of single tracks and Downhill circuits.\n\n\n=== Russia ===\nSome of the notable Russian downhill venues are ski-complex \"Metallurg\" (Bannoe lake, Magnitogorsk), Mashuk and Chaget mountains. And in the city of Novosibirsk has a trail for such races. It is located in the CHP-5.\n\n\n=== Slovenia ===\n\nSlovenia's vast hilly landscape and undamaged nature makes very good conditions for downhill cycling, thus one of the world's top, not only tracks but riders are also in Slovenia. The famous tracks that are included in the world cup are at ski resort Kranjska Gora in north-west tip of Slovenia, while the other track is on ski resort hill Pohorje at Slovenia's second largest city Maribor.\n\n\n=== South Africa ===\nDownhill racing is not currently a very big sport in South Africa, but is rapidly growing. South Africa boasts some great tracks and riders, especially from the Western Cape and the Pietermaritzburg area in Kwa-Zulu Natal, the hometown of Greg Minnaar. In the Western Cape, the best tracks are Edeouth and Jonkershoek in Stellenbosch, Playgrounds in Paarl, Sir Lowry's Pass near Somerset-West (hometown of Andrew and Jonty Neethling), Zevenwacht near Kuilsriver and Witfontein in George. They provide quite technical, but fun courses. Ferncliff and World's View are great in Pietermaritzburg. Helderkruin (West of Johannesburg), Klapperkop in Pretoria and Gillooly's Farm in Johannesburg. South Africa held the first round of the 2009 UCI World Cup, which was in Pietermaritzburg (Greg Minnaar's hometown).\n\n\n=== Sweden ===\nWith the Caledonian mountains forming the borderland with Norway this country has places to downhill race. The majority of Sweden's notable downhill tracks are situated around \u00c5re and \u00c5re Bike, accessible via lift shuttles. In 1999 \u00c5re was the host for the UCI Mountain Bike & Trials World Championships and it hosted the Nordic Championships in 2007. There are numerous graded biking trails down the \u00c5reskutan fell.\nSweden's most southerly DH bike park is called Vall\u00e5sen Bike Park and is located on the north side of the Halland ridge between Sk\u00e5ne and Halland. Vall\u00e5sen opened in 2008 and attracts riders not only from Sweden but also Denmark due to its relatively close location to Copenhagen. Vall\u00e5sen holds an annual DH race at the end of the season called the Vall\u00e5sen DH Challenge.\nJarvs\u00f6 Bike Park is another downhill park, which is located in the locality of J\u00e4rvs\u00f6, in the municipality of Ljusdal approximately 3 hours north of Stockholm by car. The park consists of 17 tracks of varying difficulty, and a pumptrack.\n\n\n=== Switzerland ===\nLocated between the Alps and the Jura and surrounded by the downhill nations of France, Germany, Italy and Austria it is kind of a center for the European downhill scene. There are tracks in or near every city with high quality and a steep descent. It has several World Cup tracks like \"Champ\u00e9ry\" or \"Portes du Soleil\". Switzerland is the home of parts manufacturer DT Swiss,  EDCO Swiss bicycle components since 1902, frame manufacturer BMC and bike manufacturer Redalp.\n\n\n=== Thailand ===\nMountainous regions of Northern Thailand offer great venues for downhill mountain biking. Chiang Mai is the most famous location for downhill mountain biking in Thailand. The Chiang Mai Downhill Challenge, which were held in November 2012 and 2013 had attracted World Cup riders, such as Steve Peat, Josh Bryceland, Sam Dale, Brook Macdonald, Wyn Masters and Edward Masters, as well as a Belgian freerider, Nico Vink. Doi Suthep mountain is where most downhill actions take place in Chiang Mai. Tour operator, such as X-Biking Chiang Mai offers guided tour or shuttle service to the trailheads and pick up the riders once they complete the trails. The Thailand National Championships, which are held in many different venues across Thailand by the Thai Cycling Association also attract many riders across Southeast Asia. The cheap living costs, great foods, warm climate and great ridings make Thailand a \"must visit\" place for riders on a budget.\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n\nWithin the UK most of the main downhill tracks are in the Scottish Uplands, Highlands, Wales and Northern England, as these are more mountainous areas. Fort William in Scotland is Britain's only World Cup standard track and was the venue for the 2007 World Championships. The UK has a strong race scene with a national series and numerous regional series with strong representation of all age groups present. The country has produced many of the world's top downhill mountain bikers including Steve Peat, Gee Atherton, Danny Hart, Josh Bryceland, Brendan Fairclough, Rachel Atherton, Manon Carpenter and Tahnee Seagrave.\n\n\n=== United States ===\nThe Sea Otter Classic, held each April at Laguna Seca near Monterey, California, is a major riding event that opens the racing season. In 2008, experienced racer Mark Reynolds died after a crash at the Sea Otter Classic, highlighting the dangers of the sport. Plattekill Mountain in the Catskills, Mammoth Mountain, the Northstar at Tahoe, Brian Head Resort, Attitash and Deer Valley ski resorts, and Moab (Utah) are also well known to mountain bikers. Snowmass, Colorado is also developing as a location for the sport.\nMountain Creek Bike Park in Vernon, New Jersey is a downhill venue which hosts their own series of competitions called the Gravity Series. In the southeastern United States, Snowshoe Mountain is well known for its extensive mountain bike park, camps, and freeriding areas during the summer. Bryce Resort offers a self-described progression based bike park, built by Gravity Logic. Massanutten Resort also has a bike park with some of the most rocky terrain on the east coast. UCI Pro Downhill riders, Neko Mulally and Dakota Norton have built, train at, and promoted races Windrock Bike Park in Oliver Springs, Tennessee as well.\nVail, Colorado was the site of the 1994 Downhill World Championship.  The trail was renamed \"'94 Downhill\", and is still ridden by downhill bikers today. In 2006, The U.S. National Championships were held at the Infineon Raceway in Sonoma, California. In 2007 and 2008 the U.S. National Championships were held in Mt. Snow, Vermont, and in 2009 and 2010 the U.S. National Championships were held at SolVista Bike Park in Colorado.\n\n\n=== Venezuela ===\nEl Volcan, a small mountain in the southeastern, touristic El Hatillo Municipality of Caracas, has a Downhill course that has about 500 meters of vertical drop, it is used by hundreds of riders a day during dry and wet weather, mostly on weekends. El Volcan is the representative [Downhill] Track of Caracas city. The course is open to the public and riding is neither specifically allowed nor prohibited by law. The trails are also used by hikers all week long. Shuttles are about 10 Venezuelan bolivars per trip, they run from the parking lot of a Farmatodo drug store in La Boyera, up to the summit using public avenues and paved roads, taking from 15 minutes to 30 minutes depending on traffic on the area. The course apart from being used mostly for recreational purpose, also has been used for irregularly scheduled downhill races due to the lack of organization in the riders community.\n\n\n== Governing bodies ==\nThe Union Cycliste Internationale is the governing body for downhill mountain bike racing.  Racers qualify to compete in World Cup races by earning UCI points, which are gained by being a top ten finisher in certain races, usually national.\nIn the U.S., NORBA, as part of USA Cycling, runs the National Mountain Bike Series, and the NCCA is the governing body for collegiate cycling.  In the UK, British Cycling controls mountain biking as well as road and BMX. In Australia, MTBA controls all disciplines of Mountain biking.\n\n\n== Notable riders ==\n\n\n=== Men ===\nGee Atherton\nDan Atherton\nFabien Barel\nWade Bootes\nJoe Breeze\nTroy Brosnan\nLo\u00efc Bruni\nJosh Bryceland\nEric Carter\nC\u00e9dric Gracia\nAaron Gwin\nMichael Hannah\nDanny Hart\nCorrado H\u00e9rin\nSam Hill\nFinn Iles\nMike King\nMatti Lehikoinen\nBrian Lopes\nGreg Minnaar\nSteve Peat\nNathan Rennie\nRoger Rinderknecht\nLuca Shaw\nSteve Smith\nJohn Tomac\nLoris Vergier\nNicolas Vouilloz\nJake Watson\nJoost Wichman\n\n\n=== Women ===\nRachel Atherton\nAnneke Beerten\nManon Carpenter\nAnne-Caroline Chausson\nLeigh Donovan\nMissy Giove\nNiki Gudex\nTracey Hannah\nValentina H\u00f6ll\nJana Hor\u00e1kov\u00e1\nTara Llanes\nTracy Moseley\nMyriam Nicole\nTahn\u00e9e Seagrave\n\n\n== See also ==\nDownhill bike\nMountain bike\nMountain biking\nMountain bike racing\nBicycle suspension\nGlossary of cycling\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nKlunkerz: a film about mountain bikes at IMDb", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/2016-05-01_10-10-08_enduro-du-lion-belfort.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Brendon_Fairclough_%27Brendog%27_at_Fort_William_2017.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Charyn_Canyon_2019.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Finn_Iles_Losinj_WC_2018.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Himachal_Downhill_Mountain_Bike_Trophy_2014.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/MTB_downhill_18_Stevage.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/MTB_downhill_19_Stevage.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/27/MTB_downhill_21_Stevage.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Mountain_biking.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Mountain_biking_Downhill.webm", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Mountain_biking_Ladahk%2C_India_43037992_624b2b553f.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Sarajevo_urban_downhill_race.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/53/Shuttle_traffic_%28MTB%29.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg"], "summary": "{| align=\"right\" border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\"\n|-valign=\"top\"\n|-\n\n|\n|}\n\nDownhill mountain biking (DH) is a genre of mountain biking practiced on steep, rough terrain that often features jumps, drops, rock gardens and other obstacles.\nDownhill bikes are heavier and stronger than other mountain bikes and feature front and rear suspension with over 8 inches (20 cm) of travel, to glide quickly over rocks and tree roots.

Both may also be referred to as nudism. Though the two terms are largely interchangeable, nudism emphasizes the practice of nudity, whereas naturism highlights an attitude favoring harmony with nature and respect for the environment, into which that practice is integrated. That said, naturists come from a range of philosophical and cultural backgrounds; there is no single naturist ideology.\nEthical or philosophical nudism has a long history, with many advocates of the benefits of enjoying nature without clothing. At the turn of the 20th century, organizations emerged to promote social nudity and to establish private campgrounds and resorts for that purpose. Since the 1960s, with the acceptance of public places for clothing-optional recreation, individuals who do not identify themselves as naturists or nudists have been able to casually participate in nude activities. Nude recreation opportunities vary widely around the world, from isolated places known mainly to locals to officially-designated nude beaches and parks.\n\n\n== Definition and lexicology ==\nThe XIV Congress of the International Naturist Federation (INF) held at Agde, France, in 1974 defined naturism as:\n...a way of life in harmony with nature characterised by the practice of communal nudity with the intention of encouraging self-respect, respect for others and for the environment.\nMany contemporary naturists and naturist organisations advocate that the practice of social nudity should not be linked with sexual activity. Some recent studies show that naturism can help grow self-esteem, and thus have a positive impact on having a well-balanced sexuality, too. For various social, cultural, and historical reasons, the lay public, the media, and many contemporary naturists and their organisations have or present a simplified view of the relationship between naturism and sexuality. Current research has begun to explore this complex relationship.The International Naturist Federation explains:\nEach country has its own kind of naturism, and even each club has its own special character, for we too, human beings, have each our own character which is reflected in our surroundings.\nThe usage and definition of these terms varies geographically and historically. Naturism and nudism have the same meaning in the United States, but there is a clear distinction between the two terms in Great Britain.In naturist parlance, the terms \"textile\" or \"textilist\" refer to non-naturist persons, behaviours or facilities (e.g. \"the textile beach starts at the flag\", \"they are a mixed couple \u2013 he is naturist, she is textile\").  \"Textile\" is the predominant term used in the UK (\"textilist\" is unknown in British naturist magazines, including H&E naturist), although some naturists avoid using this term due to perceived negative or derogatory connotations. \"Textilist\" is said to be used interchangeably with \"textile\", but no dictionary definition to this effect exists, nor are there any equivalent examples of use in mainstream literature such as those for textile.\n\n\n== Naturist places and events ==\n\nSome naturists only practice naturism at special events, some only at private clubs or designated beaches, and some only at home. Most, however, will practice their chosen lifestyle wherever and whenever it is convenient and appropriate.\n\n\n=== Naturist facilities ===\n\nAt naturist organised events or venues, clothing is usually optional. At naturist swimming pools or sunbathing places, however, complete nudity is expected (weather permitting). This rule is sometimes a source of controversy among naturists. Staff at a naturist facility are usually required to be clothed due to health and safety regulations.Facilities for naturists are classified in various ways. A landed or members' naturist club is one that owns its own facilities. Non-landed (or travel) clubs meet at various locations, such as private residences, swimming pools, hot springs, landed clubs and resorts, or rented facilities. Landed clubs can be run by members on democratic lines or by one or more owners who make the rules. In either case, they can determine membership criteria and the obligations of members. This usually involves sharing work necessary to maintain or develop the site.\n\nThe international naturist organizations were mainly composed of representatives of landed clubs. Nudist colony is no longer a favored term, and can be used by naturists to address landed clubs that have rigid non-inclusive membership criteria.\nA holiday centre is a facility that specializes in providing apartments, chalets and camping pitches for visiting holidaymakers. A center is run commercially, and visitors are not members and have no say in the management. Most holiday centers expect visitors to hold an INF card (that is, to belong to an INF-affiliated organization), but some have relaxed this requirement, relying on the carrying of a trade card. Holiday centers vary in size. Larger holiday centres may have swimming pools, sports pitches, an entertainment program, kids' clubs, restaurants and supermarkets. Some holiday centres allow regular visitors to purchase their own chalets, and generations of the same families may visit each year. Holiday centres are more tolerant of clothing than members-only clubs; total nudity is usually compulsory in the swimming pools and may be expected on the beaches, while on the football pitches, or in the restaurants in the evening, it is rare.A naturist resort is, to a European, a private property with accommodation and facilities where naturism is the norm. Centre Helio-Marin in Vendays Montalivet, Aquitaine, France (the first naturist resort, established in 1950); the naturist village of Charco del Palo on Lanzarote, Canary Islands; Vera Playa in Spain; and Vritomartis Resort in Greece are examples.\nIn US usage, a naturist resort can mean a holiday centre. Freik\u00f6rperkultur (FKK)\u2014literally translated as 'free body culture'\u2014is the name for the general movement in Germany. The abbreviation is also recognised outside of Germany and can be found on informal signs indicating the direction to a remote naturist beach.\n\n\n=== Nude beaches ===\n\nIn some European countries, such as Denmark, all beaches are clothing optional, while in others like Germany (and experimentally in France) there are naturist sunbathing areas in public parks (e.g., in Munich and Berlin). Beaches in some holiday destinations, such as Crete, are also clothing optional, except some central urban beaches. There are two centrally located clothes-optional beaches in Barcelona. Sweden allows nudity on all beaches.In a survey by The Daily Telegraph, Germans and Austrians were most likely to have visited a nude beach (28%), followed by Norwegians (18%), Spaniards (17%), Australians (17%), and New Zealanders (16%). Of the nationalities surveyed, the Japanese (2%) were the least likely to have visited a nude beach. This result may indicate the lack of nude beaches in Japan; however, the Japanese are open with regard to family bathing nude at home and at onsens (hot springs).\n\n\n=== Festival naturism ===\nFrom Woodstock to Edinburgh, and Nambassa in the southern hemisphere, communal nudity can be seen at music and counterculture festivals.The Nambassa hippie festivals held in New Zealand in the late 1970s were examples of non-sexual naturism. Of the 75,000 patrons who attended the 1979 Nambassa three-day festival, an estimated 35% of attendees spontaneously chose to remove their clothing, preferring complete or partial nudity.\n\nSome nudist festivals are held to celebrate particular days of the year, and activities may include nude bodypainting. One example is the Neptune Day Festival held in Koktebel, Crimea, to depict mythological events. Another is the Festival Nudista Zipolite organized by the Federaci\u00f3n Nudista de M\u00e9xico (Mexican Nudist Federation) held annually since 2016 on the first weekend of February.A few camps organize activities in the nude, such as oil wrestling by camp Gymnasium.\n\n\n=== Summer naturism ===\nNaturism tends to be more common during the warmer summer months. \nSome regions host first-time naturists and people who have recently started to practice the naturist lifestyle.\nOne study noted that some of these people are seasonal naturists who wear clothes during other times of the year.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nNudity in social contexts has been practised in various forms by many cultures and in all time periods. In modern Western society, social nudity is most frequently encountered in the contexts of bathing, swimming and in saunas, whether in single-sex groups, within the family, or with mixed-sex friends, but throughout history and in many contemporary tropical cultures, nudity is a norm at many sports events and competitions.The first known use of the word naturisme occurred in 1778. A French-speaking Belgian, Jean Baptiste Luc Planchon (1734\u20131781), used the term to advocate nudism as a means of improving the hygi\u00e8ne de vie or healthy living.The earliest known naturist club in the western sense of the word was established in British India in 1891. The Fellowship of the Naked Trust was founded by Charles Edward Gordon Crawford, a widower who was a District and Sessions Judge for the Bombay Civil Service. The commune was based in Matheran and had just three members at the beginning: Crawford and two sons of an Anglican missionary, Andrew and Kellogg Calderwood. The commune fell apart when Crawford was transferred to Ratnagiri; he died soon after in 1894.\n\nIn 1902, a series of philosophical papers was published in Germany by Dr. Heinrich Pudor under the pseudonym Heinrich Scham, who coined the term Nacktkultur. In 1906 he went on to write a three-volume treatise with his new term as its title, which discussed the benefits of nudity in co-education and advocated participating in sports while being free of cumbersome clothing. Richard Ungewitter (Nacktheit, 1906, Nackt, 1908, etc.) proposed that combining physical fitness, sunlight, and fresh air bathing, and then adding the nudist philosophy, contributed to mental and psychological fitness, good health, and an improved moral-life view. Major promoters of these ideas included Adolf Koch and Hans Suren. Germany published the first journal of nudism between 1902 and 1932.The wide publication of those papers, and others, contributed to an explosive worldwide growth of nudism in which nudists participated in various social, recreational, and physical fitness activities in the nude. The first organized club for nudists on a large scale, Freilichtpark (Free-Light Park), was opened near Hamburg in 1903 by Paul Zimmerman.\nIn 1919, German doctor Kurt Huldschinsky discovered that exposure to sunlight helped to cure rickets in many children, causing sunlight to be associated with improved health.\n\nIn France in the early 20th century, the brothers Gaston and Andr\u00e9 Durville, both physicians, studied the effects of psychology, nutrition, and environment on health and healing. They became convinced of the importance of natural foods and the natural environment on human well-being and health. They named this concept in French: naturisme. The profound effect of clean air and sunlight on human bodies became evident to them and so nudity became a part of their naturism.Naturism became a more widespread phenomenon in the 1920s in Germany, the United Kingdom, France and other European countries and spread to the United States where it became established in the 1930s.By 1951, the various national federations united to form the International Naturist Federation. Some naturists preferred not to join clubs, and after 1945, pressure arose to designate beaches for naturist use.\nFrom the middle of the 20th century, with changing leisure patterns, commercial organisations began opening holiday resorts to attract naturists who expected the same \u2013 or better \u2013 standards of comfort and amenity offered to non-naturists. More recently, naturist holiday options have expanded to include cruises.In the early 21st century many organised clubs saw a decline in attendance by young people, which worried many naturists about the future of the movement. The clubs' aging memberships may have put younger people off joining in a vicious circle of decline. A rise in social conservatism, re-asserting a nudity taboo, may have also contributed to the decline. However, since tolerance for nudity in general is increasing over time, and is higher among younger generations, an alternative hypothesis is that younger naturists no longer feel they need to join a club or visit a resort in order to practise naturism. Active recruitment of younger members is being pursued by some organisations. The phenomenon varies by country, with, for example, naturism in France experiencing steady growth in a younger demographic during the 2010s.\n\n\n== Writers ==\nNaturism was part of a literary movement in the late 1800s (see the writings of Andr\u00e9 Gide) that also influenced the art movements of the time, specifically Henri Matisse and other Fauve painters. This movement was based on the French concept of joie de vivre, the idea of reveling freely in physical sensations and direct experiences and a spontaneous approach to life.\nHeinrich Pudor wrote on methods to improve social hygiene in his book Nackende Menschen und Jauchzen der Zukunft (Naked people and the future of Mankind) and then Nacktkultur (Nude Culture). It prescribes an austere lifestyle and nudity.\nPaul Zimmermann opened the Freilicht Park in L\u00fcbeck which was open to those who subscribed to Nacktkultur principles.\nRichard Ungewitter wrote Die Nacktheit (Nakedness) which sold 90,000 copies, prescribed a similar Utopian lifestyle, where everyone would be nude, eat only vegetables and abstain from alcohol and tobacco. In his Utopia, everyone was to be Germanic with blue eyes and blonde hair.\nAdolf Koch, a left-wing primary-school teacher, sought to use social nudity to free the people from \"authority fixated conditioning which held proletarians in deference of their masters: parental authority, paternalism of the church, the mass media and organs of law and order.\" He used Organic-Rhythmic exercises in Berlin schools in the 1920s. In 1932 there were about 100,000 Germans involved with naturism, of which 70,000 were in Koch's K\u00f6rpersch\u00fclen schools.\nHans Sur\u00e9n taught nude gymnastics to soldiers for five years, and on being forced to leave the army, he wrote (in 1924) Mensch und die Sonne (Men and the Sun) which ran to 61 reprints.\nAmerican writers Walt Whitman and Henry David Thoreau both wrote of nudity within the natural environment.\n\n\n== Health ==\nNaturist activities can have positive psychological benefits including greater life satisfaction, more positive body image, and higher self-esteem. Social nudity leads to acceptance in spite of differences in age, body shape, fitness, and health.\n\n\n== Religion ==\n\nChristian naturism includes various members associated with most denominations. Although beliefs vary, a common theme is that much of Christianity has misinterpreted the events regarding the Garden of Eden, and that God was displeased with Adam and Eve for covering their bodies with fig leaves.\n\n\n== Europe ==\n \nIn most European countries, nudity is not explicitly forbidden. Whether it is tolerated on beaches which are not marked as official nudist beaches varies greatly. The only country with substantially different laws is Denmark, where beach nudity is explicitly allowed on all beaches, except for two in the far west of the country.\n\n\n=== Belgium ===\nOrganized naturism in Belgium began in 1924 when engineer Joseph-Paul Swenne founded the Belgian League of Heliophilous Propaganda (usually abbreviated to H\u00e9lios) in Uccle near Brussels. This was followed four years later by De Spar, founded by Jozef Geertz and hosted on the country estate of entrepreneur Oswald Johan de Schampelaere. Belgian naturism was influenced in equal part by French naturism and German Freik\u00f6rperkultur. Today Belgian naturists are represented by the Federatie van Belgische Naturisten (FBN).\n\n\n=== Croatia ===\n\nCroatia is world-famous for naturism, which accounts for about 15% of its tourism industry. It was also the first European country to develop commercial naturist resorts. During a 1936 Adriatic cruise, King Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson stopped at a beach on the island of Rab where King Edward obtained a special permission from the local government to swim naked, thereby designating it the world's first official nude beach.\n\n\n=== Finland ===\n\nIn Finnish culture, nudism is considered to be a relatively normal way to live. It is not uncommon to see entire families spending time together naked. Families may be naked while bathing in a sauna, swimming in a pool, or playing on a beach, and it's not unusual to see children playing naked in a family yard for example. Nudity as a whole is considered less taboo than in many other countries.\n\n\n=== France ===\n\nMarcel Kienn\u00e9 de Mongeot is credited with starting naturism in France in 1920. His family had suffered from tuberculosis, and he saw naturism as a cure and a continuation of the traditions of the ancient Greeks. In 1926 he started the magazine Vivre int\u00e9gralement (later called Vivre) and the first French naturist club, Sparta Club, at Garambouville, near Evreux. The court action that he initiated established that nudism was legal on private property that was fenced and screened.Drs. Andr\u00e9 and Gaston Durville bought 70 hectares (170 acres) on the \u00cele du Levant where they established the village of H\u00e9liopolis, which was open to the public. In 1925 Dr Fran\u00e7ois Fougerat de David de Lastours wrote a thesis on heliotherapy, and in that year opened the Club gymnique de France. In 1936 the naturist movement was officially recognised.Albert and Christine Lecocq were active members of many of these clubs, but they left after disagreements and in 1944 founded the Club du Soleil with members in 84 cities. Four years later they founded the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise de Naturisme (FFN); in 1949 they started the magazine, Vie au Soleil; and in 1950 they opened the CHM Montalivet, the world's first naturist holiday centre, where the INF was formed.\n\n\n=== Germany ===\n\nGerman naturism (Freik\u00f6rperkultur, FKK) was part of the Lebensreform movement and the Wandervogel youth movement of 1896, from Steglitz, Berlin, which promoted ideas of fitness and vigour. At the same time, doctors of the Natural Healing Movement were using heliotherapy, treating diseases such as tuberculosis, rheumatism, and scrofula with exposure to sunlight.Nacktkultur, a term coined in 1903 by Heinrich Pudor, connected nudity, vegetarianism and social reform, and was practised in a network of 200 members clubs. The movement gained prominence in the 1920s by offering a health giving life-style with Utopian ideals. Germany published the first naturist journal between 1902 and 1932, but it became politicised by radical socialists who believed it would lead to classlessness and a break down of society. It eventually became associated with pacificism.In 1926, Adolf Koch established a school of naturism in Berlin, encouraging a mixing of the sexes, open air exercises, and a programme of \"sexual hygiene\". In 1929 the Berlin school hosted the first International Congress on Nudity.After World War II, East Germans were free to practice naturism, chiefly at beaches rather than clubs (private organizations were regarded as potentially subversive). Naturism became a large element in DDR politics. The Proletarische Freik\u00f6rperkulturbewegung subsection of the Workers Sports Organisation had 60,000 members. Since reunification there are many clubs, parks and beaches open to naturists, though nudity has become less common in the former eastern zone. Germans are typically the most commonly seen visitors at nude beaches in France and around Europe.\n\n\n=== Greece ===\nPublic nudity is prohibited in Greece and there are no official nude beaches. There are, however, numerous unofficial nude beaches especially on the islands frequented by tourists, like Crete, Mykonos or Karpathos, and also on smaller islands like Skopelos or Skiathos where nudity is tolerated, usually at the more remote ends or secluded areas of beaches.On the other hand, toplessness is not illegal and is widely practiced by locals and tourists alike as there are no cultural taboos against it.\n\n\n=== Italy ===\nPublic nudity is generally prohibited in Italy as a civil offence and can be punished with high fines (see the German Wikivoyage), with the exception of the official naturist beaches and places where there's a tradition of naturist attendance, as shown by a recent absolution sentence. Furthermore, in the recent decade, some regions have created laws to help the naturist tourism industry, and actually there are thirteen official naturist beaches in all Italy, where nudity is officially guaranteed by administrative acts. On all other public beaches in Italy, police can potentially impose substantial fines. On the other hand, female toplessness has been officially legalized (in a nonsexual context) in all public beaches and swimming pools throughout the country (unless otherwise specified by region, province or municipality by-laws) on March 20, 2000, when the Supreme Court of Cassation (through sentence No. 3557) has determined that the exposure of the nude female breast, after several decades, is now considered a \"commonly accepted behavior\", and therefore, has \"entered into the social costume\".\n\n\n=== Netherlands ===\nThe oldest Dutch naturist association is Zon en Leven (\"Sun and Life\"), founded in 1946 with the aim of promoting healthy physical and mental development and a natural way of life. The national association is Naturisten Federatie Nederland (NFN), which in 2017 adopted the new brand name Bloot Gewoon! (\"Simply Naked\") in an effort to become more accessible to casual naturists and strengthen the acceptance of nude recreation.In general, Dutch people are very tolerant of beach nudity, as long as it does not impact on others, or involve inappropriate staring or sexual behaviour. Topless sunbathing is permitted on most beaches except where prohibited by signage.\n\n\n=== Portugal ===\n\nThe Federa\u00e7\u00e3o Portuguesa de Naturismo (Portuguese Naturist Federation) or FPN was founded on 1 March 1977 in Lisbon. In the 21st century, naturism is considered a tolerated practice, whereas there are many officially-designated nudist beaches.\n\n\n=== Poland ===\n\nIn today's Poland naturism is practiced in number of the seaside and inland beaches. Most Polish beaches are actually clothing-optional rather than naturist. One such beach is Mi\u0119dzyzdroje-Lubiewo.\n\n\n=== Spain ===\n\nPublic nudity in Spain is not illegal since there is no law banning its practice. Spanish legislation foresees felony for exhibitionism but restricts its scope to obscene exposure in front of children or mentally impaired individuals, i.e. with sexual connotation. There are, however, some municipalities (like San Pedro del Pinatar) where public nudity has been banned by means of by-laws. Other municipalities (like Barcelona, Salou, Platja de Palma and Sant Antoni de Portmany) have used similar provisions to regulate partial nudity, requiring people to cover their torsos on the streets. Some naturist associations have appealed these by-laws on the grounds that a fundamental right (freedom of expression, as they understand nudism to be self-expression) cannot be regulated with such a mechanism. Some courts have ruled in favour of nudist associations. Nudism in Spain is normally practised by the seaside, on beaches or small coves with a tradition of naturism. In Vera (Andalusia), there is a wide residential area formed by nudist urbanisations. Nudist organisations may organise some activities elsewhere in inner territory.\nLegal provisions regarding partial nudity (or toplessness) are analogous to those regarding full nudity, but social tolerance towards toplessness is higher. The law does not require women to cover their breasts in public swimming, or on any beach in Spain. The governments of the municipalities of Galdakao and L'Ametlla del Vall\u00e8s legalized female toplessness on their public pools in March 2016 and June 2018, respectively.\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the first official nudist club was established in Wickford, Essex, in 1924. According to Michael Farrar, writing for British Naturism, the club adopted the name \"Moonella Group\" from the name of the owner of the ground and called its site The Camp. Moonella, who was still living in 1965 but whose identity remains to be discovered, had inherited a house with land in 1923 and made it available to certain members of the New Gymnosophy Society. This society was founded a few years before by H.C. Booth, M.H. Sorensen and Rex Wellbye under the name of the English Gymnosophical Society. It met for discussions at the Minerva Cafe at 144 High Holborn in London, the headquarters of the Women's Freedom League. Those who were permitted to join the Moonella Group were carefully selected, and the club was run by a leadership of the original members, all of whom had club names to preserve their anonymity. The club closed in 1926 because of construction on adjacent land.By 1943 there were a number of \"sun clubs\", and together they formed the British Sun Bathers Association, or BSBA. In 1954 a group of clubs unhappy with the way the BSBA was being run split to form the Federation of British Sun Clubs, or FBSC. In 1961, the BSBA Annual Conference agreed that the term nudist was inappropriate and should be discarded in favour of naturist. The two organisations rivalled each other before eventually coming together again in 1964 as the Central Council for British Naturism, or CCBN. This organisation structure has remained much the same but it is now called British Naturism, which is often abbreviated to BN.The first official nude beach was opened at Fairlight Glen in Covehurst Bay near Hastings in 1978 (not to be confused with Fairlight Cove, which is 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) to the east), followed later by the beaches at Brighton and Fraisthorpe. Bridlington opened in April 1980.\n\n\n== Oceania ==\n\n\n=== Australia ===\n\nAustralia's first naturist club was founded in Sydney in 1931 by the French-born anarchist and pacifist Kleber Claux. In 1975, the southern half of Maslin Beach, south of Adelaide, was declared Australia's first official nude beach. The beach is almost 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) long, so the area reserved for nude bathing is away from other beach users.\n\n\n=== New Zealand ===\n\nNudist clubs (called sun clubs) were established in Dunedin and Auckland in early 1938; the Auckland Sun Group went into recess shortly afterwards due to the outbreak of World War II. In 1958 the allied nudist clubs of New Zealand established the New Zealand Sunbathing Association, later renamed the New Zealand Naturist Federation. The Federation includes 17 affiliated clubs with a total membership (in 2012) of 1,600 people. In 2016 the Federation, in conjunction with Tourism New Zealand, hosted the World Congress of the International Naturist Federation at the Wellington Naturist Club, marking the second time the Congress had ever been held in the Southern Hemisphere.Outside formal naturist organizations, social nudity is practised in a variety of contexts in New Zealand culture. It is a feature of many summer music festivals, including Convergence, Kiwiburn, Luminate, Rhythm & Vines, and Splore, in a tradition going back to Nambassa in the late 1970s. It is also associated with the culture of rugby, most prominently in the nude rugby match held in Dunedin each winter from 2002 to 2014 (and sporadically thereafter) as pre-match entertainment for the first professional rugby game of the season, and in the mock public holiday \"National Nude Day\", an event in which viewers of the TV2 talk show SportsCafe were invited \u2013 chiefly by former rugby player Marc Ellis, the show's most irrepressibly comic presenter \u2013 to send in photos and video of themselves performing daily activities in the nude.While a large proportion of New Zealanders are tolerant of nudity, especially on beaches, there remains a contingent who consider it obscene. Naturists who engage in casual public nudity, even in places where this is lawful, risk being reported to police by disapproving people. Legally, nudity is permissible on any beach where it is \"known to occur\", in consequence of which New Zealand has no official nude beaches. The indecent exposure provision of the Summary Offences Act is, in practice, reserved for cases of public sexual gratification, but public nudity may still be prosecuted under the \"offensive behaviour\" provision.\n\n\n== North America ==\n\n\n=== Canada ===\n\nIn Canada individuals around the country became interested in nudism, skinny-dipping, and physical culture in the early part of the 20th century. Sunbathing & Health, a magazine targeted toward Canadian naturists and which occasionally carried local news, began publication after 1940. There were scattered groups of naturists in several cities during the 1930s and 1940s, and some of these groups attracted enough interest to form clubs on private land. The most significant clubs were the Van Tan Club, formed in 1939, which is still operating in North Vancouver, BC, and the Sun Air Club, in Ontario.\nCanadians who served in the military during the Second World War met like-minded souls from across the country, and often visited clubs while in Europe. They were a ready pool of recruits for post-war organizers. A few years later, the wave of post-war immigration brought many Europeans with their own extensive experience, and they not only swelled the ranks of membership, but often formed their own clubs, helping to expand nudism from coast to coast.Most clubs eventually united in the Canadian Sunbathing Association, which affiliated with the American Sunbathing Association in 1954. Several disagreements between eastern and western members of the CSA resulted in its division into the Western Canadian Sunbathing Association (WCSA) and the Eastern Canadian Sunbathing Association (ECSA) in 1960. The ECSA endured much in-fighting over the next fifteen years, which led to its official demise in 1978. The WCSA changed its name to the American Association for Nude Recreation \u2013 Western Canadian Region, a region of the American Association for Nude Recreation (AANR), which itself was formerly known as the ASA.In 1977 the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise de naturisme (FQN) was founded in Quebec by Michel Va\u00efs, who had experienced European naturism at Montalivet. In 1985 the Federation of Canadian Naturists (FCN) was formed with the support of the FQN. In 1988 the FQN and FCN formed the FQN-FCN Union as the official Canadian representative in the International Naturist Federation.\n\n\n=== Mexico ===\n\nFederaci\u00f3n Nudista de M\u00e9xico is a members organization with both individual and organization members.  It promotes social nudity in Mexico, and it is recognized by the International Naturist Federation as the official national naturist organization in that country.\nAs of 2016, Playa Zipolite is Mexico's first and only legal public nude beach. A free beach and unofficially nudist for more than 50 years, this beach is reputed to be the best place for nudism in the country. The numerous nude sunbathers, and the long tradition, make it safe for nudism and naturism.  Annually since 2016, on the first weekend of February, Zipolite has hosted Festival Nudista Zipolite that in 2019 attracted 7,000-8,000 visitors.\n\n\n=== United States ===\n\nKurt Barthel founded the American League for Physical Culture in 1929 and organized the first nudist event. In about 1930 they organized the American Gymnosophical Association. Barthel founded America's first official nudist camp, Sky Farm in New Jersey, in May, 1932. Around 1932, the AGA established the Rock Lodge Club as a nudist facility in Stockholm, New Jersey and Ilsley Boone, a Dutch Reformed minister, formed the Christian naturism movement. Naturism began to expand nationwide. Nudism venues were alcohol-free until 1970.The American Association for Nude Recreation (AANR) is the national naturist organization. Arnd Kr\u00fcger compared nudists in Germany and the United States and came to the conclusion that in Germany the racial aspects (Zuchtwahl) were important for the breakthrough (e.g. the Commanding General of the Army served as patron for nudists events), while in the U.S. nudism was far more commercial and had thus more difficulties.In 2008, Florida Young Naturists held their first Naked Bash, which has been repeated multiple times per year and has grown into one of the largest young naturist gatherings in the world.In 2009, a campaign to promote Nudism in the United States occurred with an effort by the AANR to record the largest simultaneous Skinny Dip at several U.S. Clubs and beaches, which occurred on July 11 of that year.In 2010, a new organization formed called Young Naturists and Nudists America, which was mostly focused around the younger generation, as well as social issues, such as body image. Young Naturists and Nudists America closed in 2017.\n\n\n== Asia ==\n\n\n=== Indonesia ===\nIn the seventies, nudity on Bali's remote and deserted beaches was common, but with the massive growth of tourism this practice has disappeared. In 2002, nudity was declared illegal on Petitenget Beach, the last beach in Seminyak that tolerated discreet nudity. Individuals began to practice nudity in private villas and resorts. Laki Uma Villa, the first naturist facility to open, was for gay men only. Bali au Naturel, the first adult-only nudist resort for both genders, opened its doors in 2004. It subsequently expanded from 3 to 15 rooms and added two more swimming pools.\nIndonesia has an underground naturist community who defy the laws against public nudity.\n\n\n=== Thailand ===\nNudism was successfully introduced in 2012 by The Thailand Naturist Association in Pattaya (Chan Resort), and five more nudist resorts have been created across Thailand: Barefeet Resort in Bangkok, Lemon Tree in Phuket, Oriental Village in Chiangmai, Phuan Naturist Village in Huay Yai, and Peace Blue Naturist resort in Phukett, all members of the Naturist Association of Thailand and other international naturist organizations.\n\n\n== Naturist media ==\n\n\n=== Magazines ===\nMagazines published by, for or purportedly about naturists can be grouped:\n\nMagazines published by an \"official\" national organisation, such as BN (British Naturism), Going Natural/Au naturel (FCN/FQN), Nude & Natural Magazine (The Naturist Society), gonatural (New Zealand Naturist Federation).\nIndependent magazines published for naturists, such as Naturally, H&E naturist and TAN (acronym of The Australian Naturist).\nMagazines that print photographs only or primarily of young female professional models, which are disapproved of by many naturists and non-naturists alike.Magazines in the second and, occasionally, third groups feature naturist editorial and advertising. While some naturists argue over which magazines belonged in which of these categories, these views may change as publishers and editors change. Many clubs and groups have benefited from magazines which, while not exclusively or even predominantly naturist in character, made naturist information available to many who would not otherwise have been aware of it. The information and advertising provided online, along with the wide availability of free online porn, has meant the disappearance of old-style \"skin\" magazines presenting significant glamour content masquerading as, or alongside, naturist content. Naturist magazines have to appeal strongly to naturists to succeed; they cannot sit on the fence between naturism and glamour. Some naturists feel that the worthwhile editorial content in some magazines is not a fair balance for the disapproved-of photographic content.\n\n\n=== Photography, films and videos ===\n\nAlthough photographing others when they are nude in a public place may not violate their rights to privacy, individuals retain the personality rights to their own image in many countries. If so, recognizable photographs of any person cannot be published without a permission.\nSome naturist clubs have been willing to allow filming by the media on their grounds, though content that proved not to be of genuine naturism can end up being parodied by the media as the norm.Some commercial 'naturist' DVDs are dominated by imagery of naked children. Such material can be marketed in ways that appear to appeal directly to paedophile inclinations, and ownership of these DVDs (and their earlier video cassette incarnations) has resulted in successful British prosecutions for possession of indecent images of children. One case was appealed, unsuccessfully, to the European Court of Human Rights. The precedents set by the court cases mean that possession in Britain of any naturist image of a child is, potentially, grounds for prosecution.\nPhoto shoots, including major high-profile works by Spencer Tunick, are done in public places including beaches.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Books ===\n\n\n=== Journal articles ===\n\n\n=== Newspaper articles ===\n\n\n=== Websites ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nCarr-Gomm, Philip (2013).

Both may also be referred to as nudism. Though the two terms are largely interchangeable, nudism emphasizes the practice of nudity, whereas naturism highlights an attitude favoring harmony with nature and respect for the environment, into which that practice is integrated. That said, naturists come from a range of philosophical and cultural backgrounds; there is no single naturist ideology.\nEthical or philosophical nudism has a long history, with many advocates of the benefits of enjoying nature without clothing. At the turn of the 20th century, organizations emerged to promote social nudity and to establish private campgrounds and resorts for that purpose. Since the 1960s, with the acceptance of public places for clothing-optional recreation, individuals who do not identify themselves as naturists or nudists have been able to casually participate in nude activities. Nude recreation opportunities vary widely around the world, from isolated places known mainly to locals to officially-designated nude beaches and parks."}, "Nude_psychotherapy": {"links": ["Public relations", "American Psychological Association", "Henry S.

It developed in the 1960s along with the encounter group movement as a way to challenge preconceptions and promote intimacy and trust, but suffered a decline in the 1980s. It is still used by some organizations that offer participatory workshops on intimacy, sex and love.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nIn 1932 a Princeton psychologist Howard Warren, who was president of the American Psychological Association, spent a week at a German nudist camp. A year later, he published a paper entitled Social Nudism and the Body Taboo, which was a largely sympathetic consideration of the social and psychological significance of nudism. Warren described nudism in therapeutic terms, pointing out its 'easy camaraderie' and lack of 'self-consciousness' . He noted an 'improvement in general health' among participants.  Other psychologists published further papers on the effect of nudity in the 1940s and 1950s.\n\n\n=== 1960s ===\nIn 1967, a group psychotherapist in California, Paul Bindrim, noticed that towards the end of a long period of group psychotherapy called a \"marathon\", the participants would be sufficiently open and trusting of each other to feel comfortable enough to be spontaneously naked in each other's company. Bindrim theorized that intentionally introducing nudity in the early stages of a group might accelerate the process of mutual trust and emotional openness. Bindrim corresponded with Abraham Maslow on the subject of nude psychotherapy groups, which Maslow, who was then-president of the American Psychological Association, supported. Maslow supported the idea stating he saw the social taboo on nudity to be a matter of custom rather than of any ethical or moral importance. Maslow warned that he thought discretion, sensitivity and caution would have to be present in any execution of the idea. Maslow later cautioned that the sensation of nudity and sensual pleasure should not be mistaken by participants for the genuine achievement of a psychological \"high\" and feared it might impede the development of real empathy between individuals.In 1967, Bindrim conducted his first nude workshop in Deer Park, California. There were typically 15 to 25 participants. Bindrim developed his nude encounter marathons into a weekend workshop using nudity and swimming pools, which was recorded in the 1971 documentary film entitled Out of Touch by the Canadian Film Board and produced by Bindrim. The American Psychological Association's Ethics Committee launched an investigation of Bindrim, reportedly prompted by conservative politicians. However,  due to the cultural climate of the late 1960s and the fact that the nudity was consensual, the  investigation was later dropped. Bindrim became increasingly sensitive to the public relations obstacle posed by the phrase \"nude psychotherapy\" causing him recast his approach and by the late 1970s his promotional materials made only a passing reference to nudity. With the change in psychotherapeutic fashion as the 1970s progressed, the decision was eventually made to remove the emphasis on nudity altogether. Other contemporary researchers found that social nudity is not the sexually-charged practice that convention imagines it to be.\n\n\n== Today ==\nThe Human Awareness Institute, an organization that offers participatory workshops on intimacy, sex and love continues to conduct group sessions in which the participants have the option to be naked.\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nBaring The Soul: Paul Bindrim, Abraham Maslow and 'Nude Psychotherapy'  by Ian Nicholson - full text, pdf", "images": [], "summary": "Nude psychotherapy is the use of non-sexual social nudity as an intentional means to improve the participant's psychological health.\nThe field began in the 1930s with psychological studies of the effects of social nudity on the lives of naturists.

Public relations (PR) and publicity differ in that PR is controlled internally, whereas publicity is not controlled and contributed by external parties. Public relations may include an organization or individual gaining exposure to their audiences using topics of public interest and news items that do not require direct payment. This differentiates it from advertising as a form of marketing communications. Public relations aims to create or obtain coverage for clients for free, also known as earned media, rather than paying for marketing or advertising. But in the early 21st century, advertising is also a part of broader PR activities.An example of good public relations would be generating an article featuring a PR firm's client, rather than paying for the client to be advertised next to the article. The aim of public relations is to inform the public, prospective customers, investors, partners, employees, and other stakeholders, and ultimately persuade them to maintain a positive or favorable view about the organization, its leadership, products, or political decisions. Public relations professionals typically work for PR and marketing firms, businesses and companies, government, and public officials as public information officers and nongovernmental organizations, and nonprofit organizations. Jobs central to public relations include account coordinator, account executive, account supervisor, and media relations manager.Public relations specialists establish and maintain relationships with an organization's target audience, the media, relevant trade media, and other opinion leaders. Common responsibilities include designing communications campaigns, writing press releases and other content for news, working with the press, arranging interviews for company spokespeople, writing speeches for company leaders, acting as an organization's spokesperson, preparing clients for press conferences, media interviews and speeches, writing website and social media content, managing company reputation (crisis management), managing internal communications, and marketing activities like brand awareness and event management. Success in the field of public relations requires a deep understanding of the interests and concerns of each of the company's many stakeholders. The public relations professional must know how to effectively address those concerns using the most powerful tool of the public relations trade, which is publicity.\n\n\n== Definitions ==\nIvy Lee, the man who turned around the Rockefeller name and image, and his friend, Edward Louis Bernays, established the first definition of public relations in the early 20th century as follows: \"a management function, which tabulates public attitudes, defines the policies, procedures and interests of an organization... followed by executing a program of action to earn public understanding and acceptance.\" However, when Lee was later asked about his role in a hearing with the United Transit Commission, he said \"I have never been able to find a satisfactory phrase to describe what I do.\" In 1948, historian Eric Goldman noted that the definition of public relations in Webster's would be \"disputed by both practitioners and critics in the field.\"According to Bernays, the public relations counsel is the agent working with both modern media of communications and group formations of society in order to provide ideas to the public's consciousness. Furthermore, he is also concerned with ideologies and courses of actions as well as material goods and services and public utilities and industrial associations and large trade groups for which it secures popular support.\nIn August 1978, the World Assembly of Public Relations Associations defined the field as \"the art and social science of analyzing trends, predicting their consequences, counselling organizational leaders and implementing planned programs of action, which will serve both the organization and the public interest.\"\nPublic Relations Society of America, a professional trade association, defined public relations in 1982 as: \"Public relations helps an organization and its publics adapt mutually to each other.\"\nIn 2011 and 2012, the PRSA solicited crowd supplied definitions for the term and allowed the public to vote on one of three finalists. The winning definition stated that: \n\n\"Public relations is a strategic communication process that builds mutually beneficial relationships between organizations and their publics.\"\nPublic relations can also be defined as the practice of managing communication between an organization and its publics.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nPublic relations is not a phenomenon of the 20th century, but rather has historical roots. Most textbooks consider the establishment of the Publicity Bureau in 1900 to be the founding of the public relations profession. Academics have found early forms of public influence and communications management in ancient civilizations. such as Aristotle\u2019s rhetoric which explains the core foundations of persuasion. It is believed that there is an evolutionary aspect to PR and that it only has improved over time. Evidence shows that it continued to evolve during the settling of the New World and during the movement to abolish slavery in England. Basil Clark is considered the founder of public relations in the United Kingdom for his establishment of Editorial Services in 1924.The concept of propaganda, which later evolved into Public Relations was used by the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and others to rally for domestic support and demonize enemies during the World Wars. World War I was the first war which affected not only military but whole populations and is considered to be \"modern propaganda's launching pad.\" This led to more sophisticated commercial publicity efforts as public relations talent entered the private sector. Most historians believe modern-day public relations was first established in the US by Ivy Lee or Edward Bernays, then spread internationally. Many American companies with PR departments spread the practice to Europe when they created European subsidiaries as a result of the Marshall plan.In the second half of the 1900s, public relations entered an era of professional development. Trade associations, PR news magazines, international PR agencies, and academic principles for the profession were established. In the early 2000s, press release services began offering social media press releases. The Cluetrain Manifesto, which predicted the effect of social media in 1999, was controversial in its time, but by 2006, the effect of social media and new internet technologies became broadly accepted.\n\n\n== Career prospects ==\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nCosmopolitan reported that the average annual salary for a \"public relations director\" was \u00a377,619 in 2017. One notable former PR practitioner was former Prime Minister David Cameron.\n\n\n=== United States ===\n\n\n==== Education ====\nPublic relations practitioners typically have a bachelor's degree in journalism, communications, public relations, marketing, or English. Many senior practitioners have advanced degrees; a 2015 survey found that forty-percent of chief communications officers at Fortune 500 companies had master's degrees.In 2013, a survey of the 21,000 members of the Public Relations Society of America found that 18-percent held the Accreditation in Public Relations.\n\n\n==== Salary ====\nIn 2019, a PR Week survey found a median annual compensation of $95,000 for public relations practitioners, with sector medians ranging from $85,000 in the non-profit sector, $96,000 in a private agency setting, and $126,000 in a for-profit corporation. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, meanwhile, reports the median annual for \"public relations specialists\" at $68,000 in 2017 and $114,000 for \"public relations managers\".According to a study made by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2020, they found that public relations practitioners in the United States private sector \u2013 working at PR agencies \u2013 have a median salary of $57,940. Individuals that work within the federal sector have reported to be making a median income of $65,310. The information collected shows those that work for professional, labour, political, and similar organizations average $66,340 a year.\nThe c-level position of chief communications officer (CCO), used in some private companies, usually earned more than $220,000 annually as of 2013. CCOs at Fortune 200 companies, meanwhile, had an average compensation package of just over $1 million annually, according to a 2009 survey by Fortune; this amount included base salary, bonus, and stock options.Within the U.S. federal government, public affairs workers had a 2016 average salary of approximately $101,922, with the U.S. Forest Service employing the most such professionals. Of federal government agencies employing more than one public affairs worker, those at the Federal Aviation Administration earned the most, on average, at approximately $150,130. The highest-earning public affairs worker within the U.S. government, meanwhile, earned $229,333.Salaries of public relations specialists in local government vary widely. The chief communications officer of the Utah Transit Authority earned $258,165 in total compensation in 2014 while an early-career public information officer for the city of Conway, South Carolina had a pay range beginning at approximately $59,000 per year in 2017.\n\n\n=== Canada ===\nIndeed reported that the average annual salary for a \"public relations manager\" was $59,326 in June 2019. According to Stats Canada, there has been no growth in the demand for journalists in Canada, but the demand for PR practitioners continues to grow. Most journalists transition into public relations smoothly and bring a much-needed skill-set to the profession.\nPublic relations practitioners typically have a bachelor's degree in communications, public relations, journalism, or English. Some senior practitioners have advanced degrees. The industry has seen an influx of journalists because newsrooms are in decline and the salaries tend to be higher.\n\n\n== Tactics ==\nPublic relations professionals present the face of an organization or individual, usually to articulate its objectives and official views on issues of relevance, primarily to the media. Public relations contributes to the way an organization is perceived by influencing the media and maintaining relationships with stakeholders. According to Dr. Jacquie L\u2019Etang from Queen Margaret University, public relations professionals can be viewed as \"discourse workers specializing in communication and the presentation of argument and employing rhetorical strategies to achieve managerial aims.\"Specific public relations disciplines include:\n\nFinancial public relations \u2013 communicating financial results and business strategy\nConsumer/lifestyle public relations \u2013 gaining publicity for a particular product or service\nCrisis communication \u2013 responding in a crisis\nInternal communications \u2013 communicating within the company itself\nGovernment relations \u2013 engaging government departments to influence public policy\nMedia relations \u2013 a public relations function that involves building and maintaining close relationships with the news media so that they can sell and promote a business.\nSocial Media/Community Marketing - in today's climate, public relations professionals leverage social media marketing to distribute messages about their clients to desired target markets\nIn-house public relations \u2013 a public relations professional hired to manage press and publicity campaigns for the company that hired them.\n'Black Hat PR' - manipulating public profiles under the guise of neutral commentators or voices, or engaging to actively damage or undermine the reputations of the rival or targeted individuals or organizations.Building and managing relationships with those who influence an organization or individual's audiences have a central role in doing public relations. After a public relations practitioner has been working in the field, they accumulate a list of relationships that become an asset, especially for those in media relations.\nWithin each discipline, typical activities include publicity events, speaking opportunities, press releases, newsletters, blogs, social media, press kits, and outbound communication to members of the press. Video and audio news releases (VNRs and ANRs) are often produced and distributed to TV outlets in hopes they will be used as regular program content.\n\n\n=== Audience targeting ===\nA fundamental technique used in public relations is to identify the target audience and to tailor messages that are relevant to each audience. Sometimes the interests of differing audiences and stakeholders common to a public relations effort necessitate the creation of several distinct but complementary messages. These messages however should be relevant to each other, thus creating a consistency to the overall message and theme. Audience targeting tactics are important for public relations practitioners because they face all kinds of problems: low visibility, lack of public understanding, opposition from critics, and insufficient support from funding sources.On the other hand, stakeholder theory identifies people who have a stake in a given institution or issue. All audiences are stakeholders (or presumptive stakeholders), but not all stakeholders are members of a target audience. For example, if a charity commissions a public relations agency to create an advertising campaign to raise money to find a cure for a disease, the charity and the people with the disease are stakeholders, but the audience is anyone who is likely to donate money. Public relations experts possess deep skills in media relations, market positioning, and branding. They are powerful agents that help clients deliver clear, unambiguous information to a target audience that matters to them.\n\n\n=== The public in public relations ===\nA public is any group whose members have a common interest or common values in a particular subject, such as a political party. Those members would then be considered stakeholders, which are people who have a stake or an interest in an organization or issue that potentially involves the organization or group they're interested in. The Publics in Public Relations are:\n\nTraditional Publics: Groups with which the individual has an ongoing and long-term relationship with, this may include; Employees, Media, Governments, Investors, and Customers\nNon-Traditional Publics: Groups that are typically unfamiliar with the organization and the individual has not had a relationship with but may become traditional publics due to changes in the organization, in society or if a group changing event occurs.\nLatent Publics: A group whose values have come into contact with the values of the organization but whose members haven't yet realized it; the members of that public are not yet aware of the relationship.\nAware Publics: A group of members who are aware of the existence of a commonality of values or interests with your organization, but have not organized or attempted to respond to that commonality.\nIntervening Publics: Any public that helps an individual send a message to another public, could be the media or someone with stature.\nPrimary Publics: If a public can directly affect an organization's pursuit of its values-driven goals. This publics would include media, employees, government, shareholder, financial institutions, and the immediate community.\nSecondary Publics: Have high interest in the company such as the primary publics but will not be directly affected by decisions of the organization.\nInternal Publics: People within an organization\nExternal Publics: People outside of an organization\nDomestic Publics: Those within the country\nInternational Publics: Those outsides of the country and when communicating with this publics individuals must be wary of that areas culture, beliefs, values, ethic, and other valuable cultural difference as to not offend anyone.Early literature authored by James Grunig (1978) suggested that publics develop in stages determined by their levels of problem recognition, constraint recognition and involvement in addressing the issue. The theory posited that publics develop in the following stages:\n\nNon-Publics: Share no issue with an organization.\nLatent Publics: Face an issue but do not recognize it.\nApathetic Publics: Face an issue but do not care to address it.\nAware Publics: Face an issue but are unorganized to mobilize against it.\nActive Publics: Face an issue and are organized to respond to it. \n\n\n=== Messaging ===\nMessaging is the process of creating a consistent story around: a product, person, company, or service. Messaging aims to avoid having readers receive contradictory or confusing information that will instill doubt in their purchasing choices, or other decisions that affect the company. Brands aim to have the same problem statement, industry viewpoint, or brand perception shared across sources and media.\n\n\n=== Social media marketing ===\n\nDigital marketing is the use of Internet tools and technologies such as search engines, Web 2.0 social bookmarking, new media relations, blogging, and social media marketing. Interactive PR allows companies and organizations to disseminate information without relying solely on mainstream publications and communicate directly with the public, customers and prospects.\nPR practitioners have always relied on the media such as TV, radio, and magazines, to promote their ideas and messages tailored specifically to a target audience. Social media marketing is not only a new way to achieve that goal, it is also a continuation of a strategy that existed for decades. Lister et al. said that \"Digital media can be seen as a continuation and extension of a principal or technique that was already in place\".Social media platforms enable users to connect with audiences to build brands, increase sales, and drive website traffic. This involves publishing content on social media profiles, engaging with followers, analyzing results, and running social media advertisements. The goal is to produce content that users will share with their social network to help a company increase brand exposure and broaden customer reach. Some of the major social media platforms are currently Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, YouTube, and Snapchat.As digital technology has evolved, the methods to measure effective online public relations effectiveness have improved. The Public Relations Society of America, which has been developing PR strategies since 1947, identified 5 steps to measure online public relations effectiveness. \n\nEngagement: Measure the number of people who engaged with an item (social shares, likes and comments).\nImpressions: Measure the number of people who may have viewed an item.\nItems: Measure any content (blog posts, articles, etc.) that originally appeared as digital media.\nMentions: Measure how many online items mention the brand, organization, or product.\nReach: Measure how far the PR campaign managed to penetrate overall and in terms of a particular audience.\n\n\n=== Types of public relations arenas ===\nPublicists can work in a host of different types of business verticals such as entertainment, technology, music, travel, television, food, consumer electronics and more. Many publicists build their career in a specific business space to leverage relationships and contacts. There are different kinds of press strategies for such as B2B (business to business) or B2C (business to consumer). Business to business publicity highlights service providers who provide services and products to other businesses. Business to Consumer publicizes products and services for regular consumers, such as toys, travel, food, entertainment, personal electronics and music.\n\n\n=== Other techniques ===\nLitigation public relations is the management of the communication process during the course of any legal dispute or adjudicatory processing so as to affect the outcome or its effect on the client's overall reputation (Haggerty, 2003).\n\n\n== Ethics ==\nPublic relations professionals both serve the public's interest and private interests of businesses, associations, non-profit organizations, and governments. This dual obligation gave rise to heated debates among scholars of the discipline and practitioners over its fundamental values. This conflict represents the main ethical predicament of public relations. In 2000, the Public Relations Society of America (PRSA) responded to the controversy by acknowledging in its new code of ethics \"advocacy\" \u2013 for the first time \u2013 as a core value of the discipline.The field of public relations is generally highly un-regulated, but many professionals voluntarily adhere to the code of conduct of one or more professional bodies to avoid exposure for ethical violations. The Chartered Institute of Public Relations, the Public Relations Society of America, and The Institute of Public Relations are a few organizations that publish an ethical code. Still, Edelman's 2003 semi-annual trust survey found that only 20 percent of survey respondents from the public believed paid communicators within a company were credible. Individuals in public relations are growing increasingly concerned with their company's marketing practices, questioning whether they agree with the company's social responsibility. They seek more influence over marketing and more of a counseling and policy-making role. On the other hand, individuals in marketing are increasingly interested in incorporating publicity as a tool within the realm marketing.According to Scott Cutlip, the social justification for public relations is the right for an organization to have a fair hearing of their point of view in the public forum, but to obtain such a hearing for their ideas requires a skilled advocate.Marketing and communications strategist, Ira Gostin, believes there is a code of conduct when conducting business and using public relations. Public relations specialists have the ability to influence society. Fact-checking and presenting accurate information is necessary to maintain credibility with employers and clients.\n\n\n=== Public Relation Code of Ethics ===\nThe Public Relation Student Society of America has established a set of fundamental guidelines that people within the public relations professions should practice and use in their business atmosphere. These values are:\n\nAdvocacy: Serving the public interest by acting as responsible advocates for the clientele. This can occur by displaying the marketplace of ideas, facts and viewpoints to aid informed public debate.\nHonesty: Standing by the truth and accuracy of all facts in the case and advancing those statements to the public.\nExpertise: To become and stay informed of the specialized knowledge needed in the field of Public Relations. Taking that knowledge and improving the field through development, research and education. Meanwhile, professionals also build their understanding, credibility, and relationships to understand various audiences and industries.\nIndependence: Provide unbiased work to those that are represented while being accountable for all actions.\nLoyalty: Stay devoted to the client while remembering that there is a duty to still serve the public interest.\nFairness: Honorably conduct business with any and all clients, employers, competitors, peers, vendors, media and general public. Respecting all opinions and right of free expression.\n\n\n=== Spin ===\n\nSpin has been interpreted historically to mean overt deceit that is meant to manipulate the public, but since the 1990s has shifted to describing a \"polishing of the truth.\" Today, spin refers to providing a certain interpretation of information meant to sway public opinion. Companies may use spin to create the appearance of the company or other events are going in a slightly different direction than they actually are. Within the field of public relations, spin is seen as a derogatory term, interpreted by professionals as meaning blatant deceit and manipulation. Skilled practitioners of spin are sometimes called \"spin doctors.\"\nIn Stuart Ewen's PR! A Social History of Spin, he argues that public relations can be a real menace to democracy as it renders the public discourse powerless. Corporations are able to hire public relations professionals and transmit their messages through the media channels and exercise a huge amount of influence upon the individual who is defenseless against such a powerful force. He claims that public relations is a weapon for capitalist deception and the best way to resist is to become media literate and use critical thinking when interpreting the various mediated messages.According to Jim Hoggan, \" public relations is not by definition 'spin'. Public relations is the art of building good relationships. You do that most effectively by earning trust and goodwill among those who are important to you and your business... Spin us to public relations what manipulation is to interpersonal communications. It's a diversion whose primary effect is ultimately to undermine the central goal of building trust and nurturing a good relationship.\"The techniques of spin include selectively presenting facts and quotes that support ideal positions (cherry picking), the so-called \"non-denial denial,\" phrasing that in a way presumes unproven truths, euphemisms for drawing attention away from items considered distasteful, and ambiguity in public statements. Another spin technique involves careful choice of timing in the release of certain news so it can take advantage of prominent events in the news.\n\n\n=== Negative ===\n\nNegative public relations, also called dark public relations (DPR), 'black hat PR' and in some earlier writing \"Black PR\", is a process of destroying the target's reputation and/or corporate identity. The objective in DPR is to discredit someone else, who may pose a threat to the client's business or be a political rival. DPR may rely on IT security, industrial espionage, social engineering and competitive intelligence. Common techniques include using dirty secrets from the target, producing misleading facts to fool a competitor. In politics, a decision to use negative PR is also known as negative campaigning.\n\n\n=== T.A.R.E.S. ===\nThe T.A.R.E.S. is a five-point test that evaluates ethical persuasion and provides boundaries in persuasive practices.\n\nTruthfulness (of the message) examples\nIs this communicating something factually true and accurate?\nDoes this downplay or diminish evidence?\nAm I creating a false narrative or image?\nDoes this influence people to believe something that I do not believe myself?\nAuthenticity (of the persuader) examples\nWill people question my honesty or integrity from this?\nDo I truly believe that what is being presented will benefit those who are reading?\nDo I support or advocate in the statement, person, or product?\nRespect (for the persuadee) examples\nAm I presenting statements in self-interest, or do I genuinely care about the issue, person, or product?\nIs this presented to persuadees who are rational, self-thinking beings?\nWhat ethical responsibility do I hold by presenting this information?\nEquity (of the persuasive appeal) examples\nIs this appeal fair and nondiscriminatory?\nHave I target persuadees who are not capable of understanding the claims and the context?\nAre the statements I present sensitive to various interests, needs, or concerns of the persuadees?\nSocial Responsibility (for the common good) examples\nHave I unfairly stereotyped groups of society in my statements or actions?\nWill my statements or actions cause harms to various groups of society?\nWill there be any negative consequences against a group in society based on my statements or actions?\nHave I fairly presented issues that concern groups who may have been underrepresented in society?\nAre the statements or actions that are being communicated responsible to various societal groups, public interest, and the public?\n\n\n=== Politics and civil society ===\nIn Propaganda (1928), Bernays argued that the manipulation of public opinion was a necessary part of democracy. In public relations, lobby groups are created to influence government policy, corporate policy or public opinion, typically in a way that benefits the sponsoring organization.\nIn fact, Bernays stresses that we are in fact dominated in almost every aspect of our lives, by a relatively small number of persons who have mastered the 'mental processes and social patterns of the masses,\u2019 which include our behavior, political and economic spheres or our morals. In theory, each individual chooses his own opinion on behavior and public issues. However, in practice, it is impossible for one to study all variables and approaches of a particular question and come to a conclusion without any external influence. This is the reason why the society has agreed upon an 'invisible government' to interpret on our behalf information and narrow the choice field to a more practical scale.When a lobby group hides its true purpose and support base, it is known as a front group. Front groups are a form of astroturfing, because they intend to sway the public or the government without disclosing their financial connection to corporate or political interests. They create a fake grass-roots movement by giving the appearance of a trusted organization that serves the public, when they actually serve their sponsors.\nPoliticians also employ public relations professionals to help project their views, policies and even personalities to their best advantages.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nA History of Public Relations (PDF), The Institute for Public Relations, archived from the original (PDF) on 2 June 2010\nBreakenridge, Deirdre (2012), Social media and public relations: Eight new practices for the pr professional, New jersey: FT Press\nCutlip, Scott (1994), The Unseen Power: Public Relations: A History, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, ISBN 0-8058-1464-7\nCutlip, Scott (1995), Public Relations History: from the 17th to the 20th Century, Lawrence Earlbaum Associates, ISBN 0-8058-1780-8\nHeitmueller, Lars M.

Public relations (PR) and publicity differ in that PR is controlled internally, whereas publicity is not controlled and contributed by external parties. Public relations may include an organization or individual gaining exposure to their audiences using topics of public interest and news items that do not require direct payment. This differentiates it from advertising as a form of marketing communications. Public relations aims to create or obtain coverage for clients for free, also known as earned media, rather than paying for marketing or advertising.

When pressed during the interview with Chuck Todd to explain why Spicer would \"utter a provable falsehood\", Conway stated that Spicer was giving \"alternative facts\". Todd responded, \"Look, alternative facts are not facts. They're falsehoods.\"Conway's use of the phrase \"alternative facts\" for demonstrable falsehoods was widely mocked on social media and sharply criticized by journalists and media organizations, including Dan Rather, Jill Abramson, and the Public Relations Society of America. The phrase was extensively described as Orwellian, particularly in reference to the term doublethink. Within four days of the interview, sales of George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four had increased 95-fold, which The New York Times and others attributed to Conway's use of the phrase, making it the number-one bestseller on Amazon.com.Conway later defended her choice of words, defining \"alternative facts\" as \"additional facts and alternative information\".\n\n\n== Background ==\nOn January 21, 2017, while White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer held his first press briefing, he accused the media of deliberately underestimating the size of the crowd for President Trump's inaugural ceremony and stated that the ceremony had drawn the \"largest audience to ever witness an inauguration \u2013 period \u2013 both in person and around the globe\". According to rapid transit ridership data and photographic evidence Spicer's claims and allegations were false. Aerial images showed that the turnout for Trump's inauguration was lower than the turnout for the 2009 inauguration of Barack Obama. Spicer claimed that 420,000 people rode the DC Metro on inauguration day 2017, compared to 317,000 in 2013. He did not offer a source for his claim, or clarify the time periods being compared. Actual ridership figures between midnight and 11 AM were 193,000 in 2017, 317,000 in 2013. Full-day ridership was 570,557 in 2017, 782,000 in 2013.\nSpicer also gave incorrect information about the use of white ground coverings during the inauguration. He stated that they were used for the first time during the Trump inauguration and were to blame for a visual effect that made the audience look smaller. The white ground coverings, however, had been used in 2013 when Obama was sworn in for the second term. Spicer did not take questions from the media at the press briefing.\n\nTrump's campaign strategist and counselor, Kellyanne Conway, defended Spicer's statements in a Meet the Press interview. In response to a question from Todd about Trump's false claims regarding the inauguration crowd and the loss of credibility, Conway said:\"Our press secretary, Sean Spicer, gave alternative facts to that, but the point remains that...\"\nTodd interrupted her by saying \"Wait a minute. Alternative facts? ... Alternative facts are not facts. They're falsehoods.\" In her answer Conway argued that crowd numbers in general could not be assessed with certainty and objected to what she described as Todd's trying to make her look ridiculous.Conway later defended her choice of words, defining \"alternative facts\" as \"additional facts and alternative information\".Two days later, Spicer corrected his statements concerning the WMATA ridership levels, stating that he had been relying on statistics \"given to him\". He stood by his widely disputed claim that the inauguration was the most-viewed, stating he also included online viewership in addition to in-person and television in his figures.During the week following Conway's comments, she discussed \"alternative facts\", substituting the phrases \"alternative information\" and \"incomplete information\". Two days after the Todd interview she defended Trump's travel restrictions by talking about a nonexistent \"Bowling Green massacre\" (she later said she was referring to the arrest of two Iraqis in Bowling Green, Kentucky, for sending aid to insurgents in Iraq), and by falsely claiming that President Obama in 2011 had \"banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months\". Her false statements were described as having \"taken 'alternative facts' to a new level\".The phrase \"alternative facts\" was claimed to be similar to a phrase used in Trump's 1987 book, Trump: The Art of the Deal. In that book, \"truthful hyperbole\" was described as \"an innocent form of exaggeration\u2014and ... a very effective form of promotion\". The book claimed that \"people want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular.\" The ghostwriter of the book, Tony Schwartz, said he coined that phrase and claimed that Trump \"loved it\".Conway later defended her remarks in an interview published in March 2017: \"Two plus two is four. Three plus one is four. Partly cloudy, partly sunny. Glass half full, glass half empty. Those are alternative facts.\" In a radio interview with Mark Simone that was described by Salon in February 2018, she claimed that professional fact-checkers tend to be political liberals and are \"selecting what [they] think should be fact-checked...Americans are their own fact checkers. People know, they have their own facts and figures, in terms of meaning which facts and figures are important to them.\"\n\n\n== Reactions ==\n\n\n=== Criticism ===\nSpicer's press conference and Conway's follow-up comments drew quick reactions on social media. Journalist Dan Rather posted a criticism of the incoming Trump administration on his Facebook page. Rather wrote:\nThese are not normal times. These are extraordinary times. And extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. When you have a spokesperson for the president of the United States wrap up a lie in the Orwellian phrase \"alternative facts\".... When you have a press secretary in his first appearance before the White House reporters threaten, bully, lie, and then walk out of the briefing room without the cojones to answer a single question... Facts and the truth are not partisan. They are the bedrock of our democracy. And you are either with them, with us, with our Constitution, our history, and the future of our nation, or you are against it. Everyone must answer that question.\n\nThe New York Times responded with a fact check of statements made during Spicer's press conference. This included a side-by-side photographic comparison of the crowds from Obama's 2009 inauguration and that of Trump.\nJournalist and former New York Times executive editor Jill Abramson characterized Conway's comments about alternative facts as \"Orwellian newspeak\", and said \"'Alternative facts' are just lies\". NBC News quoted two experts on the psychology of lying who said that the Trump administration was engaging in gaslighting, and reported that the domain name alternativefacts.com had been purchased and redirected to an article on the subject.The Merriam-Webster dictionary website reported that lookups for the word \"fact\" spiked after Conway used the phrase \"alternative facts\". They also got involved by tweeting about it: \"A fact is a piece of information presented as having objective reality.\" The tweet included a link to their article about Conway's use of the term.Following Conway's Meet the Press interview and the viral response on social media in which \"alternative facts\" was likened to Doublethink and Newspeak, terms from George Orwell's dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, sales of the book increased by more than 9,500 percent, rising to the number one best-selling book on Amazon.com. The New York Times and others attributed this to Conway's statement. Penguin, the book's publisher, ordered a 75,000 unit reprint to meet demand.Snopes's journalist Alex Kasprak noted Carl Sagan's words in Sagan's book The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark became a viral meme about alternative facts after the inauguration of Trump, Kasprak commented \"the proffered description of that nightmare was authentic\".On January 24, 2017, the Public Relations Society of America, a public relations trade group, put out a statement that said \"Encouraging and perpetuating the use of alternative facts by a high-profile spokesperson reflects poorly on all communications professionals.\"\n\n\n=== Legal usage ===\nIn a Breitbart News article dated January 23, 2017, editor Joel Pollak defended Conway's use of \"alternative facts\" by arguing that it was a \"harmless, and accurate term in a legal setting, where each side of a dispute will lay out its own version of the facts for the court to decide.\" However, The Guardian noted that \"[a] search of several online legal dictionaries did not yield any results for the term.\"A week later, the conservative daily magazine American Thinker published an article asserting that \"it seems eminently possible that Ms. Conway knew exactly what it was she was saying\". After providing a single example of a legal use of the phrase \"alternative facts\", the author conceded that its citation demanded \"plausible evidence to support both alternatives\" and did not attempt to provide such evidence.On February 23, 2017, fifteen professors of law, some of whom are themselves obliged to adhere to the District of Columbia Bar Association's Rule of Professional Conduct, rule 8.4(a), filed a disciplinary complaint with the D.C. Bar's Office of Disciplinary Conduct. Their complaint applies against Conway, a lawyer in public office, on the grounds that under rule 8.4(c): \"It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation\", because of Conway's pattern of misrepresentation as well as her misuse of words such as \"massacre\" at a time when she holds high public office. The letter of complaint makes a specific reference to the use of the phrase \"alternative facts\" as being involved in one of the cases of alleged misconduct, citing as a reference for its claim an opinion article by a New York Times Op-Ed columnist.\n\n\n=== In popular culture ===\nThe term alternative facts became a mainstay in popular culture, from late night comedians to serious news outlets. Jimmy Fallon created a segment \"Two Truths and an Alternative Fact\" on The Tonight Show. Stephen Colbert criticized Conway for saying she was not Inspector Gadget or \"in the job of having evidence\" on The Late Show, claiming \"Kellyanne Conway has only one move: 'Go, go, alternative facts!'\"CNN's ad campaign \"Facts First\" was a direct response to the concept of alternative facts and fake news. USA Today listed it in their \"Glossary of Trump terms.\"Both Robert De Niro and Steven Spielberg referred to alternative facts in their speech at the National Board of Review awards for the Spielberg film The Post. \"We are in a fight and it's a fight not just about alternative facts but it's a fight for the objective truth\" said Spielberg after accepting the award.The 2017 short film Alternative Math is a satire about the absurdity of the concept of alternative facts.On January 16, 2018, German linguists declared the phrase \"alternative facts\" the non-word of the year 2017. It was also chosen by Austrian linguists as the non-word of the year in December 2017.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nd'Ancona, Matthew (2017), Post-Truth: The New War on Truth and How to Fight Back, ISBN 978-1785036873\nGoodspeed, William (2017), Alternative Facts: Fake News, Tweets & the 2016 Election Paperback, Satirical Press International, ISBN 978-0998885308\nNoterie, Abrams (2017), Alternative Facts Journal, Harry N.

"content": "Circular reporting, or false confirmation, is a situation in source criticism where a piece of information appears to come from multiple independent sources, but in reality comes from only one source. In many cases, the problem happens mistakenly through sloppy intelligence-gathering practices. However, at other times the situation can be intentionally contrived by the original source as a way of reinforcing the widespread belief in its information.This problem occurs in a variety of fields, including intelligence gathering, journalism, and scholarly research. It is of particular concern in military intelligence because the original source has a higher likelihood of wanting to pass on misinformation, and because the chain of reporting is more prone to being obscured. It is also a problem in journalism and the development of conspiracy theories, in which the primary goal of a source spreading unlikely or hard-to-believe information is to make it appear to be widely known.\nThe case of the 2002 Niger uranium forgeries was a classic instance of circular reporting by intelligence agencies.\n\n\n== Circular reporting on Wikipedia ==\n\nWikipedia is sometimes criticized for being used as a source of circular reporting, particularly a variant where an unsourced claim in a Wikipedia article is repeated by a reliable source, citing the article; which is then added as a source to the initial claim.\n\n\n=== History of citogenesis ===\n\nIn November 2011, Randall Munroe coined the term citogenesis to describe this phenomenon in an xkcd comic strip, as wordplay on cytogenesis (the original process for the creation of cells) except for citations (often shortened to \"cites\"). The popularity of the comic brought the term into common use, and raised awareness about the risks of Wikipedia-mediated citogenesis for readers and journalists alike. \nThe four-step process illustrated by the comic has been referenced as the typical way that circular reporting develops via Wikipedia.  This has been described as particularly hard-to-catch because of the speed of revisions of modern webpages, and the lack of \"as of\" timestamps in citations and \"last updated\" timestamps on pages online.Inspired by the comic, Wikipedia editors have since maintained an internal list of citogenesis incidents, to monitor its prevalence.Wikipedia advises researchers and journalists to be wary of, and generally avoid, using Wikipedia as a direct source, and to focus instead on verifiable information found in an article's cited references. Researchers and Wikipedians alike are advised to note the retrieved-on date of any web citation, to support identification of the earliest source of a claim.\n\n\n=== Examples on Wikipedia ===\n\nProminent examples of false claims that were propagated on Wikipedia and in news sources because of circular reporting:\n\n2007: Wikipedia and The Independent propagated the false information that comedian Sacha Baron Cohen had worked at Goldman Sachs.\n2008: A student arbitrarily added \"also known as....Brazilian Aardvarks\" to the article on the coati, leading to subsequent commentary on the mammal that mentioned this nickname. Outlets repeating the nickname included The Independent, the Daily Express, the Metro, The Daily Telegraph, the Daily Mail, a book published by the University of Chicago, and a scholarly work published by the University of Cambridge.\n2009: The middle name \"Wilhelm\" was falsely added into Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg's name. This was propagated by a raft of publications, including German and international press.\n2009: An incorrect release year of 1991 was added to the Wikipedia article of the Casio F-91W watch. The BBC repeated this in a 2011 article. Communication with primary sources repeatedly confirmed a 1989 release year, but as a reliable secondary source, the BBC's use of 1991 made the misinformation difficult to remove. In 2019, KSNV cited this incident as another example of citogenesis.  The correct year was only restored after that review, with the KSNV article becoming cited in the article to support restoring the 1989 release date.\n2014: A statement was anonymously added to the Wikipedia page on UK comedian Dave Gorman stating that he had \"taken a career break for a sponsored hitch-hike around the Pacific Rim countries\". When this was questioned, an article published at a later date (September 2014) in The Northern Echo, a daily regional newspaper in North East England was cited as evidence. Gorman repudiated the claim in an episode of his UK television show Modern Life Is Goodish (first broadcast 22 November 2016).\n\n\n== Examples outside Wikipedia ==\nIn 2001, the Niger uranium forgeries, documents initially released by SISMI (the former military intelligence agency of Italy), seemed to depict an attempt made by Saddam Hussein in Iraq to purchase yellowcake uranium powder from Niger during the Iraq disarmament crisis. They were referenced by other intelligence agencies to convince their governments or publics that such a purchase had taken place.\nIn 2018, Shehroze Chaudhry was identified as an active member of the Islamic State who participated in the killing of several individuals, through reporting involving a The New York Times podcast, among others. The podcast and other outlets referenced blog posts authored by Chaudhry starting in 2016. The podcast was taken by government officials and others as evidence of the crime; however, the original posts were unverified and later renounced by the author.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCircular reasoning\nCircular reference\nDon't repeat yourself (DRY)\nGhost word\nHoax\nMedia echo chamber\nReliability of Wikipedia\nRumor\nSelf-reference\nSelf-reference effect\nSingle source of truth\nSingle version of the truth\nSystem of record\nWikiality\nWoozle effect\n\n\n== References ==", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Circular_reporting.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1b/Nuvola_apps_kaboodle.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Relationship_between_Wikipedia_and_the_press.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b6/Citogenesis.png"], "summary": "Circular reporting, or false confirmation, is a situation in source criticism where a piece of information appears to come from multiple independent sources, but in reality comes from only one source.
