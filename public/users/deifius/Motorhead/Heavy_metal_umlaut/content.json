"A metal umlaut is a diacritic that is sometimes used gratuitously or decoratively over letters in the names of hard rock or heavy metal bands\u2014for example, those of Blue \u00d6yster Cult, Queensr\u00ffche, Mot\u00f6rhead, the Acc\u00fcsed, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and the parody band Sp\u0131n\u0308al Tap.\n\n\n== Usage ==\nAmong English speakers, the use of umlaut marks and other diacritics with a blackletter typeface is a form of foreign branding which has been attributed to a desire for a \"gothic horror\" feel. The metal umlaut is not generally intended to affect the pronunciation of the band's name, unlike the umlaut in German (where the letters u and \u00fc represent distinct vowels) and the Scandinavian languages (where \u00e5, \u00e4 and a, \u00f6, \u00f8 and o are distinct letters).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first gratuitous use of the umlaut in the name of a hard rock or metal band appears to have been by Blue \u00d6yster Cult in 1970. Blue \u00d6yster Cult's website states it was added by guitarist and keyboardist Allen Lanier, but rock critic Richard Meltzer claims to have suggested it to their producer and manager Sandy Pearlman just after Pearlman came up with the name: \"I said, 'How about an umlaut over the O?' Metal had a Wagnerian aspect anyway.\"\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nSpeakers of languages which use an umlaut to designate a pronunciation change may understand the intended effect, but perceive the result differently. When M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce visited Germany, singer Vince Neil said the band couldn't figure out why \"the crowds were chanting, 'Mutley Cruh! Mutley Cruh!'\"These decorative umlauts have been parodied in film and fiction; in an interview about the mockumentary film This Is Sp\u0131n\u0308al Tap, fictional rocker David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean) says, \"It's like a pair of eyes. You're looking at the umlaut, and it's looking at you.\" The heavy metal parody band Gwar parodied the use of metal umlauts in a lyric insert included with its first record, stylizing the song names with gratuitous diacritics. In 1997, the satirical newspaper The Onion published an article titled \"\u00dcnited St\u00e4tes Toughens Image With Umlauts.\"\n\n\n== Band or album name examples ==\n\n\n=== English-speaking countries ===\nThe Acc\u00fcsed \u2013 American \u0441rossover thrash band.\nAss\u00fcck \u2013 American grindcore band.\nBarbari\u00f6n - Australian metal band.\nBeow\u00fclf \u2013 California thrash metal band.\nBlue \u00d6yster Cult \u2013 American hard rock band.\nThe Cr\u00fcxshadows \u2013 American alternative rock band.\nD\u00e4lek \u2013 American hip-hop band.\nDeath in June \u2013 British dark folk/experimental band used umlauts and accented \"e\"s in their name and titles on the original releases of their albums The W\u00f6rld Th\u00e4t S\u00fcmmer (1985) and Th\u00e9 W\u00e4ll \u00d6f S\u00e4crific\u00e9 (1989), spelling their name, De\u00e4th In J\u00fcne and D\u00e9\u00e4th In J\u00fcn\u00e9, respectively on each.\nDestr\u00f6yer 666 \u2013 Thrash metal/Black metal band.\nDethklok \u2013 fictional metal band from the cartoon Metalocalypse, sometimes spelled as \"D\u00ebthkl\u00f8k\" in the band's logo.\nGreen Jell\u00ff \u2013 comedy metal band, originally spelled (and still pronounced) Green Jell\u00f6.\nG\u0308r\u0308o\u1e97us\u0308 \u2013 Experimental band, their logo design has umlauts over only the consonants.\nH\u00fcsker D\u00fc \u2013 American punk band (the game \"H\u016bsker D\u016b?\" was published with macrons instead of umlauts).\nInfern\u00e4l M\u00e4jesty \u2013 Canadian thrash metal band.\nJack \u00dc \u2013 American EDM DJ duo, side group and collaborative project, consisting of Mad Decent founder Diplo and OWSLA founder Skrillex.\nK\u00efll Cheerlead\u00ebr \u2013 Canadian punk metal band.\nKing Creosote \u2013 Scottish band sometimes used a three-dot \"umlaut\" in some of their artwork, over the \"i\".\nL\u0227\u0227z Rockit \u2013 American thrash band (German pronunciation would be almost \"Let's rock it\").\nL\u00e4ther \u2013 album of Frank Zappa, used an umlaut in its title.\nLeft\u00f6ver Crack \u2013 American anarcho punk band.\nMax\u00efmo Park \u2013 British indie rock band.\nM\u00f6ng\u00f6l H\u00f6rde \u2013 British hardcore punk/noise rock band.\nM\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce \u2013 American glam metal band.\nMot\u00f6rhead \u2013 English rock band.\nMoxy Fr\u00fcvous \u2013 Canadian political satire band.\nNight on Br\u00f6cken \u2013 debut album by American progressive metal band Fates Warning.
