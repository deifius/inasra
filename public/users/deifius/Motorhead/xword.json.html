The band are often considered a precursor to the new wave of British heavy metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Though several guitarists and drummers have played in Mot\u00f6rhead, most of their best-selling albums and singles feature the work of Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor on drums and \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke on guitars.\nMot\u00f6rhead released 22 studio albums, 10 live recordings, 12 compilation albums, and five EPs over a career spanning 40 years. Usually a power trio, they had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums Overkill, Bomber, Ace of Spades, and particularly the live album No Sleep 'til Hammersmith cemented Mot\u00f6rhead's reputation as a top-tier rock band. The band are ranked number 26 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. As of 2016, they have sold more than 15 million albums worldwide.Most often classified as heavy metal, Mot\u00f6rhead has been credited with being part of and influencing numerous musical scenes, thrash metal and speed metal especially. Lemmy, however, always insisted that they were a rock and roll band. He said that they had more in common with punk bands, but with their own unique sound, Mot\u00f6rhead is embraced in both punk and metal scenes. Their lyrics typically covered such topics as war, good versus evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, substance abuse, and, most famously, gambling, the latter theme being the focus of their hit song \"Ace of Spades\".Lemmy died on 28 December 2015 from cardiac arrhythmia and congestive heart failure, after being diagnosed with prostate cancer. The day after his death, drummer Mikkey Dee and guitarist Phil Campbell both confirmed that Mot\u00f6rhead had disbanded. By 2018, all three members of Mot\u00f6rhead's classic lineup (Lemmy, Taylor and Clarke) had died.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Formation and early years, 1975\u20131977 ===\n\nLemmy was dismissed from Hawkwind in May 1975 after being arrested in Canada for drug possession; he said the band dismissed him for \"doing the wrong drugs\". Now on his own, Lemmy decided to form a new band called Mot\u00f6rhead, the name was inspired by the final song he had written for Hawkwind.Lemmy wanted the music to be \"fast and vicious, just like the MC5\". His stated aim was to \"concentrate on very basic music: loud, fast, city, raucous, arrogant, paranoid, speedfreak rock n roll ... it will be so loud that if we move in next door to you, your lawn will die\". He recruited guitarist Larry Wallis (formerly of Pink Fairies) on the recommendation of Mick Farren, based on Wallis' work with Steve Peregrin Took's band Shagrat, and Lucas Fox on drums. According to Lemmy, the band's first practice was at the now defunct Sound Management rehearsal studios, in Kings Road, Chelsea in 1975. Sound Management leased the basement area of furniture store The Furniture Cave, located in adjacent Lots Road. Kilmister has said they used to steal equipment, as the band was short on gear. Their first engagement was supporting Greenslade at The Roundhouse, London on 20 July 1975. On 19 October, having played 10 gigs, they became the supporting act to Blue \u00d6yster Cult at the Hammersmith Odeon.The band were contracted to United Artists by Andrew Lauder, the A&R man for Lemmy's previous band, Hawkwind. They recorded sessions at Rockfield Studios in Monmouth with producer Dave Edmunds, during which Fox proved to be unreliable and was replaced by drummer Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor, a casual acquaintance of Lemmy's. Their record label was dissatisfied with the material and refused to release it, although it was subsequently issued as On Parole in 1979 after the band had established some success.In March 1976, deciding that two guitarists were required, the band auditioned an acquaintance of drummer Taylor's named \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke.  Wallis, who was continuing to tour with a reformed Pink Fairies, quit immediately after the auditions and Clarke remained as the sole guitarist. This trio of Lemmy/Clarke/Taylor is today regarded as the \"classic\" Mot\u00f6rhead line-up. In December, the band recorded the \"Leaving Here\" single for Stiff Records, but United Artists intervened to prevent its general release as the band were still under contract to them, despite the label's refusal to issue their debut album. Initial reactions to the band had been unfavourable; they won a poll for \"the best worst band in the world\" in the music magazine NME.By April 1977, living in squats and with little recognition, Taylor and Clarke decided to quit the band, and after some debate, they agreed to do a farewell show at the Marquee Club in London. Lemmy had become acquainted with Ted Carroll from Chiswick Records and asked him to bring a mobile studio to the show to record it for posterity. Carroll was unable to get the mobile unit to the Marquee Club on 1 April 1977, but showed up backstage after the engagement and offered them two days at Escape Studios with producer Speedy Keen to record a single. The band took the chance, and instead of recording a single they laid down 11 unfinished tracks. Carroll gave them a few more days at Olympic Studios to finish the vocals and the band completed 13 tracks for release as an album. Chiswick issued the single \"Motorhead\" in June, followed by the album Mot\u00f6rhead in August, which spent one week in the UK Albums Chart at number 43. The band toured the UK supporting Hawkwind in June, then from late July they commenced the \"Beyond The Threshold Of Pain Tour\" with The Count Bishops.In August, Tony Secunda took over the management of the band, and their cohesiveness became so unstable that by March 1978, Clarke and Taylor had formed and were performing as The Muggers with Speedy Keen and Billy Rath.\n\n\n=== Rise to success: Overkill and Bomber, 1978\u20131979 ===\n\nIn July 1978, the band returned to the management of Douglas Smith, who secured a one-off singles deal with Bronze Records. The resulting \"Louie Louie\" single was issued in September peaking at number 68 on the UK Singles Chart, and the band toured the UK to promote it, recorded a BBC Radio 1 John Peel in session on 18 September (these tracks were later issued on the 2005 BBC Live & In-Session album), and appeared for the first time on BBC Television's Top of the Pops on 25 October. Chiswick capitalised on this new level of success by re-issuing the debut album Mot\u00f6rhead on white vinyl through EMI Records.\nThe single's success led to Bronze extending their contract, and put the band back into the studio to record an album, this time with producer Jimmy Miller at Roundhouse Studios. A hint of what the band had recorded for the album came on 9 March 1979 when the band played \"Overkill\" on Top of the Pops to support the release of the single ahead of the Overkill album, which was released on 24 March. It became Mot\u00f6rhead's first album to break into the top 40 of the UK Albums chart, reaching number 24, with the single reaching number 39 on the UK Singles Chart. These releases were followed by the \"Overkill\" UK tour which began on 23 March. A subsequent single was released in June, coupling the album track \"No Class\" as the A-side with the previously unreleased song \"Like a Nightmare\" on the B-side. It fared worse than both the album and previous single but reached number 61 on the UK singles chart.During July and August, except for a break to appear at the Reading Festival, the band were working on their next album, Bomber. Released on 27 October, it reached number 12 on the UK Albums Chart. On 1 December, it was followed by the \"Bomber\" single, which reached number 34 on the UK Singles Chart. The \"Bomber\" Europe and UK tour followed, with support from Saxon. The stage show featured a spectacular aircraft bomber-shaped lighting rig. During the \"Bomber\" tour, United Artists put together tapes recorded during the Rockfield Studios sessions in 1975\u20131976 and released them as the album On Parole, which peaked at number 65 on the UK Albums Chart in December.On 8 May 1980, while the band were on tour in Europe, Bronze released The Golden Years, which sold better than any of their previous releases, reaching number eight on the UK Singles Chart. The band had, however, preferred the title Flying Tonight, in reference to the \"Bomber\" lighting rig. On 20 August, the band had a 40-minute filmed slot, along with Girlschool's 20 minutes performing live at the Nottingham Theatre Royal for the Rockstage programme, broadcast on UK television by the ATV on 4 April 1981.\n\n\n=== Ace of Spades and Iron Fist, 1980\u20131982 ===\n\nDuring August and September 1980, the band were at Jackson's Studios in Rickmansworth, recording with producer Vic Maile. The \"Ace of Spades\" single was released on 27 October 1980 as a preview of the Ace of Spades album, which followed on 8 November. The single reached No. 15 and the album reached No. 4 on the UK charts. Bronze celebrated its gold record status by pressing a limited edition of the album in gold vinyl.\nMot\u00f6rhead made an appearance on Top of the Pops in November that year with \"Ace of Spades\", and between 22 October and 29 November the band were on their \"Ace Up Your Sleeve\" UK tour with support from Girlschool and Vardis, and also made an appearance as guests on the ITV children's show Tiswas on 8 November. The \"Arizona desert-style\" pictures used on the album sleeve and tour booklet cover were taken during a photo session at a sandpit in Barnet. \"Ace of Spades\", considered to be the definitive Mot\u00f6rhead anthem, \"put a choke on the English music charts and proved to all that a band could succeed without sacrificing its blunt power and speed\".\n\nTo coincide with the Ace of Spades release, Big Beat, who had inherited the Chiswick catalogue, put together four unused tracks from the Escape Studios sessions in 1977 and released them as Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers, which reached No. 43 on the UK Singles Chart in November.The band had more chart hits in 1981 with the releases St. Valentine's Day Massacre EP, their collaboration with Girlschool which reached No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart in February; the live version of \"Motorhead\", which reached No. 6 on the UK Singles Chart in July; and the album it was taken from, No Sleep 'til Hammersmith, which reached No. 1 on the UK Albums Chart in June. During March 1981, the band had been touring Europe, and in the final week of the month they conducted the \"Short Sharp, Pain in the Neck\" UK tour from which the recordings for No Sleep 'til Hammersmith were made.From April through to July, the band toured North America for the first time as guests of Blizzard of Ozz, an early incarnation of Ozzy Osbourne's band, but were still able to make an appearance on Top of the Pops on 9 July to promote the live \"Motorhead\" single. In October the band recorded tracks at BBC's Maida Vale studio for the David Jensen show broadcast on 6 October. The band commenced a European tour on 20 November, supported by Tank, after which Clarke produced Tank's debut album Filth Hounds of Hades at Ramport Studios in December and January.\nBetween 26 and 28 January 1982, the band started recording their self-produced new album at Ramport Studios, before moving onto Morgan Studios to continue the sessions throughout February. On 3 April the single \"Iron Fist\" was released, reaching No. 29 on the UK Singles Chart, followed by the parent album Iron Fist, released on 17 April and peaking at No. 6 on the UK Albums Chart. They were the last releases to feature the Lemmy, Clarke, Taylor line-up, though the line-up continued to perform in the Iron Fist UK tour between 17 March and 12 April, and the band's first headlining North America tour from 12 May until Clarke's last engagement at the New York Palladium on 14 May.\n\n\n=== Departures, Another Perfect Day and No Remorse, 1982\u20131985 ===\nClarke left as a consequence of the band recording Stand By Your Man, a cover version of the Tammy Wynette classic, in collaboration with Wendy O. Williams and the Plasmatics. Clarke felt that the song compromised the band's principles, refused to play on the recording and resigned, later forming his own band, Fastway. Lemmy and Taylor made numerous telephone calls to find a guitarist, including one to Brian Robertson, formerly with Thin Lizzy, who was recording a solo album in Canada. He agreed to help out and complete the tour with them. Robertson signed a one-album deal resulting in 1983's Another Perfect Day and the two singles from it, \"Shine\" and \"I Got Mine\".In June and July the band played five dates in Japan, and from mid-October until mid-November they toured Europe. From late May until early July, the band conducted the \"Another Perfect Tour\", followed by an American tour between July and August, and another European tour in October and November. Robertson began to cause friction in the band as a result of his on-stage attire, consisting of shorts and ballet shoes, and with his pointblank refusal to play the old standards that every Mot\u00f6rhead audience expected to hear. This led to an amicable agreement that Robertson would leave, playing his last engagement with the band at the Berlin Metropol on 11 November.After Robertson's departure in 1983, the band were sent tapes from all over the world from potential guitarists. The group returned to the concept of dual lead guitars by hiring unknowns W\u00fcrzel and Phil Campbell (formerly of Persian Risk). In February 1984, the Lemmy, Campbell, W\u00fcrzel, and Taylor line-up recorded \"Ace of Spades\" for the \"Bambi\" episode in the British television series, The Young Ones. Scenes of the band playing are interspersed with the characters' antics as they rush to the railway station, in a parody of The Beatles' comedy film A Hard Day's Night. Taylor quit the band after that recording, causing Lemmy to quip: \"Did I leave them or did they leave me?\". Before joining Mot\u00f6rhead, Phil Campbell had met former Saxon drummer Pete Gill, and the trio decided to call him to see if he would like to visit London. The try-outs went well and Gill was hired.Bronze Records thought the new line-up would not make the grade and decided to \"nail down the lid\" on the group with a compilation album. When Lemmy found out, he took over the project, selecting tracks, providing sleeve notes and insisted that Mot\u00f6rhead record four brand new tracks to go at the end of each side of the album. During the sessions between 19 and 25 May 1984 at Britannia Row Studios, London, the band recorded six tracks for the single's B-side and the album. The single \"Killed by Death\" was released on 1 September and reached No. 51 in the UK Singles Chart, the double album No Remorse was released on 15 September and reached silver disc status, attaining the position of No. 14 in the UK Album charts.The band were involved in a court case with Bronze over the next two years, believing that their releases were not being promoted properly, and the record company banned them from the recording studio. The band looked to more touring for income; Australia and New Zealand in late July to late August, a brief tour of Hungary in September, and the No Remorse \"Death on the Road\" tour between 24 October and 7 November. On 26 October the band made a live appearance on the British Channel 4 music programme The Tube, performing \"Killed By Death\", \"Steal Your Face\" (over which the programme's end-credits were played) and the unbroadcast \"Overkill\", before going on to their next engagement that evening. From 19 November to 15 December the band toured America with Canadian speed metal band Exciter and Danish heavy metal band Mercyful Fate and from 26 to 30 December performed five shows in Germany.On 5 April 1985, ITV broadcast four songs that were recorded after the band went off air on their earlier appearance on The Tube programme. A week later the band, dressed in tuxedos, played four songs on the live Channel 4 music show ECT (Extra-Celestial Transmission). To celebrate the band's 10th anniversary, two shows were arranged at Hammersmith Odeon on 28 and 29 June, a video of the second show was taken and later released as The Birthday Party. From early June until early August the band were on their 'It Never Gets Dark' tour of Sweden and Norway, an American tour followed in mid-November until late December.\n\n\n=== Orgasmatron and Rock 'n' Roll, 1986\u20131989 ===\nFrom 26 March to 3 April 1986, the band toured Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark on their \"Easter Metal Blast\" and in June, played two dates in Bologna and Milan in Italy. The court case with Bronze was finally settled in the band's favour. The band's management instigated their own label, GWR. Recording took place in Master Rock Studios, London and the single \"Deaf Forever\" was released on 5 July as a taster for the Orgasmatron album, which was released on 9 August. On the same day as the release of the album, Lemmy and W\u00fcrzel were interviewed by Andy Kershaw on the BBC Radio 1 Saturday Live show and \"Orgasmatron\" and \"Deaf Forever\" were played. The single reached No. 67 and the album reached No. 21 in the UK charts.On 16 August, the band played at the Monsters of Rock at Castle Donington and was recorded by BBC Radio 1 for a future Friday Rock Show broadcast. The performance closed with a flypast by a couple of Second World War German aircraft. Also that day Lemmy was filmed giving his views on spoof metal act \"Bad News\" for inclusion in a Peter Richardson Comic Strip film entitled \"More Bad News\" since the band featuring Rik Mayall, Peter Richardson, Nigel Planer and Adrian Edmondson were also performing at Donington. In September the band conducted their \"Orgasmatron\" tour in Great Britain, supported by fledgling act Zodiac Mindwarp and the Love Reaction. In October they toured America and in December were in Germany.In 1987, during the filming of Eat the Rich \u2013 in which Lemmy was taking a starring role alongside well-known comedy actors such as Robbie Coltrane, Kathy Burke, the regulars from The Comic Strip ensemble, and various other musician cameo appearances \u2013 Gill left the band and Taylor returned to appear in the band's cameo as \"In House Club Band\" alongside W\u00fcrzel and Campbell. The band wrote \"Eat the Rich\" especially for the film, its soundtrack featured tracks from Orgasmatron and W\u00fcrzel's solo single \"Bess\". The band's second album for GWR was Rock 'n' Roll, released on 5 September, after a tight work schedule in the studio. While having some popular tracks and using \"Eat the Rich\" as its second track, the band commented that the album was virtually \"nailed together\".On 2 July 1988 Mot\u00f6rhead were one of the performers at the Giants of Rock Festival in H\u00e4meenlinna, Finland. The tracks were released as No Sleep at All on 15 October. A single from the album was planned with the band wanting \"Traitor\" as the A-side, but \"Ace of Spades\" was chosen instead. When the band noticed the change, they refused to allow the single to be distributed to the shops, and it was withdrawn and became available only on the \"No Sleep at All\" tour and through the Mot\u00f6rheadbangers fan club. While they continued to play live shows during 1989 and 1990, Mot\u00f6rhead once again felt unhappy with their career, and a court case with GWR followed, which was not resolved until mid-1990.\n\n\n=== Epic/WTG years: 1916 and March \u00f6r Die, 1990\u20131992 ===\nWith the court case resolved, Mot\u00f6rhead signed to Epic/WTG and spent the last half of 1990 recording a new album and single in Los Angeles. Just prior to the album sessions the band's former manager, Doug Smith, released the recording of the band's 10th anniversary show, much against the bands wishes, having previously told him that they did not want it released, in 1986. In the studio they recorded four songs with producer Ed Stasium, before deciding he had to go.\nWhen Lemmy listened to one of the mixes of \"Going to Brazil\", he asked for him to turn up four tracks, and on doing so heard claves and tambourines that Stasium had added without their knowledge. Stasium was fired and Peter Solley was hired as producer. The story according to Stasium was that Lemmy's drug and alcohol intake had far exceeded the limitations of Stasium's patience so he quit. The single \"The One to Sing the Blues\" issued on 24 December 1990 (7\" and CD) and 5 January 1991 (12\"), was followed by the album 1916 on 21 January. The single, which was issued in 7\", cassette, shaped picture disc, 12\" and CD single, reached No. 45 in the UK Singles Chart, the album reached No. 24 in the UK Album Charts.The band conducted their \"It Serves You Right\" tour of Britain in February, the \"Lights Out Over Europe\" tour followed, lasting until early April, when the band returned to Britain to play another six venues. In June the band played five dates in Japan and five dates in Australia and New Zealand. Between July and August, they played across the United States with Judas Priest, Alice Cooper, Metal Church and opener Dangerous Toys on the \"Operation Rock 'n' Roll\" tour. The band finished the year with six dates in Germany during December.On 28 March 1992, the band played what would turn out to be Taylor's last engagement at Irvine Meadows, Irvine, California. The band had been wanting Lemmy to get rid of their manager, Doug Banker, for some time and after an unsolicited visit from Todd Singerman, who insisted he should manage them despite never having managed a band before, the band met with Singerman and decided to take him on board, firing Banker. In the midst of this, the band were recording an album at Music Grinder Studios, in the city's east part of Hollywood during the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Three drummers participated in the making of the March \u00f6r Die album: Phil Taylor, who was fired because he did not learn the drum tracks on the song \"I Ain't No Nice Guy\"; Tommy Aldridge who recorded most of the material on the album; and Mikkey Dee, who recorded \"Hellraiser\", a song originally written by Lemmy for Ozzy Osbourne's No More Tears album. March \u00f6r Die features guest appearances by Ozzy Osbourne and Slash.\n\n\n=== Bastards, Sacrifice and Overnight Sensation, 1993\u20131997 ===\nLemmy had known Mikkey Dee from the time when King Diamond had toured with Mot\u00f6rhead. He had asked Dee to become Mot\u00f6rhead's drummer before, but Dee had declined due to his commitment to King Diamond. On this occasion, Dee was available and met the band to try out. Playing the song \"Hellraiser\" first, Lemmy thought \"he was very good immediately. It was obvious that it was going to work.\" After recording \"Hellraiser\" and \"Hell on Earth\" in the studio, Dee's first engagement with Mot\u00f6rhead was on 30 August at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center. The new line-up then went on tour, playing dates with Ozzy Osbourne, Skew Siskin and Exodus. On 27 September, the band played at the Los Angeles Coliseum with Metallica and Guns N' Roses. The band toured Argentina and Brazil during October and conducted the \"Bombers and Eagles in '92\" tour of Europe with Saxon throughout December.Mot\u00f6rhead played two dates at the Arena Obras Sanitarias in Buenos Aires in April 1993 and toured Europe from early June until early July, returning to the United States to play one show at the New York Ritz on 14 August. A new producer was sought for the band's next album and eventually Howard Benson, who was to produce the band's next four albums, was chosen. The band recorded at A&M Studios and Prime Time Studios in Hollywood and the resultant album, titled Bastards, was released on 29 November 1993. The single \"Don't Let Daddy Kiss Me\" included the song \"Born to Raise Hell\", which also appeared on the album and would later be re-recorded with collaborative vocals from both Ice-T and Ugly Kid Joe frontman Whitfield Crane for the soundtrack of the movie Airheads (in which Lemmy also made a cameo appearance) and released as a single in its own right. Although Bastards received airtime, the record company ZYX Music would not pay for promotional copies, so the band sent out copies themselves. A further tour of Europe was made throughout December that year.In February and March 1994, Mot\u00f6rhead toured the United States with Black Sabbath and Morbid Angel. In April the band resumed their tour of the States until early May, playing an engagement with the Ramones on 14 May at the Estadio Velez in Buenos Aires, attracting a crowd of 50,000 people. The band toured Japan in late May and Europe in June, August and December.The band's 1995 touring schedule began in Europe in late April. In June, they went on a second tour with Black Sabbath, this time supported by Tiamat, until the band succumbed to influenza and headed back to Los Angeles and Cherokee Studios in Hollywood where they were to record an album. During the sessions it became clear that W\u00fcrzel was not extending himself and left the band after the recording. The title track from the album, Sacrifice, was later used in the movie Tromeo and Juliet, a film in which Lemmy appears as the narrator. The band decided to continue as a three-man line-up and a tour of Europe was performed throughout October and the first two days of November. A three-day tour of South America followed the week after. Lemmy celebrated his 50th Birthday later that year with the band at the Whisky a Go Go in Los Angeles; Metallica played at the event under the name \"The Lemmy's\".In 1996, the band began touring the States in early January and played 30 venues up to 15 February; a seven-date tour of Europe in June and July was followed by two engagements in South America during August. A tour of the United States with Belladonna and Speedball began with two shows (Los Angeles & Hollywood) in early October 1996 and concluded in Washington on 4 December. During this time the band had recorded Overnight Sensation, at Ocean Studio and Track House Recording Studio. The album was released on 15 October, the first official album of the band as a three-piece since Another Perfect Day and the best distributed album the band had had for years. The band concluded the year's touring with 13 dates in Germany.During 1997, the band toured extensively, beginning with the first leg of the Overnight Sensation tour in Europe on 12 January at the London Astoria, where the guest musicians were Todd Campbell, Phil Campbell's son, on \"Ace of Spades\" and \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke for \"Overkill\". The European leg lasted until March and was followed by four dates in Japan, from late May to 1 June, and an American tour with W.A.S.P. throughout the rest of June. In August, three dates in Europe were followed by seven dates in Britain, which ended with a show at the Brixton Academy on 25 October, where the guest musician was Paul Inder, Lemmy's son, for \"Ace of Spades\". A further four dates in October in Russia concluded the year 1997.\n\n\n=== Snake Bite Love, We Are Mot\u00f6rhead and Hammered, 1998\u20132003 ===\nLemmy recalled that the touring was going particularly well, with some countries like Argentina and Japan putting the band in larger venues, and the English promoters discovered that \"they could turn a nice profit with Mot\u00f6rhead shows\". In his opinion, the three-piece line-up was performing excellently and it was high time they made another live record. The band did eventually, but made another studio album first, Snake Bite Love, recorded in various studios and released on 3 March 1998.\nThe band joined with Judas Priest at the Los Angeles Universal Amphitheatre on 3 April, to begin their \"Snake Bite Love\" tour. On 21 May, Mot\u00f6rhead were recorded at The Docks in Hamburg. The tracks from this performance were later released as Everything Louder Than Everyone Else. The band were invited to join the Ozzfest Tour and played dates across the States during early July until early August and were in Europe from early October until late November. The British leg of the tour was dubbed the \"No Speak With Forked Tongue\" tour and included support bands Groop Dogdrill, Radiator and Psycho Squad, which was fronted by Phil Campbell's son Todd.In 1999 Mot\u00f6rhead made a tour of the states between 20 April and 2 June, before going to Karo Studios in Brackel, Germany to record their next album, We Are Mot\u00f6rhead, which was released in May the following year. During the time the album sessions took place, the band played at venues around Europe, the first of which was at Fila Forum in Assago, near Milan, where Metallica's James Hetfield joined the band on-stage to play \"Overkill\". In October and early November, the band toured the states with Nashville Pussy. Throughout the rest of November, the band conducted their European \"Monsters of the Millennium\" tour with Manowar, Dio and Lion's Share, ending the Millennium with two shows at the London Astoria. The two shows were billed under the Kerrang! \"X-Fest\" banner and at the first show were supported by Backyard Babies and during the second show guest vocals were provided by Skin from Skunk Anansie and Nina C. Alice from Skew Siskin for \"Born to Raise Hell\", and Ace from Skunk Anansie played \"Overkill\" with the band.\n\nIn May 2000, the release of We Are Mot\u00f6rhead and the single from it, a cover of the Sex Pistol's \"God Save the Queen\", coincided with the start of the band's \"We Are Mot\u00f6rhead\" tour across South and North America during May and June, with a further nine shows across in Europe in July. Shows in the United States and France were followed by the release of a double-disc compilation album, The Best Of, on 26 August.\nFour dates in Japan preceded the band's 25th anniversary concert on 22 October at the Brixton Academy in London, where guest appearances were made by \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke, Brian May, Doro Pesch, Whitfield Crane, Ace, Paul Inder and Todd Campbell. The show also featured the return of the Bomber lighting rig. The event was filmed and released the following year as the 25 & Alive Boneshaker DVD, and the CD of the show, Live at Brixton Academy, was released two years after that. Lemmy states the reason for the DVD as wanting \"to record it for the posterity or whatever it is. I nodded off through the 10th anniversary, we never did anything on the 20th, so the 25th made sense.\"A tour of West and East Europe followed the anniversary concert, taking the band through October, November and December. The schedule for the Eastern European tour was quite brutal, involving two 18-hour drives back-to-back and little time off, at the Warsaw venue the band did not arrive until 11 o'clock and the crew were still loading into the venue at one in the morning, while the fans waited.After taking a month off, the band began working on a new album at Chuck Reid's house in the Hollywood Hills. This album, Hammered, was released the following year. On 1 April 2001, the band gave a one-song performance for Triple H's entrance at WrestleMania X-Seven at the Reliant Astrodome in Houston. The second leg of the \"We Are Mot\u00f6rhead\" tour began in May in Ireland, moving across to the United Kingdom. In Manchester, the band were supported by Goldblade, and by Pure Rubbish at the two London shows. The second London show also included Backyard Babies and Paul Inder, who was guest musician for \"Killed By Death\". Between June and August, Mot\u00f6rhead played at a number of rock festivals in Europe; including as the Graspop Metal Meeting in Belgium, the Quart Festival in Norway, and the Wacken Open Air on 4 August, where four songs were recorded for the 25 & Alive Boneshaker DVD. The band returned to the States for a seven show tour between late September and early October.In April 2002, a DVD of some of Mot\u00f6rhead's performances from the 1970s and 1980s along with some stock footage of the band was released as The Best of Mot\u00f6rhead. Two weeks earlier, the Hammered album was released and supported by the \"Hammered\" tour, which kicked off in the States at around the same time. The United States dates continued until late May, and a European leg followed between June and August. In October, the band played five dates in Great Britain with Anthrax, Skew Siskin and Psycho Squad. The final venue was the Wembley Arena in London, where instead of Psycho Squad, the band were supported by Hawkwind, with Lemmy performing \"Silver Machine\" on stage with them. Throughout the rest of October and better part of November, the band were on a European tour with Anthrax.In April and May 2003, the band continued to promote the Hammered album in the States, and on the three dates Phil Campbell had to miss, his mother having died, Todd Youth stood in for him. Between late May and mid-July the band played seven dates at Summer Festivals in Europe and from late-July until the end of August, they were touring the United States with Iron Maiden and Dio. On 7 October a comprehensive five-disc collection of the band's recordings covering 1975\u20132002 was released as Stone Deaf Forever!. On 1 September 2003, the band returned to Hollywood's Whisky A Go-Go club for the Hollywood Rock Walk of Fame Induction.

They had already spent time in the studio, working on Inferno, which was released on 22 June and followed by the \"Inferno\" tour of Ireland with Class of Zero for three dates. Joined by Sepultura, the tour hit Great Britain. Some of the London show at the Hammersmith Apollo was filmed for TV as Gene Simmons introduced the extra opening act The Class, made up of school children from his Channel 4 series Rock School. W\u00fcrzel guested on \"Overkill\". The band continued the tour with Sepultura across Europe through the rest of November and December. At the show in Magdeburg, Germany on 4 December Mot\u00f6rhead joined Sepultura on stage during their support slot playing the song \"Orgasmatron\", in celebration of Sepultura's 20th Anniversary. The show on 7 December at the Philipshalle in D\u00fcsseldorf was recorded and later released as the Stage Fright DVD.\n\nMot\u00f6rhead picked up their first Grammy in the awards of 2005 in the Best Metal Performance category for their cover of Metallica's \"Whiplash\" on Metallic Attack: The Ultimate Tribute. \"They've managed to get the knife in,\" Lemmy grumbled. \"It was only a mercy fuck \u2013 it was our 30th anniversary. If they gave us a Grammy for one of our albums or songs, it would mean something.\"From March until early May 2005, the band toured the United States, and in June and August were on the \"30th Anniversary\" tour in Europe. On 22 August, they were the subject of an hour-long documentary, Live Fast, Die Old, aired on Channel 4 as part of The Other Side series of documentaries, filmed by new and established directors.On 20 September, a compilation containing the band's appearances on BBC Radio 1 and a concert recording from Paris Theatre, London, was released as BBC Live & In-Session.

Lemmy is old friends with Gary Weight, the team's manager; Weight \"sent an email off to them and they came back and said it was a great idea\" and hopes the deal will draw inspired performances from his team. On 25 April 2007, the band played at the Poliedro de Caracas in Caracas, Venezuela, and on 29 April at the Fundi\u00e7ao Progresso, Rio de Janeiro.

He's always on time. We go on stage, no delays. Being in bands where you have to wait around for a couple of hours fucks you up.\"In November 2009, the band were supported by NWOBHM veterans Sweet Savage on the Irish leg of the tour (30 years after first sharing the stage together) and punk and goth rock legends The Damned on the UK leg of their world tour. On The Damned's official website, Captain Sensible said: \"Ha ha ... we're working with Lemmy again, are we? Excellent! He's the real deal, the absolute antithesis to all that the likes of Simon Cowell stand for. And for that we should all be grateful. This tour will be a celebration of all things rock 'n' roll ... pity the poor roadies is all I can say!\"\n\n\n=== The W\u00f6rld Is Yours, Aftershock and Bad Magic, 2010\u20132015 ===\n\nIn a November 2009 interview with ABORT Magazine's E.S.

They played concerts in Germany, Sweden, Norway and Finland. Their final concert was in Berlin, Germany on 11 December 2015. After Lemmy's death, drummer Mikkey Dee spoke in an interview about him: \"He was terribly gaunt. He spent all his energy on stage and afterwards he was very, very tired. It's incredible that he could even play, that he could finish the Europe tour. It was only 20 days ago. Unbelievable.\" The \"40th Anniversary Tour\" was planned to continue in January 2016 in the band's home country the UK, the first concert would have been in Newcastle on 23 January 2016.\n\n\n=== Lemmy's death and breakup, Clean Your Clock and Under C\u00f6ver, 2015\u20132017 ===\nOn 28 December 2015, Lemmy died, four days after celebrating his 70th birthday. He was the second Mot\u00f6rhead member to die in 2015, following Phil Taylor the previous month. The band posted the following message on Facebook:\n\nThere is no easy way to say this... our mighty, noble friend Lemmy passed away today after a short battle with an extremely aggressive cancer. He had learnt of the disease on December 26th, and was at home, sitting in front of his favorite video game from The Rainbow which had recently made its way down the street, with his family.\nWe cannot begin to express our shock and sadness, there aren't words.\nWe will say more in the coming days, but for now, please... play Mot\u00f6rhead loud, play Hawkwind loud, play Lemmy's music LOUD.\nHave a drink or few.\nShare stories.\nCelebrate the LIFE this lovely, wonderful man celebrated so vibrantly himself.\nHE WOULD WANT EXACTLY THAT.\nIan 'Lemmy' Kilmister\n1945\u20132015\n\nBorn to lose, lived to win.\nThe following day, drummer Mikkey Dee confirmed that Mot\u00f6rhead would not continue, stating, \"Mot\u00f6rhead is over, of course. Lemmy was Mot\u00f6rhead. We won't be doing any more tours or anything. And there won't be any more records. But the brand survives, and Lemmy lives on in the hearts of everyone.\" Two days after Lemmy's death, guitarist Phil Campbell also stated that \"Mot\u00f6rhead is no longer\".A few days later, the band's long-time manager Todd Singerman told the press that Lemmy had experienced chest pains two days after his 70th birthday party (held at Whisky a Go Go) and visited into the emergency room, but was released the next day. However, Singerman was concerned because Lemmy's speech was \"getting bad\" and took him to a brain scan. On 26 December the doctor came into Lemmy's apartment, \"brought the results and told us all that he has two to six months to live\". Lemmy reacted calmly. \"He took it better than all of us\", said Singerman. \"His only comment was, 'Oh, only two months, huh?' The doctor goes, 'Yeah, Lem, I don't want to bullshit you. It's bad, and there's nothing anyone can do. I would be lying to you if I told you there was a chance.'\" Plans were made to treat Lemmy at home. A video game console at the Rainbow Bar and Grill that Lemmy loved to play was brought to his apartment. On 28 December 2015, he spent hours on the console, and Rainbow owner Mikael Maglieri paid a visit. Lemmy died in his sleep later that day.An autopsy on Kilmister showed that the causes of death were prostate cancer, a cardiac arrhythmia, and congestive heart failure.Initially planned on 27 May 2016, UDR Music released on 10 June 2016 Clean Your Clock, a Mot\u00f6rhead archive live album due to contain material recorded at the 20 and 21 November 2015 shows at the Zenith in Munich. On 1 September 2017, Mot\u00f6rhead released Under C\u00f6ver, a covers album featuring covers throughout Mot\u00f6rhead's history, along with covers only found on tribute albums, and new recordings.Former Mot\u00f6rhead guitarist \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke died on 10 January 2018 after a battle with pneumonia at the age of 67, making him the last member of the band's classic lineup (following Taylor and Lemmy) to die.Original Mot\u00f6rhead guitarist Larry Wallis died on 19 September 2019 at age 70 from an unknown cause.\n\n\n== Musical style ==\n\nIn a biography of the band, senior editor for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine, wrote: \"Mot\u00f6rhead's overwhelmingly loud and fast style of heavy metal was one of the most groundbreaking styles the genre had to offer in the late '70s\" and though \"Mot\u00f6rhead wasn't punk rock ... they were the first metal band to harness that energy and, in the process, they created speed metal and thrash metal.\" Whether they created these genres might be subject to debate, but Mot\u00f6rhead were unquestionably influential.\nAlthough Mot\u00f6rhead is often considered a heavy metal band, Lemmy always described Mot\u00f6rhead's music as simply \"rock and roll\". In 2011, he said: \"We were not heavy metal. We were a rock 'n' roll band. Still are. Everyone always describes us as heavy metal even when I tell them otherwise. Why won't people listen?\" In 2014, he reiterated to Der Spiegel that he did not particularly like heavy metal.Lemmy had stated that he generally felt more kinship with punk rockers than with heavy metal bands: Mot\u00f6rhead had engagements with fellow Brits, The Damned, with whom he played bass on a handful of late 1970s engagements, as well as having penned the song \"R.A.M.O.N.E.S.\" as a tribute to the Ramones. Mot\u00f6rhead, Lemmy stated, have more in common aesthetically with The Damned than Black Sabbath, and nothing whatsoever in common with Judas Priest. Lemmy said he felt little kinship with the speed metal bands Mot\u00f6rhead have inspired:\n\nThey've just got the wrong bit. They think that being fast and loud is the whole thing and it isn't. The guitar solos are not really difficult for a guitar player, it's just playing scales. To feel a solo and bend into it & I mean Hendrix is the best guitarist you've ever seen in your life. And he learned from people like Buddy Guy, Lightnin' Hopkins and people like that inspired Hendrix. To be influenced by something, you're gonna have to play it the same.\nThe NME stated that their brief solos were just long enough \"... to open another bottle of beer\", while a 1977 Stereo Review commented that \"they know they're like animals, and they don't want to appear any other way. In view of the many ugly frogs in heavy metal who think they are God's gift to womankind these Quasimodos even seem charming in their own way\". Mot\u00f6rhead's approach has not changed drastically over the band's career, though this is a deliberate choice: erstwhile Mot\u00f6rhead drummer Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor said that rock icons like Chuck Berry and Little Richard never drastically altered their style, and, like them, Mot\u00f6rhead preferred to play what they enjoyed and did best. This fondness for the first decade of rock and roll (mid-1950s to mid-1960s) is also reflected in some of Mot\u00f6rhead's occasional cover songs from that era.\nLemmy often played power chords in his basslines. When asked about whether he had begun as a rhythm guitarist, he stated:\n\nNo, I play a lot of notes, but I also play a lot of chords. And I play a lot of open strings. I just don't play like a bass player. There are complaints about me from time to time. It's not like having a bass player; it's like having a deep guitarist.\n\n\n== Name and logo ==\nThe name \"Mot\u00f6rhead\" is a reference to users of the drug amphetamine. The band's distinctive fanged-face logo, with its oversized boar's tusks, chains, and spikes, was created by artist Joe Petagno in 1977 for the cover of the Mot\u00f6rhead album and has appeared in many variations on covers of ensuing albums. The fanged face has been referred to variously as \"War-Pig\" and \"Snaggletooth\". The band's name is usually printed in a lowercase form of blackletter. The umlaut character \u00f6 is possibly derived from the similar \"heavy metal umlaut\" in the name of their 1975 acquaintances Blue \u00d6yster Cult. However, this umlaut does not alter the pronunciation of the band's name. When asked if Germans pronounced the band \"Motuuuurhead\", Lemmy answered \"No, they don't. I only put it in there to look mean\". \nSnaggletooth is the fanged face that serves as the symbol of Mot\u00f6rhead. Artist Joe Petagno drew it in 1977 for the cover of the band's debut album (with designer Phil Smee who turned it into a negative and did the lettering to complete the logo), having met Lemmy while doing some work with Hawkwind. Petagno stated:\n\nThe inspiration came from just being a naturally pissed-off bastard! And Lemmy's the same way! So it was bound to be an alchemal wedding of a more \"primordial nature\". I did a lot of research on skull types and found a cross-breed gorilla-wolf-dog combination would work nicely with some oversized boars horns. Lemmy added Helmet, chains, spit, spikes and grit.\nEddie Clarke was less sure about the imagery to begin with:\n\nI shuddered when I saw it the first time. I thought, \"Blimey, this ain't gonna go down that well\", because it was just way over the top, then. But I grew to love it ... [At first] it was not scary or horrifying, it would've been, in those days, deemed bad taste.\nIt has remained a symbol of Mot\u00f6rhead throughout the years, with Petagno creating many variations of Snaggletooth, or as some have called it and written it down as War-Pig, for the covers of ensuing albums. Only two of the original covers for Mot\u00f6rhead's 22 studio albums do not feature any variation of War-Pig on the cover: On Parole and Overnight Sensation (of which, On Parole was never sanctioned by the band), and was in any case reissued with a black Snaggletooth on a white background. Phil is wearing a Snaggletooth badge on the cover of Ace of Spades. The cover of \"Iron Fist\" depicts a metal gauntlet wearing four skull-shaped rings, one of which is Snaggletooth, while the rear of the album-sleeve shows a fully detailed 3-D metal sculpture of the symbol. Originally the Snaggletooth design included a swastika on one of the helmet's spikes. This was painted out on later re-releases of the albums on CD.\nOn 21 September 2007, Petagno announced that \"there will be no more \"HEADS\" from my hand\", citing irreconcilable differences between himself and the band's current management, Singerman Entertainment. Petagno stated:\n\nIt has been a long, exciting and industrious journey, full of art and intuition, difference in repetition, and creative innovation. I feel I accomplished something unique in Metal history over the last 31 years by breathing life again and again into a figment of my own imagination, an image or better an entity which has taken on a life of its own, which I actually believe goes beyond the music it was created to represent. I'm damn proud of that!\nIn reply, Lemmy stated:\n\nAs many of you know, we have been working with Joe Petagno for 31 years. We always treated Joe fairly, and I would like to stress that at no time did my manager demand what Joe thinks he demanded \u2014 it is all a colossal misunderstanding. We have always loved his artwork, obviously, and if he now decides to stop working with us, we have no choice but to use someone else. However ... if he will not discuss this personally and try to work things out, I think it's a great tragedy. If Joe continues with us, no one would be more delighted than me. If it's goodbye, Joe, I wish you well, but I hope, even at this stage, to be reconciled and continue our association.\n\n\n== Wrestling ==\nMot\u00f6rhead are well known in the professional wrestling world for performing wrestler Triple H's entrance music, \"The Game\", which he has used as his entrance music since January 2001. In addition to the song playing whenever Triple H appears on WWE programming such as Raw or SmackDown, and at other pay-per-view wrestling events, the band have performed the song live for him at WrestleMania X-Seven and WrestleMania 21. Their song \"Rock Out\" was also used as the theme song of the WWE pay-per-view Unforgiven in 2008. Mot\u00f6rhead also provided the entrance music for Triple H's faction Evolution, entitled \"Line in the Sand\". \"The Game\" was released on both the American version of the Hammered and WWF The Music, Vol. 5 albums, and \"Line in the Sand\" was released on the WWE ThemeAddict: The Music, Vol. 6 album. Mot\u00f6rhead have since performed a new entrance track for Triple H, entitled \"King of Kings\", which made its debut at WrestleMania 22. Triple H has also introduced the band in concert. Lemmy inspired Triple H's facial hair, and Triple H spoke at Lemmy's funeral.\n\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n\n\n=== Classic Rock Roll of Honour Awards ===\n\n\n=== Echo Awards ===\n\n\n=== Grammy Awards ===\n\n\n=== Kerrang Awards ===\n\n\n=== Metal Hammer Awards (Germany) ===\n\n\n=== Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards (United Kingdom) ===\n\n\n=== Revolver Music Awards ===\n\n\n=== Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ===\n\n\n== Members ==\n\n\n=== Final line-up ===\nIan \"Lemmy\" Kilmister \u2013 bass, lead vocals (1975\u20132015; his death)\nPhil \"Wizz\u00f6\" Campbell \u2013 guitars, backing vocals (1984\u20132015)\nMikkey Dee \u2013 drums (1992\u20132015)\n\n\n=== Previous members ===\nLarry Wallis \u2013 guitars, backing vocals (1975\u20131976; died 2019)\nLucas Fox \u2013 drums (1975)\nPhil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor \u2013 drums (1975\u20131984, 1987\u20131992; died 2015)\n\"Fast\" Eddie Clarke \u2013 guitars, backing vocals (1976\u20131982; died 2018)\nBrian \"Robbo\" Robertson \u2013 guitars, backing vocals (1982\u20131983)\nMichael \"W\u00fcrzel\" Burston \u2013 guitars, backing vocals (1984\u20131995; died 2011)\nPete Gill \u2013 drums (1984\u20131987)\n\n\n== Discography ==\n\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n\n\n== Tours ==\n\n\n== Filmography ==\n1987: Eat the Rich: soundtrack includes \"Nothing Up My Sleeve\", \"Built for Speed\", \"Orgasmatron\", \"Doctor Rock\", \"On the Road (live)\", \"Eat the Rich\" and \"Bess\" \u2013 New Line Home Entertainment. Halfway through shooting, the idea of gradually replacing the members of the ballroom band with Mot\u00f6rhead was hit upon. At first there are no Mot\u00f6rhead personnel, then Phil Campbell appears, followed by W\u00fcrzel and Phil Taylor. The scene involving Lemmy riding a motorcycle is played by a female stunt double as Lemmy was on tour with Mot\u00f6rhead in America at the time the scene had to be shot.\n2010: Lemmy (49% Motherf**ker. 51% Son of a Bitch.)

The band are often considered a precursor to the new wave of British heavy metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Though several guitarists and drummers have played in Mot\u00f6rhead, most of their best-selling albums and singles feature the work of Phil \"Philthy Animal\" Taylor on drums and \"Fast\" Eddie Clarke on guitars.\nMot\u00f6rhead released 22 studio albums, 10 live recordings, 12 compilation albums, and five EPs over a career spanning 40 years. Usually a power trio, they had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums Overkill, Bomber, Ace of Spades, and particularly the live album No Sleep 'til Hammersmith cemented Mot\u00f6rhead's reputation as a top-tier rock band. The band are ranked number 26 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. As of 2016, they have sold more than 15 million albums worldwide.Most often classified as heavy metal, Mot\u00f6rhead has been credited with being part of and influencing numerous musical scenes, thrash metal and speed metal especially. Lemmy, however, always insisted that they were a rock and roll band. He said that they had more in common with punk bands, but with their own unique sound, Mot\u00f6rhead is embraced in both punk and metal scenes. Their lyrics typically covered such topics as war, good versus evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, substance abuse, and, most famously, gambling, the latter theme being the focus of their hit song \"Ace of Spades\".Lemmy died on 28 December 2015 from cardiac arrhythmia and congestive heart failure, after being diagnosed with prostate cancer. The day after his death, drummer Mikkey Dee and guitarist Phil Campbell both confirmed that Mot\u00f6rhead had disbanded. By 2018, all three members of Mot\u00f6rhead's classic lineup (Lemmy, Taylor and Clarke) had died."}, "Heavy_metal_umlaut": {"links": ["Argentine heavy metal", "Biker metal", "Rrr\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6aaarrr", "Screaming ", "H\u00e4agen-Dazs", "Synth-metal", "Sensational spelling", "Foreign branding", "Speed metal", "Deathgrind", "H\u016bsker D\u016b?", "Die \u00c4rzte", "Folk metal", "Hard rock", "Left\u00f6ver Crack", "Fahrvergn\u00fcgen", "Girugamesh", "King Creosote", "Blackened death metal", "K\u00f6zi", "Skrillex", "Max\u00efmo Park", "Grotus", "Heavy metal drumming", "Yacht rock", "Viking metal", "Night on Br\u00f6cken", "Infern\u00e4l M\u00e4jesty", "Melodic metalcore", "Rusted Root", "Chinese heavy metal", "Neue Deutsche H\u00e4rte", "Kawaii metal", "Early Norwegian black metal scene", "Japanese metal", "Progressive metal", "Combining Diacritical Marks for Symbols", "Poseur", "Word play", "Ass\u00fcck", "Diary Of A Wimpy Kid", "M\u00fctiilation", "Znowhite", "Funk metal", "Beatdown hardcore", "Destr\u00f6yer six sixty-six", "Teutonic thrash metal", "Mathcore", "Umlaut ", "Heavy metal fashion", "Typeface", "Mot\u00f6r Militia", "Metalcore", "Cymbal choke", "Death growl", "Groove metal", "Heavy metal subculture", "Pirate metal", "Les L\u00e9gions Noires", "D\u00e4lek", "Unblack metal", "Power chord", "Frank Zappa", "T\u00f6rr", "Death in June", "Palm Desert Scene", "Pornogrind", "Technical death metal", "Glam metal", "New wave of American heavy metal", "Progressive rock", "Noise rock", "Death-doom", "Avant-garde metal", "Crossover thrash", "ISBN ", "Bloom County", "OWSLA", "Thrash metal", "Mad Decent", "Dotless i", "Rap metal", "Palm mute", "Crashd\u00efet", "Moott\u00f6rin Jyrin\u00e4", "N-diaeresis", "National Socialist black metal", "Gothic horror", "Progressive metalcore", "Brocken", "Sludge metal", "Aquarium ", "Hollywood Walk of Fame", "Celtic metal", "Cr\u00f6onchy Stars", "The Cr\u00fcxshadows", "Diplo", "Green Jell\u00ff", "List of heavy metal bands", "Heavy metal gallop", "Stoner rock", "Gwar", "Alternative rock", "Macron ", "New wave of British heavy metal", "Dynamite D\u00fcx", "Power metal", "Sign of the horns", "H\u00fcsker D\u00fc", "Symphonic metal", "Hungarian metal", "African heavy metal", "Michael McKean", "Singing", "Guitar Hero", "Blue \u00d6yster Cult", "Dimension Hatr\u00f6ss", "Voivod ", "Mockumentary", "Beow\u00fclf", "Sandy Pearlman", "Bay Area thrash metal", "David St. Hubbins", "Death 'n' roll", "Fates Warning", "Insidi\u00f6us T\u00f6rment", "List of heavy metal festivals", "Headbanging", "Nintendocore", "Grunge", "Sascha Baron Cohen", "Goregrind", "Br\u00fctal Legend", "Infernal ", "Jam band", "List of Diary of a Wimpy Kid characters", "Distortion ", "Grindcore", "Br\u00fcno", "Waiting for Daylight ", "Crust punk", "Diaeresis ", "Blackletter", "Heavy metal genres", "Extreme metal", "M\u00e4go de Oz", "L\u0227\u0227z Rockit", "Queensr\u00ffche", "Tonf\u00f6n", "\u00dcnloco", "Gothic metal", "Bangladeshi heavy metal", "Guitar solo", "Indigenous metal music", "Alternative metal", "Christian metal", "Drone metal", "Faux Cyrillic", "Dethklok", "Magma ", "Australian thrash metal", "Hardcore punk", "Medieval metal", "Dieselst\u00f6rmers", "The Onion", "Florida death metal", "Post-metal", "Vince Neil", "M\u00f6ng\u00f6l H\u00f6rde", "Djent", "Nu metal", "M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce", "Koba\u00efan", "Electronic dance music", "Red and anarchist black metal", "Richard Meltzer", "Barbari\u00f6n", "Shred guitar", "Heavy metal music", "Symphonic black metal", "Heavy metal lyrics", "Spinal Tap ", "\u00dc", "Punk rock", "\u00dcber", "Electronicore", "Moxy Fr\u00fcvous", "Deathcore", "Brazilian thrash metal", "Steampunk", "Death metal", "Guitar Hero II", "Allen Lanier", "Latin metal", "Industrial metal", "Diacritic", "Platformer", "Ukrainian metal", "Toilet B\u00f6ys", "Pagan metal", "L\u00e4ther", "Heavy metal guitar", "Mot\u00f6rhead", "Blast beat", "Richard Wagner", "Fuzz bass", "Black metal", "Constructed language", "Australian heavy metal", "Doom metal", "Jack \u00dc", "K\u00efll Cheerlead\u00ebr", "Neoclassical metal", "P\u00fcdelsi", "The Acc\u00fcsed", "This Is Spinal Tap", "Blackgaze", "Anarcho punk", "Melodic death metal", "Swedish death metal", "Heavy metal bass"], "content": "A metal umlaut is a diacritic that is sometimes used gratuitously or decoratively over letters in the names of hard rock or heavy metal bands\u2014for example, those of Blue \u00d6yster Cult, Queensr\u00ffche, Mot\u00f6rhead, the Acc\u00fcsed, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and the parody band Sp\u0131n\u0308al Tap.\n\n\n== Usage ==\nAmong English speakers, the use of umlaut marks and other diacritics with a blackletter typeface is a form of foreign branding which has been attributed to a desire for a \"gothic horror\" feel. The metal umlaut is not generally intended to affect the pronunciation of the band's name, unlike the umlaut in German (where the letters u and \u00fc represent distinct vowels) and the Scandinavian languages (where \u00e5, \u00e4 and a, \u00f6, \u00f8 and o are distinct letters).\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first gratuitous use of the umlaut in the name of a hard rock or metal band appears to have been by Blue \u00d6yster Cult in 1970. Blue \u00d6yster Cult's website states it was added by guitarist and keyboardist Allen Lanier, but rock critic Richard Meltzer claims to have suggested it to their producer and manager Sandy Pearlman just after Pearlman came up with the name: \"I said, 'How about an umlaut over the O?' Metal had a Wagnerian aspect anyway.\"\n\n\n== Reactions ==\nSpeakers of languages which use an umlaut to designate a pronunciation change may understand the intended effect, but perceive the result differently. When M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce visited Germany, singer Vince Neil said the band couldn't figure out why \"the crowds were chanting, 'Mutley Cruh! Mutley Cruh!'\"These decorative umlauts have been parodied in film and fiction; in an interview about the mockumentary film This Is Sp\u0131n\u0308al Tap, fictional rocker David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean) says, \"It's like a pair of eyes. You're looking at the umlaut, and it's looking at you.\" The heavy metal parody band Gwar parodied the use of metal umlauts in a lyric insert included with its first record, stylizing the song names with gratuitous diacritics.

It stars Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer as members of the fictional English heavy metal band Spinal Tap (who are characterized as \"one of England's loudest bands\"), and Reiner as Martin \"Marty\" Di Bergi, a documentary filmmaker who follows them on their American tour. The film satirizes the behavior and musical pretensions of rock bands and the hagiographic tendencies of rock documentaries such as The Song Remains the Same (1976), and The Last Waltz (1978) and follows the similar All You Need Is Cash (1978) by The Rutles. Most of its dialogue was improvised and dozens of hours were filmed. It produced the 1984 soundtrack album of the same name.\nThis Is Spinal Tap released to critical acclaim, but was only a modest success upon its initial release. However, it found greater success and amassed a cult following after it was released on VHS. In 2002, it was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress, and was selected for preservation by the National Film Registry. In 2016, film critic and author Jeremy Arnold chose it as one of the \"52 Must-See Movies\", describing it as \"one of the single most influential movies of the past thirty-five years\" and arguing that it \"effectively launched a new genre\u2014the mockumentary\".\n\n\n== Plot ==\nFilmmaker Martin \"Marty\" Di Bergi is creating a documentary that follows the English rock group Spinal Tap on their 1982 United States concert tour to promote their new album Smell the Glove. The band comprises childhood friends David St. Hubbins and Nigel Tufnel on vocals and guitar, bassist Derek Smalls, keyboardist Viv Savage, and drummer Mick Shrimpton. They were known as the Originals until they found out another band had that name so they changed their name to the New Originals. They had a hit as the Thamesmen with their single \"Gimme Some Money\", before changing their name to Spinal Tap and achieving a minor hit with the flower power anthem \"Listen to the Flower People\", and finally transitioning to heavy metal. Several of their previous drummers died in strange circumstances: spontaneous human combustion (Peter James Bond), a \"bizarre gardening accident\" (John \"Stumpy\" Pepys), and choking on vomit (Eric \"Stumpy Joe\" Childs - \"someone else's vomit\"). Segments of Marty's film show David and Nigel to be competent but dimwitted and immature musicians. At one point, Nigel shows Marty a custom-made amplifier that has volume knobs that go up to eleven, believing this would make their output louder.\n\nSeveral of the band's tour shows are canceled because of low ticket sales, and major retailers refuse to sell Smell the Glove because of its sexist cover art. Tensions arise between the band and their manager Ian Faith. David's girlfriend Jeanine, a manipulative yoga and astrology devotee, joins the group on tour and participates in band meetings, influencing their costumes and stage presentation. The band's distributor opts to release Smell the Glove with an entirely black cover without consulting the band. Despite their manager convincing the band that it would have a similar appeal to the White Album, the album fails to draw crowds to autograph sessions with the band.\nNigel suggests staging a lavish show, and asks Ian to order a Stonehenge megalith. However, Nigel, rushing a sketch on a napkin, mislabels its dimensions; the resulting prop is only 18 inches high rather than 18 feet, making the group a laughing stock. The group blames Ian, and when David suggests Jeanine should co-manage the group, Ian quits. The tour continues, rescheduled into smaller and smaller venues. Nigel is marginalized by Jeanine and David. At a gig at a United States Air Force base, Nigel is upset by an equipment malfunction and quits mid-performance. At their next gig, in an amphitheater at an amusement park, the band finds their repertoire is severely limited without Nigel, and improvise an experimental \"Jazz Odyssey\", which is poorly received.\nAt the last show of the tour, David and Derek consider exploring old side projects, such as a musical theatre production about Jack the Ripper. Before they go on stage, Nigel arrives to tell them that their song \"Sex Farm\" has become a major hit in Japan, and that Ian wants to arrange a tour there. As the band performs, David invites Nigel onstage, reuniting them, which excites everyone but Jeanine. With Ian reinstalled as manager, Spinal Tap performs a series of sold-out shows in Japan, despite the loss of drummer Mick, who explodes onstage.\n\n\n== Cast ==\n\n\n== Production ==\n\n\n=== Background ===\nMichael McKean and Christopher Guest met while in college in New York City in the late 1960s, and played music together. They worked with Harry Shearer and Rob Reiner on a TV pilot in 1978 for a sketch comedy show called The TV Show, which featured a parody rock band called Spinal Tap. During production of that sketch (while being burned with oil from on-stage effect) McKean and Guest began to improvise, inventing characters that became David St. Hubbins and Nigel Tufnel.Guest had previously played guitar under the name \"Nigel Tufnel\" on Michael McKean and David Lander's album Lenny and the Squigtones.\n\n\n=== Development ===\nThe entire film was shot in Los Angeles County, over a period of about five weeks. The visit to Elvis Presley's grave was filmed in a park in Altadena, with a mock-up of the grave site. The band sings \"Heartbreak Hotel\" because that was the only Elvis song for which producer Karen Murphy could obtain rights.Rob Reiner procured $60,000 from Marble Arch Productions to write a screenplay with McKean, Guest and Shearer, based on the Spinal Tap characters. They realized after a few days of writing that no script could capture the kind of movie they wanted to make, so they decided instead to shoot a short demo of the proposed film. They shopped the demo around to various studios but had no takers, until television writer-producer Norman Lear decided to back the project.Virtually all dialogue in the film is improvised. Actors were given outlines indicating where scenes would begin and end and character information necessary to avoid contradictions, but everything else came from the actors. As often as possible, the first take was used in the film, to capture natural reactions. Reiner wanted to list the entire cast as writers on the film to acknowledge their contributions, but the Writers' Guild objected, and so only he, Guest, McKean, and Shearer received writing credit.Veteran documentary cameraman Peter Smokler worked as cinematographer on the film. Smokler had great instincts for camera placement on set, according to Reiner, and is responsible for the film's handheld cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style\u2014although the cinematographer did not understand what was supposed to be funny about the movie. With Smokler behind the camera, the film was shot not as a feature film, but as a documentary, without a script or traditional shooting schedule. So much footage was filmed (over 100 hours) that it eventually required three editors to complete the film.Inspirations for the film included the documentaries Don't Look Back (1967), which was made about Bob Dylan, and The Last Waltz (1978), which was about The Band. The famous scene where Spinal Tap becomes lost backstage was inspired by a video of Tom Petty at a concert in Germany, walking through a series of doors trying to find the stage, but ending up on an indoor tennis court. Rob Reiner also went to see the English heavy metal band Judas Priest in concert as part of his preparation for the film. He later said, \"It physically hurt my chest. The reverberation in the hall was so strong that I couldn\u2019t stay there any longer.\" According to Harry Shearer in the Criterion edition DVD commentary, keyboard player John Sinclair had just returned from touring with Uriah Heep when principal photography was about to begin, and told them how they had been booked to play an air force base. They subsequently used the story in the film.\nIn post-production, Christopher Guest was very concerned with the verisimilitude of the finger positions on the band's instruments during the concert scenes, and even re-shot some footage after the movie was edited to ensure their hands appeared in sync with the music.The character of Jeanine, David's disruptive girlfriend, was added during the production to provide a story-line to the material\u2014in part to mollify studio executives who worried the movie would be plotless. Actress Victoria Tennant was briefly considered for the role, but June Chadwick won the part, thanks to her chemistry with the cast and her improvisation skills.Robert Bauer played the same character, Moke, in two Rob Reiner movies, The Sure Thing (1985) and this one.\n\n\n== Reception and legacy ==\n\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nSince its release, This Is Spinal Tap has received acclaim from critics and is widely regarded as one of the best films of 1984. The film holds a 95% \"Certified Fresh\" rating on the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes based on 66 reviews, with an average rating of 8.60/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"Smartly directed, brilliantly acted, and packed with endlessly quotable moments, This Is Spinal Tap is an all-time comedy classic.\"Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 4 stars out of 4 and wrote \"This Is Spinal Tap is one of the funniest, most intelligent, most original films of the year. The satire has a deft, wicked touch. Spinal Tap is not that much worse than, not that much different from, some successful rock bands.\" Ebert later placed the film on his ten best list of 1984 and would later include it in his Great Movies list in 2001 where he called it \"one of the funniest movies ever made\". Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune also awarded 4 out of 4 stars, writing, \"It is so well done, in fact, that unless you are clued in beforehand, it might take you a while to realize that the rock group under dissection in 'This Is Spinal Tap' does not really exist.\" Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised it as \"a witty, mischievous satire, and it's obviously a labor of love.\" In 2002, This Is Spinal Tap was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.Critics praised the film not only for its satire of the rollercoaster lifestyles of rock stars but also for its take on the non-fiction film genre. David Ansen from Newsweek called the film \"a satire of the documentary form itself, complete with perfectly faded clips from old TV shows of the band in its mod and flower-child incarnations\".Even with cameos from Billy Crystal and Patrick Macnee, Spinal Tap still managed to trick many of its moviegoers into believing the band existed. Reiner observed that \"when Spinal Tap initially came out, everybody thought it was a real band... the reason it did go over everybody's head was that it was very close to home\".\n\n\n=== Reactions from musicians ===\n\nThe film resonated with many musicians. Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, Jerry Cantrell, Dee Snider and Ozzy Osbourne all reported that, like Spinal Tap, they had become lost in confusing arena backstage hallways trying to make their way to the stage. When Dokken's George Lynch saw the film he is said to have exclaimed, \"That's us! How'd they make a movie about us?\"Glenn Danzig had a similar reaction when comparing Spinal Tap to his former band The Misfits saying, \"When I first saw Spinal Tap, I was like, 'Hey, this is my old band.'\"Lars Ulrich told a press conference crowd that the Metallica/Guns N' Roses 1992 tour seemed \"so Spinal Tap.\" This tour was in support of Metallica's own \"black album\". Shortly after the tour started, Metallica's James Hetfield suffered third degree burns on his arms after he stood too close to a pyrotechnic device. Earlier in that tour, backstage at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, Metallica met with Spinal Tap and discussed how their \"black album\" was a homage to Spinal Tap's Smell the Glove. This was captured on the Metallica DVD A Year and a Half in the Life of Metallica.\nIn a 1992 interview, Nirvana explain declining the offer to be a part of the film Singles. Kurt Cobain goes on to say, \"There's never really been a good documentary on rock and roll bands.\" Dave Grohl then cuts in saying, \"Except for Spinal Tap, [that] was the only rock movie worth watching,\" which Cobain agreed with, as well as mentioning Dont Look Back, by D.A. Pennebaker.\nAccording to a 1997 interview in Spin magazine with Aerosmith rhythm guitarist Brad Whitford, \"The first time Steven [Tyler] saw it he didn't see any humor in it.\" When the film was released, Aerosmith's most recent album, Rock in a Hard Place, depicted Stonehenge prominently on the cover.\nU2 guitarist The Edge said in the documentary It Might Get Loud that when he first saw Spinal Tap, \"I didn't laugh, I wept,\" because it summed up what a brainless swamp big-label rock music had become.\n\n\n=== Use of Spinal Tap as a descriptive term ===\nIt became a common insult for a pretentious band to be told they were funnier than Spinal Tap. As George Lynch put it, the more seriously a band took themselves, the more they resembled Spinal Tap. After seeing a 1986 performance by metal band Venom, singer Henry Rollins compared them to Spinal Tap. In their respective Behind the Music episodes, Quiet Riot's Rudy Sarzo and Ratt's Robbin Crosby compared their own bands to Spinal Tap to some extent. For example, as a parallel to the \"Shit Sandwich\" incident, Quiet Riot's fourth album Condition Critical was given the two-word review of \"Condition Terminal\" by J. D. Considine in Musician magazine. His review of the short-lived band GTR's eponymous debut LP in the same magazine was \"SHT\". R.E.M.'s Mike Mills described the band's early tours as \"very Spinal Tap\", citing, among other things, they had played at a United States Air Force base.\nJudas Priest, the heavy metal band that Rob Reiner saw in preparation for the film, has had many drummers in its career (eight in total), which the website Ultimate Classic Rock described as \"positively Spinal Tap-worthy\". Marillion guitarist Steve Rothery later described the run of five drummers in a year between his band's first two albums as \"like Spinal Tap\". In the Pearl Jam documentary Pearl Jam Twenty, the members jokingly refer to the fact that while the core lineup of the group has remained unchanged (singer Eddie Vedder, guitarists Mike McCready and Stone Gossard, and bassist Jeff Ament), the band has had five drummers. They describe this as \"very Spinal Tap of us\". In the documentary, a mock silent film called The Drummer Story is shown explaining what happened to their previous drummers. In it, one of them is almost eaten by a sea monster, only to be rescued by Eddie Vedder, playing a lifeguard.\nThe Canadian heavy metal band Anvil, whose drummer is named Robb Reiner, have been called \"the real Spinal Tap\" based on the misadventures depicted in their documentary Anvil! The Story of Anvil.\n\n\n=== Accolades ===\nIn 2008, Empire magazine ranked This Is Spinal Tap number 48 on its list of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time. The New York Times placed the film on their list of The Best 1000 Movies Ever Made. In January 2010, Total Film placed This Is Spinal Tap on its list of The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time. When Entertainment Weekly compiled their list of The 100 Greatest Movies of All Time, the publication included the film as \"just too beloved to ignore\". In 2011, Time Out London named it the best comedy film of all time. In November 2015, the film was ranked the 11th funniest screenplay by the Writers Guild of America in its list of 101 Funniest Screenplays.This Is Spinal Tap at 35: Tribeca Film Festival (The Guardian)The film is recognized by American Film Institute in this list:\n\n2000: AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs \u2013 #29\n\n\n== Lawsuit ==\nOn October 17, 2016, actor Harry Shearer filed a $125 million fraud and breach of contract lawsuit against both StudioCanal, the successor in interest to Embassy Pictures, and Vivendi, which owns the studio. Shearer claimed that he and the other co-stars of the film received only $179 for sales of merchandise and music over the prior three decades. Shearer's lawsuit was specifically directed at StudioCanal by ordering the studio to terminate the copyright to This Is Spinal Tap. In February 2017, Shearer's co-stars Christopher Guest and Michael McKean, as well as the film's director Rob Reiner, joined the lawsuit against StudioCanal and Vivendi, seeking $400 million in damages. In the same month, Vivendi made an attempt to motion to the court to dismiss the case. In September 2017, a judge dismissed Shearer, Reiner and McKean from the case. In October 2017, Spinal Tap revised their case by adding Universal Music Group (UMG, another division of Vivendi, whose Polydor label released the film's soundtrack) as a defendant, as well as the right to reclaim their copyrights to the film, its songs and characters.In August 2018, Judge Dolly Gee ruled that Guest, Reiner, McKean and Shearer may pursue the fraud claim against Vivendi.The case related to sales of the soundtrack was settled out of court by November 2019, with UMG retaining the distribution rights but with the music rights eventually returning to Shearer, Guest, and McKean in the future. A settlement between Vivendi, StudioCanal, and the cast on the merchandising aspect was reached in September 2020 with final details to be resolved in the following months.\n\n\n== Home media ==\nThis Is Spinal Tap was first released on VHS in 1984 by Embassy Home Entertainment, and in 1994 as part of the Criterion Collection on LaserDisc under the title, This Is Spinal Tap: Special Edition. It has also been released twice on DVD.\nThe first DVD release was a 1998 Criterion edition in letterbox format which used supplemental material from the 1994 Criterion LaserDisc release. It is their only double sided DVD in their catalogue. It included an audio commentary track with Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer; a second audio commentary track with Rob Reiner, Karen Murphy, Robert Leighton and Kent Beyda; 79 minutes of deleted scenes; Spinal Tap: The Final Tour, the original twenty-minute short they shot to pitch the film; two trailers that feature Rob Reiner showing a film about cheese rolling (because \"Spinal Tap\" itself was still in the editing room); a TV promo, Heavy Metal Memories; and a music video for \"Hell Hole\". Sales of this edition were discontinued after only two years and the DVD has become a valuable collector's item. Much of this material had appeared on a 1994 CD-ROM by The Voyager Company that included the entire film in QuickTime format.\nIn 2000, MGM Home Entertainment released a special edition with more or less the same extras from the Criterion edition, plus a new audio commentary track with Guest, McKean and Shearer performing in character throughout, commenting on the film entirely in their fictional alter-egos, and often disapproving of how the film presents them; 70 minutes of deleted scenes (some of which were not on the Criterion DVD); a new short, Catching Up with Marty Di Bergi (where it is revealed that the members of Spinal Tap were very disappointed in Di Bergi for making a \"hatchet job\" of their film); the Heavy Metal Memories promo and six additional TV promos; music videos for \"Gimme Some Money\", \"Listen to the Flower People\" and \"Big Bottom\"; and segments of Spinal Tap appearing on The Joe Franklin Show. The special features were produced by Automat Pictures. However, this version of the film was missing the subtitles that appear throughout the film (for example, introducing band members, other personnel, and location names) and did not include the commentaries from the Criterion edition. The MGM DVD is missing the subtitles burned into the film; they have been replaced with player generated subtitles.\nA 25th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray Disc release was released on July 28, 2009. It includes all bonus features from the MGM DVD plus an interview with Nigel about Stonehenge and Stonehenge from the band's Live Earth performance. It does not include the commentaries from the Criterion Collection DVD, even though MGM had stated that they would be included in the earliest press release for the Blu-ray version (most likely due to legal issues), and does not feature a \"create your own avatars\" element teased in publicity. However, this version does restore the subtitles that introduce band members/locales/events/etc. that were missing from MGM's DVD. The alternative, Region B, UK edition of this version additionally features a new hour-long documentary featuring famous fans, the \"Bitch School\" promo, the EPK for the \"Back From The Dead\" album, an interview with the late Reg Presley discussing the influence of the Troggs tapes on the film, and the first hour (ending with an abrupt edit) of The Return Of Spinal Tap. It does however lose the Di Bergi short and the Joe Franklin clip.\n\n\n== Appearances in other media ==\n\nHarry Shearer, who played Derek Smalls, went on to become one of the main voice artists on The Simpsons, providing voices for Principal Skinner, Mr. Burns, Waylon Smithers, Ned Flanders and many others. The members of Spinal Tap reprised their roles  in \"The Otto Show\", first playing on a concert attended by Bart and Milhouse which escalates into a riot after the band's early exit, then having their tour bus run off the road by Otto in the school bus.\nThe Internet Movie Database normally only allows users to rate films up to ten stars, but specifically for Spinal Tap, the site allows users to rate the film eleven stars, referencing the \"Up to eleven\" scene. On IGN, This Is Spinal Tap was the only DVD\u2014and seemingly the only thing reviewed on IGN\u2014to get 11 out of 10. This scene was also used in some news reports on the death of James Charles \"Jim\" Marshall, founder of the famous amplifier company whose equipment is featured in the scene. Richard D. Titus, UX&D Controller for the BBC, adopted a Spinal Tap-inspired suggestion from a colleague that the BBC iPlayer should have a volume control that goes to eleven. The term has entered the vernacular, as with an autistic's description of sensory overload vis-\u00e0-vis a neurotypical's routine filtering.Fran Drescher reprised the role of Bobbi Flekman during the fifth season of her hit television sitcom The Nanny; it was the season's third episode, titled \"The Bobbi Flekman Story\". In the episode, Flekman is now a record label producer for The Brian Setzer Orchestra, and an ex-business partner of character Maxwell Sheffield (Charles Shaughnessy). Drescher's regular character Fran Fine believes Flekman is attempting to seduce Sheffield, and impersonates her to stop it.Outside the world of music, J. K. Rowling cited Spinal Tap's series of drummers as an inspiration for the Harry Potter series, in which something bad happens to every teacher of Defence against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts, causing them to leave the job without completing a full school year.A biographical comic book was released in 2018, That Was Spinal Tap, telling both the fictional story of the band and the real-life tale of the actors and others who created the characters and music. It was scripted by Rock 'N' Roll Comics co-creator Jay Allen Sanford.\n\n\n== Related works ==\n\"Christmas with the Devil\", 1984 follow-up single.\nInside Spinal Tap (1985), a rare companion book by Peter Occhiogrosso. In 1992 this was revised and expanded exclusively for the UK market.\nBoth Michael McKean and Harry Shearer appeared in character as David St. Hubbins and Derek Smalls as part of the all-star charity group Hear 'n Aid. The group issued the single \"Stars\" in early 1986 which charted in the UK, hitting #26. St. Hubbins and Smalls were two of the dozens of well-known heavy metal artists who participated and were credited on the record, and can be seen in the video.\nBreak Like the Wind (1992), album.\n\"The Otto Show\", a 1992 episode of The Simpsons which features Spinal Tap.\nA two-hour, made-for-TV sequel, The Return of Spinal Tap, was broadcast and released on video in 1992 to promote Break Like the Wind. It consisted mostly of footage from an actual Spinal Tap concert at the Royal Albert Hall. In it the \"Stonehenge\" joke from the original movie is referenced, as the new, large prop is instead too big to get into the venue.\nThis Is Spinal Tap: The Official Companion (ISBN 0-7475-4218-X) was published in 2000. It featured a \"Tapistory\", full transcript of the film (including outtakes), a discography, lyrics and an A\u2013Z of the band. This book largely recycles material from the Peter Occhiogrosso book and Criterion DVD commentaries.\nBack from the Dead, 2009 album and DVD.\nUnplugged and Unwigged, 2009 live DVD of Guest, McKean, and Shearer performing songs from their various works.\nSmalls Change (Meditations on Ageing), 2018 solo album by Shearer as Derek Smalls.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nThe Big Picture (1989)\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThis Is Spinal Tap at IMDb\nThis Is Spinal Tap at the TCM Movie Database\nThis Is Spinal Tap at AllMovie\nThis Is Spinal Tap an essay by Peter Occhiogrosso at the Criterion Collection", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Wiktionary-logo-en-v2.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/06/Spinal_Tap_-_Up_to_Eleven.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/Spinal_Tap_2.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c8/Thisisspinaltapposter.jpg"], "summary": "This Is Spinal Tap (stylized as This Is Sp\u0131n\u0308al Tap: A Rockumentary by Martin Di Bergi) is a 1984 American mockumentary film co-written and directed by Rob Reiner in his directorial debut. It stars Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer as members of the fictional English heavy metal band Spinal Tap (who are characterized as \"one of England's loudest bands\"), and Reiner as Martin \"Marty\" Di Bergi, a documentary filmmaker who follows them on their American tour. The film satirizes the behavior and musical pretensions of rock bands and the hagiographic tendencies of rock documentaries such as The Song Remains the Same (1976), and The Last Waltz (1978) and follows the similar All You Need Is Cash (1978) by The Rutles. Most of its dialogue was improvised and dozens of hours were filmed. It produced the 1984 soundtrack album of the same name.\nThis Is Spinal Tap released to critical acclaim, but was only a modest success upon its initial release. However, it found greater success and amassed a cult following after it was released on VHS. In 2002, it was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress, and was selected for preservation by the National Film Registry. In 2016, film critic and author Jeremy Arnold chose it as one of the \"52 Must-See Movies\", describing it as \"one of the single most influential movies of the past thirty-five years\" and arguing that it \"effectively launched a new genre\u2014the mockumentary\"."}, "Spontaneous_human_combustion": {"links": ["Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society", "Self-immolation", "Toast of London", "Fallacy", "Prometheus Books", "Selective evidence", "Transcranial magnetic stimulation", "Oxidation-reduction", "Psychic", "Remote viewing", "St. Petersburg Times", "Junk science", "Ideomotor phenomenon", "Red Dwarf", "Anomalistics", "Ouija", "The X-Files", "Scientific skepticism", "Ebbw Vale", "Urban legend", "Cryptozoology", "JSTOR ", "Forensic Science International", "Mockumentary", "Forteana", "Ufology", "Argument from ignorance", "Spiritualism", "Communal reinforcement", "Carnegie Hall", "Parapsychology", "Anomalous experiences", "Extrasensory perception", "Herman Melville", "Ectoplasm ", "List of prizes for evidence of the paranormal", "Lucid dream", "Crystal gazing", "Scientific method", "Hypotheses", "Royal Society", "Electronic voice phenomenon", "Wick effect", "Fire Force", "Ketosis", "The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe", "Michael Harrison ", "Kevin Wilson ", "Spirit world ", "Mediumship", "This Is Sp\u0131n\u0308al Tap", "Paranormal", "Frederick Marryat", "John E.

In addition to reported cases, descriptions of the alleged phenomenon appear in literature, and both types have been observed to share common characteristics in terms of circumstances and the remains of the victim.\nScientific investigations have attempted to analyze reported instances of SHC and have resulted in hypotheses regarding potential causes and mechanisms, including victim behavior and habits, alcohol consumption and proximity to potential sources of ignition, as well as the behavior of fires that consume melted fats. Natural explanations, as well as unverified natural phenomena, have been proposed to explain reports of SHC. Current scientific consensus is that purported cases of SHC involve overlooked external sources of ignition.\n\n\n== Overview ==\n\"Spontaneous human combustion\" refers to the death from a fire originating without an apparent external source of ignition; a belief that the fire starts within the body of the victim. This idea and the term \"spontaneous human combustion\" were both first proposed in 1746 by Paul Rolli, a Fellow of the Royal Society, in an article published in the Philosophical Transactions concerning the mysterious death of Countess Cornelia Zangheri Bandi. Writing in The British Medical Journal in 1938, coroner Gavin Thurston describes the phenomenon as having \"apparently attracted the attention not only of the medical profession but of the laity one hundred years ago\" (referring to a fictional account published in 1834 in the Frederick Marryat cycle). In his 1995 book Ablaze!, Larry E. Arnold, a director of ParaScience International, wrote that there had been about 200 cited reports of spontaneous human combustion worldwide over a period of around 300 years.\n\n\n=== Characteristics ===\nThe topic received coverage in the British Medical Journal in 1938. An article by L. A. Parry cited an 1823-published book Medical Jurisprudence, which stated that commonalities among recorded cases of spontaneous human combustion included the following characteristics:\n\n\"[...]the recorded cases have these things in common:\nthe victims are chronic alcoholics;\nthey are usually elderly females;\nthe body has not burned spontaneously, but some lighted substance has come into contact with it;\nthe hands and feet usually fall off;\nthe fire has caused very little damage to combustible things in contact with the body;\nthe combustion of the body has left a residue of greasy and fetid ashes, very offensive in odour.\"\nAlcoholism is a common theme in early SHC literary references, in part because some Victorian era physicians and writers believed spontaneous human combustion was the result of alcoholism.\n\n\n== Scientific investigation ==\nAn extensive two-year research project, involving thirty historical cases of alleged SHC, was conducted in 1984 by science investigator Joe Nickell and forensic analyst John F. Fischer. Their lengthy, two-part report was published in the journal of the International Association of Arson Investigators,:\u200a3\u201311\u200a as well as part of a book. Nickell has written frequently on the subject, appeared on television documentaries, conducted additional research, and lectured at the New York State Academy of Fire Science at Montour Falls, New York, as a guest instructor.\nNickell and Fischer's investigation, which looked at cases in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, showed that the burned bodies were close to plausible sources for the ignition: candles, lamps, fireplaces, and so on. Such sources were often omitted from published accounts of these incidents, presumably to deepen the aura of mystery surrounding an apparently \"spontaneous\" death. The investigations also found that there was a correlation between alleged SHC deaths and the victim's intoxication (or other forms of incapacitation) which could conceivably have caused them to be careless and unable to respond properly to an accident. Where the destruction of the body was not particularly extensive, a primary source of combustible fuel could plausibly have been the victim's clothing or a covering such as a blanket or comforter.\nHowever, where the destruction was extensive, additional fuel sources were involved, such as chair stuffing, floor coverings, the flooring itself, and the like. The investigators described how such materials helped to retain melted fat, which caused more of the body to be burned and destroyed, yielding still more liquified fat, in a cyclic process known as the \"wick effect\" or the \"candle effect\".\nAccording to Nickell and Fischer's investigation, nearby objects often remained undamaged because fire tends to burn upward, but burns laterally with some difficulty. The fires in question are relatively small, achieving considerable destruction by the wick effect, and relatively nearby objects may not be close enough to catch fire themselves (much as one can closely approach a modest campfire without burning). As with other mysteries, Nickell and Fischer cautioned against \"single, simplistic explanation for all unusual burning deaths\" but rather urged investigating \"on an individual basis\".:\u200a169\u200aNeurologist Steven Novella has said that skepticism about spontaneous human combustion is now bleeding over into becoming popular skepticism about spontaneous combustion.A 2002 study by Angi M. Christensen of the University of Tennessee cremated both healthy and osteoporotic samples of human bone and compared the resulting color changes and fragmentation. The study found that osteoporotic bone samples \"consistently displayed more discoloration and a greater degree of fragmentation than healthy ones.\" The same study found that when human tissue is burned, the resulting flame produces a small amount of heat, indicating that fire is unlikely to spread from burning tissue.\n\n\n== Suggested explanations ==\nWhile scientific consensus is that incidents which might appear as spontaneous combustion did in fact have an external source of ignition\u2014and that the physical possibility of spontaneous human combustion without an external ignition source is extremely implausible\u2014some pseudoscientific hypotheses have been presented which attempt to explain how SHC might occur without an external flame source. Benjamin Radford, science writer and deputy editor of the science magazine Skeptical Inquirer, casts doubt on the plausibility of spontaneous human combustion: \"If SHC is a real phenomenon (and not the result of an elderly or infirm person being too close to a flame source), why doesn't it happen more often? There are 5 billion people in the world [\u200a\u2060today in 1987\u200a\u2060], and yet we don't see reports of people bursting into flame while walking down the street, attending football games, or sipping a coffee at a local Starbucks.\" Paranormal researcher Brian Dunning states that SHC stories \"are simply the rare cases where a natural death in isolation has been followed by a slow combustion from some nearby source of ignition.\" He further suggested that reports of people suddenly aflame should be called \"unsolved deaths by fire\", stating that an unknown cause did not necessarily imply that the fire lacked an external ignition source.\n\n\n=== Natural explanations ===\nAlmost all postulated cases of SHC involve persons with low mobility due to advanced age or obesity, along with poor health. Victims show a high likelihood of having died in their sleep, or of having been unable to move once they had caught fire.\nCigarettes are often seen as the source of fire, as the improper disposal of smoking materials causes one in every four fire deaths in the United States. Natural causes such as heart attacks may lead to the victim dying, subsequently dropping the cigarette, which after a period of smouldering can ignite the victim's clothes.\nThe \"wick effect\" hypothesis suggests that a small external flame source, such as a burning cigarette, chars the clothing of the victim at a location, splitting the skin and releasing subcutaneous fat, which is in turn absorbed into the burned clothing, acting as a wick. This combustion can continue for as long as the fuel is available. This hypothesis has been successfully tested with pig tissue and is consistent with evidence recovered from cases of human combustion. The human body typically has enough stored energy in fat and other chemical stores to fully combust the body; even lean people have several pounds of fat in their tissues. This fat, once heated by the burning clothing, wicks into the clothing much as candle wax is drawn into a lit candle wick, providing the fuel needed to keep the wick burning. The protein in the body also burns, but provides less energy than fat, with the water in the body being the main impediment to combustion. However, slow combustion, lasting hours, gives the water time to evaporate slowly. In an enclosed area, such as a house, this moisture will recondense nearby, possibly on windows. Feet don't typically burn because they often have the least fat; hands also have little fat, but may burn if resting on the abdomen, which provides all of the necessary fat for combustion.\nScalding can cause burn-like injuries, sometimes leading to death, without setting fire to clothing. Although not applicable in cases where the body is charred and burnt, this has been suggested as a cause in at least one claimed SHC-like event.\nBrian J. Ford has suggested that ketosis, possibly caused by alcoholism or low-carb dieting, produces acetone, which is highly flammable and could therefore lead to apparently spontaneous combustion.\nSHC can be confused with self-immolation as a form of suicide. In the West, self-immolation accounts for 1% of suicides, while Radford claims in developing countries the figure can be as high as 40%.\nSometimes there are reasonable explanations for the deaths, but proponents ignore official autopsies and contradictory evidence in favor of anecdotal accounts and personal testimonies.\nMast cell researcher Lawrence Afrin, M.D., posits that a rare condition called mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) may be the cause of the phenomenon. In MCAS, mast cells spontaneously release over 200 inflammatory molecules known as mediators, including the substance noradrenaline (norepinephrine). Afrin describes a case report of a man with MCAS who grew ill and appeared to \"smoke\" in the presence of several witnesses. Afrin writes that the release of large amounts of norepinephrine, or perhaps another mast cell-derived substance, could turn on a regulatory protein called UCP-1 in greater-than-normal amounts. UCP-1 causes adipose oxidization to be released as heat. Adipose tissue is a known repository of mast cells. Under the right circumstances, a sudden flood of norepinephrine released from adipose mast cells could activate the UCP-1 \"switch\" and cause heat generation in excess of 90 degrees Celsius. Once the adipose tissue were ignited, it would in theory burn itself out, inclusive of bone marrow.\n\n\n=== Alternative theories ===\nLarry E. Arnold in his 1995 book Ablaze! proposed a pseudoscientific new subatomic particle, which he called \"pyrotron\".:\u200a99\u2013106\u200a Arnold also wrote that the flammability of a human body could be increased by certain circumstances, like increased alcohol in the blood.:\u200a84\u200a He further proposed that extreme stress could be the trigger that starts many combustions.:\u200a163\u200a This process may use no external oxygen to spread throughout the body, since it may not be an \"oxidation-reduction\" reaction; however, no reaction mechanism has been proposed. Researcher Joe Nickell has criticised Arnold's hypotheses as based on selective evidence and argument from ignorance.\nIn his 1976 book Fire From Heaven, UK writer Michael Harrison suggests that SHC is connected to poltergeist activity because, he argues, \"the force which activates the 'poltergeist' originates in, and is supplied by, a human being\". Within the concluding summary, Harrison writes: \"SHC, fatal or non-fatal, belongs to the extensive range of poltergeist phenomena.\"\nJohn Abrahamson suggested that ball lightning could account for spontaneous human combustion. \"This is circumstantial only, but the charring of human limbs seen in a number of ball lightning cases are [sic] very suggestive that this mechanism may also have occurred where people have had limbs combusted,\" says Abrahamson.\n\n\n== Notable examples ==\nOn 2 July 1951, Mary Reeser, a 67-year-old woman, was found burned to death in her house after her landlady realised that the house's doorknob was unusually warm. The landlady notified the police, and upon entering the home they found Reeser's remains completely burned into ash, with only one leg remaining. The chair she was sitting in was also destroyed. Reeser took sleeping pills and was also a smoker. Despite its proliferation in popular culture, the contemporary FBI investigation ruled out the possibility of SHC. A common theory was that she was smoking a cigarette after taking sleeping pills and then fell asleep while still holding the burning cigarette, which could have ignited her gown, ultimately leading to her death. Her daughter-in-law stated, \"The cigarette dropped to her lap. Her fat was the fuel that kept her burning. The floor was cement, and the chair was by itself. There was nothing around her to burn\".Margaret Hogan, an 89-year-old widow who lived alone in a house on Prussia Street, Dublin, Ireland, was found burned almost to the point of complete destruction on 28 March 1970. Plastic flowers on a table in the centre of the room had been reduced to liquid and a television with a melted screen sat 12 feet from the armchair in which the ashen remains were found; otherwise, the surroundings were almost untouched. Her two feet, and both legs from below the knees, were undamaged. A small coal fire had been burning in the grate when a neighbour left the house the previous day; however, no connection between this fire and that in which Mrs. Hogan died could be found. An inquest, held on 3 April 1970, recorded death by burning, with the cause of the fire listed as \"unknown\".Henry Thomas, a 73-year-old man, was found burned to death in the living room of his council house on the Rassau estate in Ebbw Vale, South Wales, in 1980. His entire body was incinerated, leaving only his skull and a portion of each leg below the knee. The feet and legs were still clothed in socks and trousers. Half of the chair in which he had been sitting was also destroyed. Police forensic officers decided that the incineration of Thomas was due to the wick effect.In December 2010, the death of Michael Faherty, a 76-year-old man in County Galway, Ireland, was recorded as \"spontaneous combustion\" by the coroner. The doctor, Ciaran McLoughlin, made this statement at the inquiry into the death: \"This fire was thoroughly investigated and I'm left with the conclusion that this fits into the category of spontaneous human combustion, for which there is no adequate explanation.\"\n\n\n== Cultural references ==\nIn the novel Redburn by Herman Melville published in 1849, a sailor, Miguel Saveda, is consumed by \"animal combustion\" whilst in a drunken stupor on the return voyage from Liverpool to New York (chapter 48).\nIn the novel Bleak House by Charles Dickens, the character Mr. Krook dies of spontaneous combustion at the end of Part X. Dickens researched the details of a number of contemporary accounts of spontaneous human combustion before writing that part of the novel and, after receiving criticism from a scientist friend suggesting he was perpetuating a \"vulgar error\", cites some of these cases in Part XI and again in the preface to the one-volume edition. The death of Mr. Krook has been described as \"the most famous case in literature\" of spontaneous human combustion.\nIn the comic story \"The Glenmutchkin Railway\" by William Edmondstoune Aytoun, published in 1845 in  Blackwood's Magazine, one of the railway directors, Sir Polloxfen Tremens, is said to have died of spontaneous combustion.\nIn the 1984 mockumentary This Is Sp\u0131n\u0308al Tap, about the fictional heavy metal band Spinal Tap, two of the band's former drummers are said to have died in separate on-stage spontaneous human combustion incidents.\nIn the episode \"Confidence and Paranoia\" of British science fiction series Red Dwarf, a character called the Mayor of Warsaw is said to have spontaneously exploded in the 16th century and briefly appears in a vision by an unconscious Lister (the main protagonist of the series) where he explodes in front of Rimmer (his hologram bunkmate).\nIn the beginning of the 1998 video game Parasite Eve, an entire audience in Carnegie Hall spontaneously combusts (except for Aya Brea, the protagonist of the game) during an opera presentation as the main actress Melissa Pierce starts to sing.\nThis phenomenon is mentioned in the episodes Soft Light and Trevor of the TV series The X-Files.\nIn the eighth episode of the second season of the American action police procedural television series NCIS, a case is investigated where the victim at first glance seems to have been killed by spontaneous human combustion.\nIn episode 2 of the second season of the TV series Picket Fences, the town's mayor is shown to have been killed by spontaneous combustion.\nThe manga and anime series Fire Force focuses on the main protagonists fighting humans who have this phenomenon.\nIn the fourth episode of the first season of the English comedic drama series \"Toast of London\", Toast decides to finish his book by having the main character spontaneously combust. When bringing it to his literary agent, the laziness of his ending enrages her to the point of spontaneous combustion in front of Toast.\nThe adult animated series South Park devoted a whole episode, titled \"Spontaneous Combustion\", to spontaneous human combustion.\nIn Kevin Wilson's short story \"Blowing Up on the Spot\" (from his collection Tunneling to the Center of the Earth), the protagonist's parents died from a \"double spontaneous human combustion.\"\nIn his 2010 collection \"The Spot\", American writer David Means has the droll story \"Facts Toward Understanding the Spontaneous Human Combustion of Errol McGee\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nExploding animal\nFan death\nPyrokinesis\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSpontaneous Human Combustion:The Germany Incident\nSpontaneous Human Combustion: A Brief History\nNew light on human torch mystery\nSHC: Reports in Chronological Order", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/archive/8/8a/20190821112659%21OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg"], "summary": "Spontaneous human combustion (SHC) is the pseudoscientific concept of the combustion of a living (or recently deceased) human body without an apparent external source of ignition.
