"8 mm film is a motion picture film format in which the film strip is eight millimeters wide. It exists in two main versions \u2013 the original standard 8 mm film, also known as regular 8 mm, and Super 8. Although both standard 8 mm and Super 8 are 8 mm wide, Super 8 has a larger image area because of its smaller and more widely spaced perforations.\nThere are also two other varieties of Super 8 \u2013 Single 8 mm and Straight-8 \u2013 that require different cameras, but produce a final film with the same dimensions."
