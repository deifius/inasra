tangent) to a plane curve at a given point is the straight line that \"just touches\" the curve at that point. Leibniz defined it as the line through a pair of infinitely close points on the curve. More precisely, a straight line is said to be a tangent of a curve y = f(x) at a point x = c if the line passes through the point (c, f(c)) on the curve and has slope f'(c), where f' is the derivative of f. A similar definition applies to space curves and curves in n-dimensional Euclidean space.\nAs it passes through the point where the tangent line and the curve meet, called the point of tangency, the tangent line is \"going in the same direction\" as the curve, and is thus the best straight-line approximation to the curve at that point.\nThe tangent line to a point on a differentiable curve can also be thought of as the graph of the affine function that best approximates the original function at the given point.Similarly, the tangent plane to a surface at a given point is the plane that \"just touches\" the surface at that point. The concept of a tangent is one of the most fundamental notions in differential geometry and has been extensively generalized; see Tangent space.\nThe word \"tangent\" comes from the Latin tangere, \"to touch\".\n\n\n== History ==\nEuclid makes several references to the tangent (\u1f10\u03c6\u03b1\u03c0\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7 ephaptom\u00e9n\u0113) to a circle in book III of the Elements  (c. 300 BC). In Apollonius' work Conics (c. 225 BC) he defines a tangent as being a line such that no other straight line could\nfall between it and the curve.\nArchimedes (c.\u2009 287 \u2013 c. \u2009212 BC) found the tangent to an Archimedean spiral by considering the path of a point moving along the curve.In the 1630s Fermat developed the technique of adequality to calculate tangents and other problems in analysis and used this to calculate tangents to the parabola. The technique of adequality is similar to taking the difference between \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        +\n        h\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x+h)}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f(x)}\n   and dividing by a power of \n  \n    \n      \n        h\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h}\n  . Independently Descartes used his method of normals based on the observation that the radius of a circle is always normal to the circle itself.These methods led to the development of differential calculus in the 17th century. Many people contributed. Roberval discovered a general method of drawing tangents, by considering a curve as described by a moving point whose motion is the resultant of several simpler motions.Ren\u00e9-Fran\u00e7ois de Sluse and Johannes Hudde found algebraic algorithms for finding tangents. Further developments included those of John Wallis and Isaac Barrow, leading to the theory of Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz.\nAn 1828 definition of a tangent was \"a right line which touches a curve, but which when produced, does not cut it\". This old definition prevents inflection points from having any tangent. It has been dismissed and the modern definitions are equivalent to those of Leibniz, who defined the tangent line as the line through a pair of infinitely close points on the curve.\n\n\n== Tangent line to a curve ==\n\nThe intuitive notion that a tangent line \"touches\" a curve can be made more explicit by considering the sequence of straight lines (secant lines) passing through two points, A and B, those that lie on the function curve. The tangent at A is the limit when point B approximates or tends to A. The existence and uniqueness of the tangent line depends on a certain type of mathematical smoothness, known as \"differentiability.\" For example, if two circular arcs meet at a sharp point (a vertex) then there is no uniquely defined tangent at the vertex because the limit of the progression of secant lines depends on the direction in which \"point B\" approaches the vertex.\nAt most points, the tangent touches the curve without crossing it (though it may, when continued, cross the curve at other places away from the point of tangent). A point where the tangent (at this point) crosses the curve is called an inflection point. Circles, parabolas, hyperbolas and ellipses do not have any inflection point, but more complicated curves do have, like the graph of a cubic function, which has exactly one inflection point, or a sinusoid, which has two inflection points per each period of the sine.\nConversely, it may happen that the curve lies entirely on one side of a straight line passing through a point on it, and yet this straight line is not a tangent line. This is the case, for example, for a line passing through the vertex of a triangle and not intersecting it otherwise\u2014where the tangent line does not exist for the reasons explained above. In convex geometry, such lines are called supporting lines.\n\n\n=== Analytical approach ===\nThe geometrical idea of the tangent line as the limit of secant lines serves as the motivation for analytical methods that are used to find tangent lines explicitly. The question of finding the tangent line to a graph, or the tangent line problem, was one of the central questions leading to the development of calculus in the 17th century. In the second book of his Geometry, Ren\u00e9 Descartes said of the problem of constructing the tangent to a curve, \"And I dare say that this is not only the most useful and most general problem in geometry that I know, but even that I have ever desired to know\".\n\n\n==== Intuitive description ====\nSuppose that a curve is given as the graph of a function, y = f(x). To find the tangent line at the point p = (a, f(a)), consider another nearby point q = (a + h, f(a + h)) on the curve. The slope of the secant line passing through p and q is equal to the difference quotient\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              f\n              (\n              a\n              +\n              h\n              )\n              \u2212\n              f\n              (\n              a\n              )\n            \n            h\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}}.}\n  As the point q approaches p, which corresponds to making h smaller and smaller, the difference quotient should approach a certain limiting value k, which is the slope of the tangent line at the point p. If k is known, the equation of the tangent line can be found in the point-slope form:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        \u2212\n        f\n        (\n        a\n        )\n        =\n        k\n        (\n        x\n        \u2212\n        a\n        )\n        .\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y-f(a)=k(x-a).\\,}\n  \n\n\n==== More rigorous description ====\nTo make the preceding reasoning rigorous, one has to explain what is meant by the difference quotient approaching a certain limiting value k. The precise mathematical formulation was given by Cauchy in the 19th century and is based on the notion of limit. Suppose that the graph does not have a break or a sharp edge at p and it is neither plumb nor too wiggly near p. Then there is a unique value of k such that, as h approaches 0, the difference quotient gets closer and closer to k, and the distance between them becomes negligible compared with the size of h, if h is small enough. This leads to the definition of the slope of the tangent line to the graph as the limit of the difference quotients for the function f. This limit is the derivative of the function f at x = a, denoted f \u2032(a). Using derivatives, the equation of the tangent line can be stated as follows:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        =\n        f\n        (\n        a\n        )\n        +\n        \n          f\n          \u2032\n        \n        (\n        a\n        )\n        (\n        x\n        \u2212\n        a\n        )\n        .\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a).\\,}\n  Calculus provides rules for computing the derivatives of functions that are given by formulas, such as the power function, trigonometric functions, exponential function, logarithm, and their various combinations. Thus, equations of the tangents to graphs of all these functions, as well as many others, can be found by the methods of calculus.\n\n\n==== How the method can fail ====\nCalculus also demonstrates that there are functions and points on their graphs for which the limit determining the slope of the tangent line does not exist. For these points the function f is non-differentiable. There are two possible reasons for the method of finding the tangents based on the limits and derivatives to fail: either the geometric tangent exists, but it is a vertical line, which cannot be given in the point-slope form since it does not have a slope, or the graph exhibits one of three behaviors that precludes a geometric tangent.\nThe graph y = x1/3 illustrates the first possibility:  here the difference quotient at a = 0 is equal to h1/3/h = h\u22122/3, which becomes very large as h approaches 0. This curve has a tangent line at the origin that is vertical.\nThe graph y = x2/3 illustrates another possibility: this graph has a cusp at the origin. This means that, when h approaches 0, the difference quotient at a = 0 approaches plus or minus infinity depending on the sign of x. Thus both branches of the curve are near to the half vertical line for which y=0, but none is near to the negative part of this line. Basically, there is no tangent at the origin in this case, but in some context one may consider this line as a tangent, and even, in algebraic geometry, as a double tangent.\nThe graph y = |x| of the absolute value function consists of two straight lines with different slopes joined at the origin. As a point q approaches the origin from the right, the secant line always has slope 1. As a point q approaches the origin from the left, the secant line always has slope \u22121. Therefore, there is no unique tangent to the graph at the origin. Having two different (but finite) slopes is called a corner.\nFinally, since differentiability implies continuity, the contrapositive states discontinuity implies non-differentiability. Any such jump or point discontinuity will have no tangent line. This includes cases where one slope approaches positive infinity while the other approaches negative infinity, leading to an infinite jump discontinuity\n\n\n=== Equations ===\nWhen the curve is given by y = f(x) then the slope of the tangent is \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              d\n              y\n            \n            \n              d\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {dy}{dx}},}\n  \nso by the point\u2013slope formula the equation of the tangent line at (X, Y) is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        \u2212\n        Y\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              d\n              y\n            \n            \n              d\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n        (\n        X\n        )\n        \u22c5\n        (\n        x\n        \u2212\n        X\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y-Y={\\frac {dy}{dx}}(X)\\cdot (x-X)}\n  where (x, y) are the coordinates of any point on the tangent line, and where the derivative is evaluated at \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        =\n        X\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x=X}\n  .When the curve is given by y = f(x), the tangent line's equation can also be found by using polynomial division to divide \n  \n    \n      \n        f\n        \n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle f\\,(x)}\n   by \n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        x\n        \u2212\n        X\n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x-X)^{2}}\n  ; if the remainder is denoted by \n  \n    \n      \n        g\n        (\n        x\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle g(x)}\n  , then the equation of the tangent line is given by\n\n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        =\n        g\n        (\n        x\n        )\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y=g(x).}\n  When the equation of the curve is given in the form  f(x, y) = 0 then the value of the slope can be found by implicit differentiation, giving\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              d\n              y\n            \n            \n              d\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \u2212\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \u2202\n                f\n              \n              \n                \u2202\n                x\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \u2202\n                f\n              \n              \n                \u2202\n                y\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {dy}{dx}}=-{\\frac {\\frac {\\partial f}{\\partial x}}{\\frac {\\partial f}{\\partial y}}}.}\n  The equation of the tangent line at a point (X,Y) such that f(X,Y) = 0 is then\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \u2202\n              f\n            \n            \n              \u2202\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n        (\n        X\n        ,\n        Y\n        )\n        \u22c5\n        (\n        x\n        \u2212\n        X\n        )\n        +\n        \n          \n            \n              \u2202\n              f\n            \n            \n              \u2202\n              y\n            \n          \n        \n        (\n        X\n        ,\n        Y\n        )\n        \u22c5\n        (\n        y\n        \u2212\n        Y\n        )\n        =\n        0.\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\partial f}{\\partial x}}(X,Y)\\cdot (x-X)+{\\frac {\\partial f}{\\partial y}}(X,Y)\\cdot (y-Y)=0.}\n  This equation remains true if \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \u2202\n              f\n            \n            \n              \u2202\n              y\n            \n          \n        \n        (\n        X\n        ,\n        Y\n        )\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\partial f}{\\partial y}}(X,Y)=0}\n   but \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \u2202\n              f\n            \n            \n              \u2202\n              x\n            \n          \n        \n        (\n        X\n        ,\n        Y\n        )\n        \u2260\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\partial f}{\\partial x}}(X,Y)\\neq 0}\n   (in this case the slope of the tangent is infinite).

Since any point can be made the origin by a change of variables (or by translating the curve) this gives a method for finding the tangent lines at any singular point.\nFor example, the equation of the lima\u00e7on trisectrix shown to the right is\n\n  \n    \n      \n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          y\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        2\n        a\n        x\n        \n          )\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        (\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          y\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n        .\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle (x^{2}+y^{2}-2ax)^{2}=a^{2}(x^{2}+y^{2}).\\,}\n  Expanding this and eliminating all but terms of degree 2 gives\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          a\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        (\n        3\n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        \n          y\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        )\n        =\n        0\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a^{2}(3x^{2}-y^{2})=0\\,}\n  which, when factored, becomes\n\n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        =\n        \u00b1\n        \n          \n            3\n          \n        \n        x\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y=\\pm {\\sqrt {3}}x.}\n  So these are the equations of the two tangent lines through the origin.When the curve is not self-crossing, the tangent at a reference point may still not be uniquely defined because the curve is not differentiable at that point although it is differentiable elsewhere. In this case the left and right derivatives are defined as the limits of the derivative as the point at which it is evaluated approaches the reference point from respectively the left (lower values) or the right (higher values). For example, the curve y = |x | is not differentiable at x = 0: its left and right derivatives have respective slopes \u22121 and 1; the tangents at that point with those slopes are called the left and right tangents.Sometimes the slopes of the left and right tangent lines are equal, so the tangent lines coincide. This is true, for example, for the curve y = x 2/3, for which both the left and right derivatives at x = 0 are infinite; both the left and right tangent lines have equation x = 0.\n\n\n== Tangent circles ==\n\nTwo circles of non-equal radius, both in the same plane, are said to be tangent to each other if they meet at only one point.

Leibniz defined it as the line through a pair of infinitely close points on the curve. More precisely, a straight line is said to be a tangent of a curve y = f(x) at a point x = c if the line passes through the point (c, f(c)) on the curve and has slope f'(c), where f' is the derivative of f. A similar definition applies to space curves and curves in n-dimensional Euclidean space.\nAs it passes through the point where the tangent line and the curve meet, called the point of tangency, the tangent line is \"going in the same direction\" as the curve, and is thus the best straight-line approximation to the curve at that point.\nThe tangent line to a point on a differentiable curve can also be thought of as the graph of the affine function that best approximates the original function at the given point.Similarly, the tangent plane to a surface at a given point is the plane that \"just touches\" the surface at that point. The concept of a tangent is one of the most fundamental notions in differential geometry and has been extensively generalized; see Tangent space.\nThe word \"tangent\" comes from the Latin tangere, \"to touch\".\n\n"}, "Algebraic_geometry": {"links": ["Jean-Pierre Serre", "Algebraic statistics", "Function field of an algebraic variety", "Formal scheme", "Mikhail Leonidovich Gromov", "Aryabhata", "Numerical analysis", "Daniel Pedoe", "Tesseract", "Affine geometry", "David A.

Modern algebraic geometry is based on the use of abstract algebraic techniques, mainly from commutative algebra, for solving  geometrical problems about these sets of zeros.\nThe fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry are algebraic varieties, which are geometric manifestations of solutions of systems of polynomial equations. Examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are: plane algebraic curves, which include lines, circles, parabolas, ellipses, hyperbolas, cubic curves like elliptic curves, and quartic curves like lemniscates and Cassini ovals. A point of the plane belongs to an algebraic curve if its coordinates satisfy a given polynomial equation. Basic questions involve the study of the points of special interest like the singular points, the inflection points and the points at infinity. More advanced questions involve the topology of the curve and relations between the curves given by different equations.\nAlgebraic geometry occupies a central place in modern mathematics and has multiple conceptual connections with such diverse fields as complex analysis, topology and number theory. Initially a study of systems of polynomial equations in several variables, the subject of algebraic geometry starts where equation solving leaves off, and it becomes even more important to understand the intrinsic properties of the totality of solutions of a system of equations, than to find a specific solution; this leads into some of the deepest areas in all of mathematics, both conceptually and in terms of technique.\nIn the 20th century, algebraic geometry split into several subareas.\n\nThe mainstream of algebraic geometry is devoted to the study of the complex points of the algebraic varieties and more generally to the points with coordinates in an algebraically closed field.\nReal algebraic geometry is the study of the real points of an algebraic variety.\nDiophantine geometry and, more generally, arithmetic geometry is the study of the points of an algebraic variety with coordinates in fields that are not algebraically closed and occur in algebraic number theory, such as the field of rational numbers, number fields, finite fields, function fields, and p-adic fields.\nA large part of singularity theory is devoted to the singularities of algebraic varieties.\nComputational algebraic geometry is an area that has emerged at the intersection of algebraic geometry and computer algebra, with the rise of computers. It consists mainly of algorithm design and software development for the study of properties of explicitly given algebraic varieties.Much of the development of the mainstream of algebraic geometry in the 20th century occurred within an abstract algebraic framework, with increasing emphasis being placed on \"intrinsic\" properties of algebraic varieties not dependent on any particular way of embedding the variety in an ambient coordinate space; this parallels developments in topology, differential and complex geometry. One key achievement of this abstract algebraic geometry is Grothendieck's scheme theory which allows one to use sheaf theory to study algebraic varieties in a way which is very similar to its use in the study of differential and analytic manifolds. This is obtained by extending the notion of point: In classical algebraic geometry, a point of an affine variety may be identified, through Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, with a maximal ideal of the coordinate ring, while the points of the corresponding affine scheme are all prime ideals of this ring. This means that a point of such a scheme may be either a usual point or a subvariety. This approach also enables a unification of the language and the tools of classical algebraic geometry, mainly concerned with complex points, and of algebraic number theory. Wiles' proof of the longstanding conjecture called Fermat's last theorem is an example of the power of this approach.\n\n\n== Basic notions ==\n\n\n=== Zeros of simultaneous polynomials ===\n\nIn classical algebraic geometry, the main objects of interest are the vanishing sets of collections of polynomials, meaning the set of all points that simultaneously satisfy one or more polynomial equations.

In classical algebraic geometry, this field was always the complex numbers C, but many of the same results are true if we assume only that k is algebraically closed. We consider the affine space of dimension n over k, denoted An(k) (or more simply An, when k is clear from the context). When one fixes a coordinate system, one may identify An(k) with kn. The purpose of not working with kn is to emphasize that one \"forgets\" the vector space structure that kn carries.\nA function f : An \u2192 A1 is said to be polynomial (or regular) if it can be written as a polynomial, that is, if there is a polynomial p in k[x1,...,xn] such that f(M) = p(t1,...,tn) for every point M with coordinates (t1,...,tn) in An. The property of a function to be polynomial (or regular) does not depend on the choice of a coordinate system in An.\nWhen a coordinate system is chosen, the regular functions on the affine n-space may be identified with the ring of polynomial functions in n variables over k. Therefore, the set of the regular functions on An is a ring, which is denoted k[An].\nWe say that a polynomial vanishes at a point if evaluating it at that point gives zero. Let S be a set of polynomials in k[An]. The vanishing set of S (or vanishing locus or zero set) is the set V(S) of all points in An where every polynomial in S vanishes. Symbolically,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        V\n        (\n        S\n        )\n        =\n        {\n        (\n        \n          t\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \u2026\n        ,\n        \n          t\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        )\n        \u2223\n        p\n        (\n        \n          t\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        ,\n        \u2026\n        ,\n        \n          t\n          \n            n\n          \n        \n        )\n        =\n        0\n        \n           for all \n        \n        p\n        \u2208\n        S\n        }\n        .\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V(S)=\\{(t_{1},\\dots ,t_{n})\\mid p(t_{1},\\dots ,t_{n})=0{\\text{ for all }}p\\in S\\}.\\,}\n  A subset of An which is V(S), for some S, is called an algebraic set. The V stands for variety (a specific type of algebraic set to be defined below).\nGiven a subset U of An, can one recover the set of polynomials which generate it? If U is any subset of An, define I(U) to be the set of all polynomials whose vanishing set contains U. The I stands for ideal: if two polynomials f and g both vanish on U, then f+g vanishes on U, and if h is any polynomial, then hf vanishes on U, so I(U) is always an ideal of the polynomial ring k[An].\nTwo natural questions to ask are:\n\nGiven a subset U of An, when is U = V(I(U))?\nGiven a set S of polynomials, when is S = I(V(S))?The answer to the first question is provided by introducing the Zariski topology, a topology on An whose closed sets are the algebraic sets, and which directly reflects the algebraic structure of k[An]. Then U = V(I(U)) if and only if U is an algebraic set or equivalently a Zariski-closed set. The answer to the second question is given by Hilbert's Nullstellensatz. In one of its forms, it says that I(V(S)) is the radical of the ideal generated by S. In more abstract language, there is a Galois connection, giving rise to two closure operators; they can be identified, and naturally play a basic role in the theory; the example is elaborated at Galois connection.\nFor various reasons we may not always want to work with the entire ideal corresponding to an algebraic set U. Hilbert's basis theorem implies that ideals in k[An] are always finitely generated.\nAn algebraic set is called irreducible if it cannot be written as the union of two smaller algebraic sets. Any algebraic set is a finite union of irreducible algebraic sets and this decomposition is unique. Thus its elements are called the irreducible components of the algebraic set. An irreducible algebraic set is also called a variety. It turns out that an algebraic set is a variety if and only if it may be defined as the vanishing set of a prime ideal of the polynomial ring.\nSome authors do not make a clear distinction between algebraic sets and varieties and use irreducible variety to make the distinction when needed.\n\n\n=== Regular functions ===\n\nJust as continuous functions are the natural maps on topological spaces and smooth functions are the natural maps on differentiable manifolds, there is a natural class of functions on an algebraic set, called regular functions or polynomial functions. A regular function on an algebraic set V contained in An is the restriction to V of a regular function on An. For an algebraic set defined on the field of the complex numbers, the regular functions are smooth and even analytic.\nIt may seem unnaturally restrictive to require that a regular function always extend to the ambient space, but it is very similar to the situation in a normal topological space, where the Tietze extension theorem guarantees that a continuous function on a closed subset always extends to the ambient topological space.\nJust as with the regular functions on affine space, the regular functions on V form a ring, which we denote by k[V]. This ring is called the coordinate ring of V.\nSince regular functions on V come from regular functions on An, there is a relationship between the coordinate rings. Specifically, if a regular function on V is the restriction of two functions f and g in k[An], then f \u2212 g is a polynomial function which is null on V and thus belongs to I(V). Thus k[V] may be identified with k[An]/I(V).\n\n\n=== Morphism of affine varieties ===\nUsing regular functions from an affine variety to A1, we can define regular maps from one affine variety to another. First we will define a regular map from a variety into affine space: Let V be a variety contained in An. Choose m regular functions on V, and call them f1, ..., fm. We define a regular map f from V to Am by letting f = (f1, ..., fm). In other words, each fi determines one coordinate of the range of f.\nIf V\u2032 is a variety contained in Am, we say that f is a regular map from V to V\u2032 if the range of f is contained in V\u2032.\nThe definition of the regular maps apply also to algebraic sets.\nThe regular maps are also called morphisms, as they make the collection of all affine algebraic sets into a category, where the objects are the affine algebraic sets and the morphisms are the regular maps. The affine varieties is a subcategory of the category of the algebraic sets.\nGiven a regular map g from V to V\u2032 and a regular function f of k[V\u2032], then f \u2218 g \u2208 k[V]. The map f \u2192 f \u2218 g is a ring homomorphism from k[V\u2032] to k[V]. Conversely, every ring homomorphism from k[V\u2032] to k[V] defines a regular map from V to V\u2032. This defines an equivalence of categories between the category of algebraic sets and the opposite category of the finitely generated reduced k-algebras. This equivalence is one of the starting points of scheme theory.\n\n\n=== Rational function and birational equivalence ===\n\nIn contrast to the preceding sections, this section concerns only varieties and not algebraic sets. On the other hand, the definitions extend naturally to projective varieties (next section), as an affine variety and its projective completion have the same field of functions.\nIf V is an affine variety, its coordinate ring is an integral domain and has thus a field of fractions which is denoted k(V) and called the field of the rational functions on V or, shortly, the function field of V. Its elements are the restrictions to V of the rational functions over the affine space containing V. The domain of a rational function f is not V but the complement of the subvariety (a hypersurface) where the denominator of f vanishes.\nAs with regular maps, one may define a rational map from a variety V to a variety V'. As with the regular maps, the rational maps from V to V' may be identified to the field homomorphisms from k(V') to k(V).\nTwo affine varieties are birationally equivalent if there are two rational functions between them which are inverse one to the other in the regions where both are defined. Equivalently, they are birationally equivalent if their function fields are isomorphic.\nAn affine variety is a rational variety if it is birationally equivalent to an affine space. This means that the variety admits a rational parameterization, that is a parametrization with rational functions. For example, the circle of equation \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          y\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        1\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}-1=0}\n   is a rational curve, as it has the parametric equation\n\n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              2\n              \n              t\n            \n            \n              1\n              +\n              \n                t\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x={\\frac {2\\,t}{1+t^{2}}}}\n  \n\n  \n    \n      \n        y\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              1\n              \u2212\n              \n                t\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              1\n              +\n              \n                t\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle y={\\frac {1-t^{2}}{1+t^{2}}}\\,,}\n  which may also be viewed as a rational map from the line to the circle.\nThe problem of resolution of singularities is to know if every algebraic variety is birationally equivalent to a variety whose projective completion is nonsingular (see also smooth completion). It was solved in the affirmative in characteristic 0 by Heisuke Hironaka in 1964 and is yet unsolved in finite characteristic.\n\n\n=== Projective variety ===\n\nJust as the formulas for the roots of second, third, and fourth degree polynomials suggest extending real numbers to the more algebraically complete setting of the complex numbers, many properties of algebraic varieties suggest extending affine space to a more geometrically complete projective space. Whereas the complex numbers are obtained by adding the number i, a root of the polynomial x2 + 1, projective space is obtained by adding in appropriate points \"at infinity\", points where parallel lines may meet.\nTo see how this might come about, consider the variety V(y \u2212 x2). If we draw it, we get a parabola. As x goes to positive infinity, the slope of the line from the origin to the point (x, x2) also goes to positive infinity. As x goes to negative infinity, the slope of the same line goes to negative infinity.\nCompare this to the variety V(y \u2212 x3). This is a cubic curve. As x goes to positive infinity, the slope of the line from the origin to the point (x, x3) goes to positive infinity just as before. But unlike before, as x goes to negative infinity, the slope of the same line goes to positive infinity as well; the exact opposite of the parabola. So the behavior \"at infinity\" of V(y \u2212 x3) is different from the behavior \"at infinity\" of V(y \u2212 x2).\nThe consideration of the projective completion of the two curves, which is their prolongation \"at infinity\" in the projective plane, allows us to quantify this difference: the point at infinity of the parabola is a regular point, whose tangent is the line at infinity, while the point at infinity of the cubic curve is a cusp. Also, both curves are rational, as they are parameterized by x, and the Riemann-Roch theorem implies that the cubic curve must have a singularity, which must be at infinity, as all its points in the affine space are regular.\nThus many of the properties of algebraic varieties, including birational equivalence and all the topological properties, depend on the behavior \"at infinity\" and so it is natural to study the varieties in projective space. Furthermore, the introduction of projective techniques made many theorems in algebraic geometry simpler and sharper: For example, B\u00e9zout's theorem on the number of intersection points between two varieties can be stated in its sharpest form only in projective space. For these reasons, projective space plays a fundamental role in algebraic geometry.\nNowadays, the projective space Pn of dimension n is usually defined as the set of the lines passing through a point, considered as the origin, in the affine space of dimension n + 1, or equivalently to the set of the vector lines in a vector space of dimension n + 1. When a coordinate system has been chosen in the space of dimension n + 1, all the points of a line have the same set of coordinates, up to the multiplication by an element of k. This defines the homogeneous coordinates of a point of Pn as a sequence of n + 1 elements of the base field k, defined up to the multiplication by a nonzero element of k (the same for the whole sequence).\nA polynomial in n + 1 variables vanishes at all points of a line passing through the origin if and only if it is homogeneous. In this case, one says that the polynomial vanishes at the corresponding point of Pn. This allows us to define a projective algebraic set in Pn as the set V(f1, ..., fk), where a finite set of homogeneous polynomials {f1, ..., fk}  vanishes. Like for affine algebraic sets, there is a bijection between the projective algebraic sets and the reduced homogeneous ideals which define them. The projective varieties are the projective algebraic sets whose defining ideal is prime. In other words, a projective variety is a projective algebraic set, whose homogeneous coordinate ring is an integral domain, the projective coordinates ring being defined as the quotient of the graded ring or the polynomials in n + 1 variables by the homogeneous (reduced) ideal defining the variety. Every projective algebraic set may be uniquely decomposed into a finite union of projective varieties.\nThe only regular functions which may be defined properly on a projective variety are the constant functions. Thus this notion is not used in projective situations. On the other hand, the field of the rational functions or function field  is a useful notion, which, similarly to the affine case, is defined as the set of the quotients of two homogeneous elements of the same degree in the homogeneous coordinate ring.\n\n\n== Real algebraic geometry ==\n\nReal algebraic geometry is the study of the real points of algebraic varieties.\nThe fact that the field of the real numbers is an ordered field cannot be ignored in such a study. For example, the curve of equation \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          x\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          y\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        a\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}-a=0}\n   is a circle if \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        >\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a>0}\n  , but does not have any real point if \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n        <\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a<0}\n  . It follows that real algebraic geometry is not only the study of the real algebraic varieties, but has been generalized to the study of the semi-algebraic sets, which are the solutions of systems of polynomial equations and polynomial inequalities. For example, a branch of the hyperbola of equation \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        y\n        \u2212\n        1\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle xy-1=0}\n   is not an algebraic variety, but is a semi-algebraic set defined by \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        y\n        \u2212\n        1\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle xy-1=0}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        >\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x>0}\n   or by \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        y\n        \u2212\n        1\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle xy-1=0}\n   and \n  \n    \n      \n        x\n        +\n        y\n        >\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle x+y>0}\n  .\nOne of the challenging problems of real algebraic geometry is the unsolved Hilbert's sixteenth problem: Decide which respective positions are possible for the ovals of a nonsingular plane curve of degree 8.\n\n\n== Computational algebraic geometry ==\nOne may date the origin of computational algebraic geometry to meeting EUROSAM'79 (International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation) held at Marseille, France in June 1979. At this meeting,\n\nDennis S. Arnon showed that George E. Collins's Cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) allows the computation of the topology of semi-algebraic sets,\nBruno Buchberger presented the Gr\u00f6bner bases and his algorithm to compute them,\nDaniel Lazard presented a new algorithm for solving systems of homogeneous polynomial equations with a computational complexity which is essentially polynomial in the expected number of solutions and thus simply exponential in the number of the unknowns. This algorithm is strongly related with Macaulay's multivariate resultant.Since then, most results in this area are related to one or several of these items either by using or improving one of these algorithms, or by finding algorithms whose complexity is simply exponential in the number of the variables.\nA body of mathematical theory complementary to symbolic methods called numerical algebraic geometry has been developed over the last several decades.  The main computational method is homotopy continuation.  This supports, for example, a model of floating point computation for solving problems of algebraic geometry.\n\n\n=== Gr\u00f6bner basis ===\n\nA Gr\u00f6bner basis is a system of generators of a polynomial ideal whose computation allows the deduction of many properties of the affine algebraic variety defined by the ideal.\nGiven an ideal I defining an algebraic set V:\n\nV is empty (over an algebraically closed extension of the basis field), if and only if the Gr\u00f6bner basis for any monomial ordering is reduced to {1}.\nBy means of the Hilbert series one may compute the dimension and the degree of V from any Gr\u00f6bner basis of I for a monomial ordering refining the total degree.\nIf the dimension of V is 0, one may compute the points (finite in number) of V from any Gr\u00f6bner basis of I (see Systems of polynomial equations).\nA Gr\u00f6bner basis computation allows one to remove from V all irreducible components which are contained in a given hypersurface.\nA Gr\u00f6bner basis computation allows one to compute the Zariski closure of the image of V by the projection on the k first coordinates, and the subset of the image where the projection is not proper.\nMore generally Gr\u00f6bner basis computations allow one to compute the Zariski closure of the image and the critical points of a rational function of V into another affine variety.Gr\u00f6bner basis computations do not allow one to compute directly the primary decomposition of I nor the prime ideals defining the irreducible components of V, but most algorithms for this involve Gr\u00f6bner basis computation. The algorithms which are not based on Gr\u00f6bner bases use regular chains but may need Gr\u00f6bner bases in some exceptional situations.\nGr\u00f6bner bases are deemed to be difficult to compute. In fact they may contain, in the worst case, polynomials whose degree is doubly exponential in the number of variables and a number of polynomials which is also doubly exponential. However, this is only a worst case complexity, and the complexity bound of Lazard's algorithm of 1979 may frequently apply. Faug\u00e8re F5 algorithm realizes this complexity, as it may be viewed as an improvement of Lazard's 1979 algorithm. It follows that the best implementations allow one to compute almost routinely with algebraic sets of degree more than 100. This means that, presently, the difficulty of computing a Gr\u00f6bner basis is strongly related to the intrinsic difficulty of the problem.\n\n\n=== Cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) ===\nCAD is an algorithm which was introduced in 1973 by G. Collins to implement with an acceptable complexity the Tarski\u2013Seidenberg theorem on quantifier elimination over the real numbers.\nThis theorem concerns the formulas of the first-order logic whose atomic formulas are polynomial equalities or inequalities between polynomials with real coefficients. These formulas are thus the formulas which may be constructed from the atomic formulas by the logical operators and (\u2227), or (\u2228), not (\u00ac), for all (\u2200) and exists (\u2203). Tarski's theorem asserts that, from such a formula, one may compute an equivalent formula without quantifier (\u2200, \u2203).\nThe complexity of CAD is doubly exponential in the number of variables. This means that CAD allows, in theory, to solve every problem of real algebraic geometry which may be expressed by such a formula, that is almost every problem concerning explicitly given varieties and semi-algebraic sets.\nWhile Gr\u00f6bner basis computation has doubly exponential complexity only in rare cases, CAD has almost always this high complexity. This implies that, unless if most polynomials appearing in the input are linear, it may not solve problems with more than four variables.\nSince 1973, most of the research on this subject is devoted either to improve CAD or to find alternative algorithms in special cases of general interest.\nAs an example of the state of art, there are efficient algorithms to find at least a point in every connected component of a semi-algebraic set, and thus to test if a semi-algebraic set is empty. On the other hand, CAD is yet, in practice, the best algorithm to count the number of connected components.\n\n\n=== Asymptotic complexity vs. practical efficiency ===\nThe basic general algorithms of computational geometry have a double exponential worst case complexity. More precisely, if d is the maximal degree of the input polynomials and n the number of variables, their complexity is at most \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          d\n          \n            \n              2\n              \n                c\n                n\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d^{2^{cn}}}\n   for some constant c, and, for some inputs, the complexity is at least \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          d\n          \n            \n              2\n              \n                \n                  c\n                  \u2032\n                \n                n\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d^{2^{c'n}}}\n   for another constant c\u2032.\nDuring the last 20 years of the 20th century, various algorithms have been introduced to solve specific subproblems with a better complexity. Most of these algorithms have a complexity \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          d\n          \n            O\n            (\n            \n              n\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d^{O(n^{2})}}\n  .Among these algorithms which solve a sub problem of the problems solved by Gr\u00f6bner bases, one may cite testing if an affine variety is empty and solving nonhomogeneous polynomial systems which have a finite number of solutions. Such algorithms are rarely implemented because, on most entries Faug\u00e8re's F4 and F5 algorithms have a better practical efficiency and probably a similar or better complexity (probably because the evaluation of the complexity of Gr\u00f6bner basis algorithms on a particular class of entries is a difficult task which has been done only in a few special cases).\nThe main algorithms of real algebraic geometry which solve a problem solved by CAD are related to the topology of semi-algebraic sets. One may cite counting the number of connected components, testing if two points are in the same components or computing a Whitney stratification of a real algebraic set. They have a complexity of\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          d\n          \n            O\n            (\n            \n              n\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d^{O(n^{2})}}\n  , but the constant involved by O notation is so high that using them to solve any nontrivial problem effectively solved by CAD, is impossible even if one could use all the existing computing power in the world. Therefore, these algorithms have never been implemented and this is an active research area to search for algorithms with have together a good asymptotic complexity and a good practical efficiency.\n\n\n== Abstract modern viewpoint ==\nThe modern approaches to algebraic geometry redefine and effectively extend the range of basic objects in various levels of generality to schemes, formal schemes, ind-schemes, algebraic spaces, algebraic stacks and so on. The need for this arises already from the useful ideas within theory of varieties, e.g. the formal functions of Zariski can be accommodated by introducing nilpotent elements in structure rings; considering spaces of loops and arcs, constructing quotients by group actions and developing formal grounds for natural intersection theory and deformation theory lead to some of the further extensions.\nMost remarkably, in the late 1950s, algebraic varieties were subsumed into Alexander Grothendieck's concept of a scheme. Their local objects are affine schemes or prime spectra which are locally ringed spaces which form a category which is antiequivalent to the category of commutative unital rings, extending the duality between the category of affine algebraic varieties over a field k, and the category of finitely generated reduced k-algebras. The gluing is along Zariski topology; one can glue within the category of locally ringed spaces, but also, using the Yoneda embedding, within the more abstract category of presheaves of sets over the category of affine schemes. The Zariski topology in the set theoretic sense is then replaced by a Grothendieck topology. Grothendieck introduced Grothendieck topologies having in mind more exotic but geometrically finer and more sensitive examples than the crude Zariski topology, namely the \u00e9tale topology, and the two flat Grothendieck topologies: fppf and fpqc; nowadays some other examples became prominent including Nisnevich topology. Sheaves can be furthermore generalized to stacks in the sense of Grothendieck, usually with some additional representability conditions leading to Artin stacks and, even finer, Deligne\u2013Mumford stacks, both often called algebraic stacks.\nSometimes other algebraic sites replace the category of affine schemes. For example, Nikolai Durov has introduced commutative algebraic monads as a generalization of local objects in a generalized algebraic geometry. Versions of a tropical geometry, of an absolute geometry over a field of one element and an algebraic analogue of Arakelov's geometry were realized in this setup.\nAnother formal generalization is possible to universal algebraic geometry in which every variety of algebras has its own algebraic geometry. The term variety of algebras should not be confused with algebraic variety.\nThe language of schemes, stacks and generalizations has proved to be a valuable way of dealing with geometric concepts and became cornerstones of modern algebraic geometry.\nAlgebraic stacks can be further generalized and for many practical questions like deformation theory and intersection theory, this is often the most natural approach. One can extend the Grothendieck site of affine schemes to a higher categorical site of derived affine schemes, by replacing the commutative rings with an infinity category of differential graded commutative algebras, or of simplicial commutative rings or a similar category with an appropriate variant of a Grothendieck topology. One can also replace presheaves of sets by presheaves of simplicial sets (or of infinity groupoids). Then, in presence of an appropriate homotopic machinery one can develop a notion of derived stack as such a presheaf on the infinity category of derived affine schemes, which is satisfying certain infinite categorical version of a sheaf axiom (and to be algebraic, inductively a sequence of representability conditions). Quillen model categories, Segal categories and quasicategories are some of the most often used tools to formalize this yielding the derived algebraic geometry, introduced by the school of Carlos Simpson, including Andre Hirschowitz, Bertrand To\u00ebn, Gabrielle Vezzosi, Michel Vaqui\u00e9 and others; and developed further by Jacob Lurie, Bertrand To\u00ebn, and Gabrielle Vezzosi. Another (noncommutative) version of derived algebraic geometry, using A-infinity categories has been developed from the early 1990s by Maxim Kontsevich and followers.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Before the 16th century ===\nSome of the roots of algebraic geometry date back to the work of the Hellenistic Greeks from the 5th century BC. The Delian problem, for instance, was to construct a length x so that the cube of side x contained the same volume as the rectangular box a2b for given sides a and b. Menaechmus (circa 350 BC) considered the problem geometrically by intersecting the pair of plane conics ay = x2 and xy = ab. In the 3rd century BC, Archimedes and Apollonius systematically studied additional problems on conic sections using coordinates. Medieval Muslim mathematicians, including Ibn al-Haytham in the 10th century AD, solved certain cubic equations by purely algebraic means and then interpreted the results geometrically. The Persian mathematician Omar Khayy\u00e1m (born 1048 AD) discovered a method for solving cubic equations by intersecting a parabola with a circle and seems to have been the first to conceive a general theory of cubic equations. A few years after Omar Khayy\u00e1m, Sharaf al-Din al-Tusi's Treatise on equations has been described by Roshdi Rashed as \"inaugurating the beginning of algebraic geometry\". This was criticized by Jeffrey Oaks, who claims that the study of curves by means of equations originated with Descartes in the seventeenth century.\n\n\n=== Renaissance ===\nSuch techniques of applying geometrical constructions to algebraic problems were also adopted by a number of Renaissance mathematicians such as Gerolamo Cardano and Niccol\u00f2 Fontana \"Tartaglia\" on their studies of the cubic equation. The geometrical approach to construction problems, rather than the algebraic one, was favored by most 16th and 17th century mathematicians, notably Blaise Pascal who argued against the use of algebraic and analytical methods in geometry. The French mathematicians Franciscus Vieta and later Ren\u00e9 Descartes and Pierre de Fermat revolutionized the conventional way of thinking about construction problems through the introduction of coordinate geometry. They were interested primarily in the properties of algebraic curves, such as those defined by Diophantine equations (in the case of Fermat), and the algebraic reformulation of the classical Greek works on conics and cubics (in the case of Descartes).\nDuring the same period, Blaise Pascal and G\u00e9rard Desargues approached geometry from a different perspective, developing the synthetic notions of projective geometry. Pascal and Desargues also studied curves, but from the purely geometrical point of view: the analog of the Greek ruler and compass construction. Ultimately, the analytic geometry of Descartes and Fermat won out, for it supplied the 18th century mathematicians with concrete quantitative tools needed to study physical problems using the new calculus of Newton and Leibniz. However, by the end of the 18th century, most of the algebraic character of coordinate geometry was subsumed by the calculus of infinitesimals of Lagrange and Euler.\n\n\n=== 19th and early 20th century ===\nIt took the simultaneous 19th century developments of non-Euclidean geometry and Abelian integrals in order to bring the old algebraic ideas back into the geometrical fold. The first of these new developments was seized up by Edmond Laguerre and Arthur Cayley, who attempted to ascertain the generalized metric properties of projective space. Cayley introduced the idea of homogeneous polynomial forms, and more specifically quadratic forms, on projective space. Subsequently, Felix Klein studied projective geometry (along with other types of geometry) from the viewpoint that the geometry on a space is encoded in a certain class of transformations on the space. By the end of the 19th century, projective geometers were studying more general kinds of transformations on figures in projective space. Rather than the projective linear transformations which were normally regarded as giving the fundamental Kleinian geometry on projective space, they concerned themselves also with the higher degree birational transformations. This weaker notion of congruence would later lead members of the 20th century Italian school of algebraic geometry to classify algebraic surfaces up to birational isomorphism.\nThe second early 19th century development, that of Abelian integrals, would lead Bernhard Riemann to the development of Riemann surfaces.\nIn the same period began the algebraization of the algebraic geometry through commutative algebra. The prominent results in this direction are Hilbert's basis theorem and Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, which are the basis of the connexion between algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, and Macaulay's multivariate resultant, which is the basis of elimination theory. Probably because of the size of the computation which is implied by multivariate resultants, elimination theory was forgotten during the middle of the 20th century until it was renewed by singularity theory and computational algebraic geometry.\n\n\n=== 20th century ===\nB. L. van der Waerden, Oscar Zariski and Andr\u00e9 Weil developed a foundation for algebraic geometry based on contemporary commutative algebra, including valuation theory and the theory of ideals. One of the goals was to give a rigorous framework for proving the results of Italian school of algebraic geometry. In particular, this school used systematically the notion of generic point without any precise definition, which was first given by these authors during the 1930s.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Jean-Pierre Serre and Alexander Grothendieck recast the foundations making use of sheaf theory. Later, from about 1960, and largely led by Grothendieck, the idea of schemes was worked out, in conjunction with a very refined apparatus of homological techniques. After a decade of rapid development the field stabilized in the 1970s, and new applications were made, both to number theory and to more classical geometric questions on algebraic varieties, singularities, moduli, and formal moduli.\nAn important class of varieties, not easily understood directly from their defining equations, are the abelian varieties, which are the projective varieties whose points form an abelian group. The prototypical examples are the elliptic curves, which have a rich theory. They were instrumental in the proof of Fermat's last theorem and are also used in elliptic-curve cryptography.\nIn parallel with the abstract trend of the algebraic geometry, which is concerned with general statements about varieties, methods for effective computation with concretely-given varieties have also been developed, which lead to the new area of computational algebraic geometry. One of the founding methods of this area is the theory of Gr\u00f6bner bases, introduced by Bruno Buchberger in 1965. Another founding method, more specially devoted to real algebraic geometry, is the cylindrical algebraic decomposition, introduced by George E. Collins in 1973.\nSee also: derived algebraic geometry.\n\n\n== Analytic geometry ==\nAn analytic variety is defined locally as the set of common solutions of several equations involving analytic functions. It is analogous to the included concept of real or complex algebraic variety. Any complex manifold is an analytic variety. Since analytic varieties may have singular points, not all analytic varieties are manifolds.\nModern analytic geometry is essentially equivalent to real and complex algebraic geometry, as has been shown by Jean-Pierre Serre in his paper GAGA, the name of which is French for Algebraic geometry and analytic geometry. Nevertheless, the two fields remain distinct, as the methods of proof are quite different and algebraic geometry includes also geometry in finite characteristic.\n\n\n== Applications ==\nAlgebraic geometry now finds applications in statistics, control theory, robotics, error-correcting codes, phylogenetics and geometric modelling. There are also connections to string theory, game theory, graph matchings, solitons and integer programming.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nKline, M.

Examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are: plane algebraic curves, which include lines, circles, parabolas, ellipses, hyperbolas, cubic curves like elliptic curves, and quartic curves like lemniscates and Cassini ovals. A point of the plane belongs to an algebraic curve if its coordinates satisfy a given polynomial equation. Basic questions involve the study of the points of special interest like the singular points, the inflection points and the points at infinity. More advanced questions involve the topology of the curve and relations between the curves given by different equations.\nAlgebraic geometry occupies a central place in modern mathematics and has multiple conceptual connections with such diverse fields as complex analysis, topology and number theory. Initially a study of systems of polynomial equations in several variables, the subject of algebraic geometry starts where equation solving leaves off, and it becomes even more important to understand the intrinsic properties of the totality of solutions of a system of equations, than to find a specific solution; this leads into some of the deepest areas in all of mathematics, both conceptually and in terms of technique.\nIn the 20th century, algebraic geometry split into several subareas.\n\nThe mainstream of algebraic geometry is devoted to the study of the complex points of the algebraic varieties and more generally to the points with coordinates in an algebraically closed field.\nReal algebraic geometry is the study of the real points of an algebraic variety.\nDiophantine geometry and, more generally, arithmetic geometry is the study of the points of an algebraic variety with coordinates in fields that are not algebraically closed and occur in algebraic number theory, such as the field of rational numbers, number fields, finite fields, function fields, and p-adic fields.\nA large part of singularity theory is devoted to the singularities of algebraic varieties.\nComputational algebraic geometry is an area that has emerged at the intersection of algebraic geometry and computer algebra, with the rise of computers. It consists mainly of algorithm design and software development for the study of properties of explicitly given algebraic varieties.Much of the development of the mainstream of algebraic geometry in the 20th century occurred within an abstract algebraic framework, with increasing emphasis being placed on \"intrinsic\" properties of algebraic varieties not dependent on any particular way of embedding the variety in an ambient coordinate space; this parallels developments in topology, differential and complex geometry. One key achievement of this abstract algebraic geometry is Grothendieck's scheme theory which allows one to use sheaf theory to study algebraic varieties in a way which is very similar to its use in the study of differential and analytic manifolds. This is obtained by extending the notion of point: In classical algebraic geometry, a point of an affine variety may be identified, through Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, with a maximal ideal of the coordinate ring, while the points of the corresponding affine scheme are all prime ideals of this ring. This means that a point of such a scheme may be either a usual point or a subvariety. This approach also enables a unification of the language and the tools of classical algebraic geometry, mainly concerned with complex points, and of algebraic number theory. Wiles' proof of the longstanding conjecture called Fermat's last theorem is an example of the power of this approach."}, "Econometrica": {"links": ["Frisch Medal", "Hdl ", "Journal of the Royal Statistical Society", "Edward C.

The article also discusses journals in the same field.\n\n\n== Psychometrics ==\n\nPsychometrics deals with measurement of psychological attributes. It involves developing and applying statistical models for mental measurements. The measurement theories are divided into two major areas: (1) Classical test theory; (2) Item Response Theory.\n\n\n=== Classical Test Theory ===\n\nThe classical test theory or true score theory or reliability theory in statistics is a set of statistical procedures useful for development of psychological tests and scales. It is based on a fundamental equation, \nX = T + E\nwhere, X is total score, T is a true score and E is error of measurement. For each participant, it assumes that there exist a true score and it need to be obtained score (X) has to be as close to it as possible. The closeness of X has with T is expressed in terms of ratability of the obtained score. The reliability in terms of classical test procedure is correlation between true score and obtained score. The typical test construction procedures has following steps:\n(1)\tDetermine the construct \n(2)\tOutline the behavioral domain of the construct\n(3)\tWrite 3 to 5 times more items than desired test length\n(4)\tGet item content analyzed by experts and cull items\n(5)\tObtain data on initial version of the test \n(6)\tItem analysis (Statistical Procedure)\n(7)\tFactor analysis (Statistical Procedure)\n(8)\tAfter the second cull, make final version\n(9)\tUse it for research\n\n\n==== Reliability ====\n\nThe reliability is computed in specific ways.  \n(A)\tInter-Rater reliability: Inter-Rater reliability is estimate of agreement between independent raters. This is most useful for subjective responses. Cohen's Kappa, Krippendorff's Alpha, Intra-Class correlation coefficients, Correlation coefficients, Kendal's concordance coefficient, etc. are useful statistical tools. \n(B)\tTest-Retest Reliability: Test-Retest Procedure is estimation of temporal consistency of the test. A test is administered twice to the same sample with a time interval. Correlation between two sets of scores is used as an estimate of reliability. Testing conditions are assumed to be identical. \n(C)\t Internal Consistency Reliability: Internal consistency reliability estimates consistency of items with each other. Split-half reliability (Spearman- Brown Prophecy) and Cronbach Alpha are popular estimates of this reliability. \n(D)\tParallel Form Reliability: It is an estimate of consistency between two different instruments of measurement. The inter-correlation between two parallel forms of a test or scale is used as an estimate of parallel form reliability.\n\n\n==== Validity ====\n\nValidity of a scale or test is ability of the instrument to measure what it purports to measure. Construct validity, Content Validity, and Criterion Validity are types of validity. \nConstruct validity is estimated by convergent and discriminant validity and factor analysis. Convergent and discriminant validity are ascertained by correlation between similar of different constructs. \nContent Validity: Subject matter experts evaluate content validity. \nCriterion Validity is correlation between the test and a criterion variable (or variables) of the construct. Regression analysis, Multiple regression analysis, and Logistic regression are used as an estimate of criterion validity. \nSoftware applications: The R software has \u2018psych\u2019 package that is useful for classical test theory analysis.\n\n\n=== Modern test Theory ===\n\nThe modern test theory is based on latent trait model. Every item estimates the ability of the test taker. The ability parameter is called as theta (\u03b8). The difficulty parameter is called b. the two important assumptions are local independence and unidimensionality.   \nThe Item Response Theory has three models. They are one parameter logistic model, two parameter logistic model and three parameter logistic model. In addition, Polychromous IRT Model are also useful.The R Software has \u2018ltm\u2019, packages useful for IRT analysis.\n\n\n== Factor Analysis ==\n\nFactor analysis is at the core of psychological statistics. It has two schools: (1) Exploratory Factor analysis (2) Confirmatory Factor analysis.\n\n\n=== Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) ===\n\nThe exploratory factor analysis begins without a theory or with a very tentative theory. It is a dimension reduction technique. It is useful in psychometrics, multivariate analysis of data and data analytics. \nTypically a k-dimensional correlation matrix or covariance matrix of variables is reduced to k X r factor pattern matrix where r < k. Principal Component analysis and common factor analysis are two ways of extracting data. Principal axis factoring, ML factor analysis, alpha factor analysis and image factor analysis is most useful ways of EFA. \nIt employs various factor rotation methods which can be classified into orthogonal (resulting in uncorrelated factors) and oblique (resulting correlated factors).\nThe \u2018psych\u2019 package in R is useful for EFA.\n\n\n=== Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) ===\n\nConfirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) is factor analytic technique that begins with theory and test the theory by carrying out factor analysis. \nThe CFA is also called as latent structure analysis, which considers factor as latent variables causing actual observable variables. The basic equation of the CFA is\nX = \u039b\u03be + \u03b4\nwhere, X is observed variables, \u039b are structural coefficients, \u03be are latent variables (factors) and \u03b4 are errors. \nThe parameters are estimated using ML methods however; other methods of estimation are also available. The chi-square test is very sensitive and hence various fit measures are used.\nR package \u2018sem\u2019, \u2018lavaan\u2019 are useful for the same.\n\n\n== Experimental Design ==\n\nExperimental Methods are very popular in psychology. It has more than 100 years tradition. Experimental psychology has a status of sub-discipline in psychology .\nThe statistical methods are applied for designing and analyzing experimental data. They involve, t-test, ANOVA, ANCOVA,  MANOVA, MANCOVA, binomial test, chi-square etc. are used for the analysis of the experimental data.\n\n\n== Multivariate Behavioral Research ==\nMultivariate behavioral research is becoming very popular in psychology. These methods include Multiple Regression and Prediction; Moderated and Mediated Regression Analysis; Logistics Regression; Canonical Correlations; Cluster analysis; Multi-level modeling; Survival-Failure analysis; Structural Equations Modeling; hierarchical linear modelling, etc. are very useful for psychological statistics.\n\n\n== Journals for statistical application for psychology ==\nThere are many specialized journals that publish advances in statistical analysis for psychology:\n\nPsychometrika\nEducational and Psychological Measurement\nAssessment\nAmerican Journal of Evaluation\nApplied Psychological Measurement\nBehavior Research Methods\nBritish Journal of Mathematical and Statistical Psychology\nJournal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics\nJournal of Mathematical Psychology\nMultivariate Behavioral Research\nPsychological Assessment\nStructural Equation Modeling\n\n\n== Software Packages for Psychological Research ==\nVarious software packages are available for statistical methods for psychological research. They can be classified as commercial software (e.g., JMP and SPSS) and open-source (e.g., R). Among the open-source offerings, the R software is the most popular. There are many online references for R and specialized books on R for Psychologists are also being written. The \"psych\" package of R is very useful for psychologists. Among others, \"lavaan\", \"sem\", \"ltm\", \"ggplot2\" are some of the popular packages. PSPP and KNIME are other free packages. Among the commercial packages include JMP, SPSS and SAS. JMP and SPSS are commonly reported in books.\n\n\n== See also ==\nQuantitative psychology\n\n\n== References ==\nAgresti, A. (1990). Categorical data analysis. Wiley: NJ.\nBollen, KA. (1989).

Industrial, work and organizational psychology (IWO) is the broader global term for the field internationally.\nThe discipline is the science of human behavior relating to work and applies psychological theories and principles to organizations and individuals in their places of work as well as the individual's work-life more generally. Industrial and organizational psychologists are trained in the scientist\u2013practitioner model. They contribute to an organization's success by improving the performance, motivation, job satisfaction, and occupational safety and health as well as the overall health and well-being of its employees. An I-O psychologist conducts research on employee behaviors and attitudes, and how these can be improved through hiring practices, training programs, feedback, and management systems.I-O psychology was ranked the fastest growing occupation over the next decade according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics's Occupational Outlook Handbook in 2014. It is estimated to grow 53% with a mean salary of US$109,030, with those at the top 10 percentile earning $192,150 for 2018.As of 2020, I-O psychology is one of the 17 recognized professional specialties by the American Psychological Association (APA) in the United States. It is represented by Division 14 of the APA and is formally known as the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP).\n\n\n== International ==\nIn the United Kingdom, industrial and organizational psychologists are referred to as occupational psychologists. Occupational psychology in the UK is one of nine \"protected titles\" within the profession \"practitioner psychologist\" regulated by the Health and Care Professions Council. In the UK, graduate programs in psychology, including occupational psychology, are accredited by the British Psychological Society.\nIn Australia, the title organizational psychologist is protected by law, and regulated by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA). Organizational psychology is one of nine areas of specialist endorsement for psychology practice in Australia.In Europe, someone with a specialist EuroPsy Certificate in Work and Organisational Psychology is a fully qualified psychologist and a specialist in the work psychology field. Industrial and organizational psychologists reaching the EuroPsy standard are recorded in the Register of European Psychologists and industrial and organizational psychology is one of the three main psychology specializations in Europe.\nIn South Africa, industrial psychology is a registration category for the profession of psychologist as regulated by the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA).\n\n\n== Historical overview ==\nThe historical development of I-O psychology was paralleled in the US, the UK, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, and Eastern European countries such as Romania. The roots of I-O psychology trace back nearly to the beginning of psychology as a science, when Wilhelm Wundt founded one of the first psychological laboratories in 1879 in Leipzig, Germany. In the mid 1880s, Wundt trained two psychologists, Hugo M\u00fcnsterberg and James McKeen Cattell, who had a major influence on the emergence of I-O psychology.Instead of viewing performance differences as human \"errors\", Cattell was one of the first to recognize the importance of differences among individuals as a way of better understanding work behavior. Walter Dill Scott, who was a contemporary of Cattell, was elected President of the American Psychological Association (APA) in 1919, was arguably the most prominent I-O psychologist of his time. Scott, along with Walter Van Dyke Bingham, worked at the Carnegie Institute of Technology, developing methods for selecting and training sales personnel.The \"industrial\" side of I-O psychology originated in research on individual differences, assessment, and the prediction of work performance. Industrial psychology crystallized during World War I. In response to the need to rapidly assign new troops to duty. Scott and Bingham volunteered to help with the testing and placement of more than a million army recruits. In 1917, together with other prominent psychologists, they adapted a well-known intelligence test the Stanford\u2013Binet, which was designed for testing one individual at a time, to make it suitable for group testing. The new test was called the Army Alpha.After the war, the growing industrial base in the US was a source of momentum for what was then called industrial psychology. Private industry set out to emulate the successful testing of army personnel. Mental ability testing soon became commonplace in the work setting.\nElton Mayo found that rest periods improved morale and reduced turnover in a Philadelphia textile factory. He later joined the ongoing Hawthorne studies, where he became interested in how workers' emotions and informal relationships affected productivity. The results of these studies ushered in the human relations movement.World War II brought renewed interest in ability testing (to accurately place recruits in new technologically advanced military jobs), the introduction of the assessment center, and concern with morale and fatigue in war industry workers.The industrial psychology division of the former American Association of Applied Psychology became a division within APA, becoming Division 14 of APA. It was initially called the Industrial and Business Psychology Division. In 1962, the name was changed to the Industrial Psychology Division. In 1973, it was renamed again, this time to the Division of Industrial and Organizational Psychology. In 1982, the unit become more independent of APA, and its name was changed again, this time to the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology.The name change of the division from \"industrial psychology\" to \"industrial and organizational psychology\" reflected the shift in the work of industrial psychologists who had originally addressed work behavior from the individual perspective, examining performance and attitudes of individual workers. Their work became broader. Group behavior in the workplace became a worthy subject of study. The emphasis on \"organizational\" underlined the fact that when an individual joins an organization (e.g., the organization that hired him or her), he or she will be exposed to a common goal and a common set of operating procedures. In the 1970s in the UK, references to occupational psychology became more common than I-O psychology.According to Bryan and Vinchur, \"while organizational psychology increased in popularity through [the 1960s and 1970s], research and practice in the traditional areas of industrial psychology continued, primarily driven by employment legislation and case law\". There was a focus on fairness and validity in selection efforts as well as in the job analyses that undergirded selection instruments. For example, I-O psychology showed increased interest in behaviorally anchored rating scales. What critics there were of I-O psychology accused the discipline of being responsive only to the concerns of managements.From the 1980s to 2010s, other changes in I-O psychology took place. Researchers increasingly adopted a multi-level approach, attempting to understand behavioral phenomena from both the level of the organization and the level of the individual worker. There was also an increased interest in the needs and expectations of employees as individuals. For example, an emphasis on organizational justice and the psychological contract took root, as well as the more traditional concerns of selection and training. Methodological innovations (e.g., meta-analyses, structural equation modeling) were adopted. With the passage of the American with Disabilities Act in 1990 and parallel legislation elsewhere in the world, I-O psychology saw an increased emphasis on \"fairness in personnel decisions.\" Training research relied increasingly on advances in educational psychology and cognitive science.\n\n\n== Research methods ==\nAs described above, I-O psychologists are trained in the scientist\u2013practitioner model. I-O psychologists rely on a variety of methods to conduct organizational research. Study designs employed by I-O psychologists include surveys, experiments, quasi-experiments, and observational studies. I-O psychologists rely on diverse data sources including human judgments, historical databases, objective measures of work performance (e.g., sales volume), and questionnaires and surveys.\nI-O researchers employ quantitative statistical methods. Quantitative methods used in I-O psychology include correlation, multiple regression, and analysis of variance. More advanced statistical methods employed in I-O research include logistic regression, structural equation modeling, and hierarchical linear modeling (HLM; also known as multilevel modeling). I-O research has also employed meta-analysis. I-O psychologists also employ psychometric methods including methods associated with classical test theory, generalizability theory, and item response theory (IRT).I-O psychologists have also employed qualitative methods, which largely involve focus groups, interviews, and case studies. I-O psychologists conducting research on organizational culture have employed ethnographic techniques and participant observation. A qualitative technique associated with I-O psychology is Flanagan's Critical Incident Technique. I-O psychologists also use quantitative and qualitative methods in concert and  sometimes within a single study.\n\n\n== Topics ==\n\n\n=== Job analysis ===\n\nJob analysis encompasses a number of different methods including, but not limited to, interviews, questionnaires, task analysis, and observation. It primarily involves the systematic collection of information about a job. A task-oriented job analysis involves an examination of the duties, tasks, and/or competencies required by the job being assessed. By contrast, a worker-oriented job analysis involves an examination of the knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics (KSAOs) required to successfully perform the work. Information obtained from job analyses are used for many purposes, including the creation of job-relevant selection procedures, performance appraisals and the criteria they require, and the development of training programs.\n\n\n=== Personnel recruitment and selection ===\n\nI-O psychologists typically work with human resource specialists to design (a) recruitment processes and (b) personnel selection systems. Personnel recruitment is the process of identifying qualified candidates in the workforce and getting them to apply for jobs within an organization. Personnel recruitment processes include developing job announcements, placing ads, defining key qualifications for applicants, and screening out unqualified applicants.\nPersonnel selection is the systematic process of hiring and promoting personnel. Personnel selection systems employ evidence-based practices to determine the most qualified candidates. Personnel selection involves both the newly hired and individuals who can be promoted from within the organization. Common selection tools include ability tests (e.g., cognitive, physical, or psycho-motor), knowledge tests, personality tests, structured interviews, the systematic collection of biographical data, and work samples. I-O psychologists must evaluate evidence regarding the extent to which selection tools predict job performance.\nPersonnel selection procedures are usually validated, i.e., shown to be job relevant to personnel selection, using one or more of the following types of validity: content validity, construct validity, and/or criterion-related validity. I-O psychologists must adhere to professional standards in personnel selection efforts. SIOP (e.g., Principles for validation and use of personnel selection procedures) and APA together with the National Council on Measurement in Education (e.g., Standards for educational and psychological testing are sources of those standards. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's Uniform guidelines are also influential in guiding personnel selection decisions.\nA meta-analysis of selection methods found that general mental ability was the best overall predictor of job performance and attainment in training.\n\n\n=== Performance appraisal/management ===\n\nPerformance appraisal or performance evaluation is the process in which an individual's or a group's work behaviors and outcomes are assessed against managers' and others' expectations for the job. Performance appraisal is frequently used in promotion and compensation decisions, to help design and validate personnel selection procedures, and for performance management. Performance management is the process of providing performance feedback relative to expectations, and information relevant to improvement (e.g., coaching, mentoring). Performance management may also include documenting and tracking performance information for organizational evaluation purposes.\nAn I-O psychologist would typically use information from the job analysis to determine a job's performance dimensions, and then construct a rating scale to describe each level of performance for the job. Often, the I-O psychologist would be responsible for training organizational personnel how to use the performance appraisal instrument, including ways to minimize bias when using the rating scale, and how to provide effective performance feedback.\n\n\n=== Individual assessment and psychometrics ===\n\nIndividual assessment involves the measurement of individual differences. I-O psychologists perform individual assessments in order to evaluate differences among candidates for employment as well as differences among employees. The constructs measured pertain to job performance. With candidates for employment, individual assessment is often part of the personnel selection process. These assessments can include written tests, aptitude tests, physical tests, psycho-motor tests, personality tests, integrity and reliability tests, work samples, simulations, and assessment centres.\n\n\n=== Occupational health and well-being ===\nI-O psychologists are concerned with occupational health and well-being for well over a century. Developments early in the 20th century occurred in both the UK and the U.S. During World War I Charles Myers in the U.K. studied worker fatigue and other aspects of well-being, discussed in his 1920 I-O psychology textbook. In the U.S. Arthur Kornhauser examined the impact on productivity of hiring mentally unstable workers. Kornhauser also examined the link between industrial working conditions and mental health as well as the spillover into a worker's personal life of having an unsatisfying job.More recently, I-O researchers have found that staying vigorous during working hours is associated with better work-related behaviour and subjective well-being as well as more effective functioning in the family domain. Trait vigor and recovery experiences after work were related to vigor at work. Job satisfaction has also been found to be associated with life satisfaction, happiness, well-being and positive affect, and the absence of negative affect.  Other research indicates that among older workers activities such as volunteering and participating in social clubs was related to a decrease in depressive symptoms over the next two years. Research on job changing indicates that mobility between, but not within, organizations is associated with burnout. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a new discipline, occupational health psychology, emerged from i/o psychology and both health psychology, and occupational medicine.\n\n\n=== Work design ===\n\nWork design concerns the \"content and organisational of one's work tasks, activities, relationships, and responsibilities.\" Research has demonstrated that work design has important implications for individual employees (e.g., level of engagement, job strain, chance of injury), teams (e.g., how effectively teams co-ordinate their activities), organisations (e.g., productivity, safety, efficiency targets), and society (e.g., whether a nation utilises the skills of its population or promotes effective aging).I-O psychologists review job tasks, relationships, and an individual's way of thinking about their work to ensure that their roles are meaningful and motivating, thus creating greater productivity and job satisfaction. Deliberate interventions aimed at altering work design are sometimes referred to as work redesign. Such interventions can be initiated by the management of an organization (e.g., job rotation, job enlargement, job enrichment) or by individual workers (e.g., job crafting, role innovation, idiosyncratic ideals).\n\n\n=== Workplace bullying, aggression and violence ===\n \nI-O psychologists are concerned with the related topics of workplace bullying, aggression, and violence. For example, I-O research found that exposure to workplace violence elicited ruminative thinking.  Ruminative thinking is associated with poor well-being. I-O research has found that interpersonal aggressive behaviour is associated with worse team performance.\n\n\n=== Remuneration and compensation ===\n\nCompensation includes wages or salary, bonuses, pension/retirement contributions, and employee benefits that can be converted to cash or replace living expenses. I-O psychologists may be asked to conduct a job evaluation for the purpose of determining compensation levels and ranges. I-O psychologists may also serve as expert witnesses in pay discrimination cases, when disparities in pay for similar work are alleged by employees.\n\n\n==== Training and training evaluation ====\n\nTraining involves the systematic teaching of skills, concepts, or attitudes that results in improved performance in another environment. Because many people hired for a job are not already versed in all the tasks the job requires, training may be needed to help the individual perform the job effectively. Evidence indicates that training is often effective, and that it succeeds in terms of higher net sales and gross profitability per employee.Similar to performance management (see above), an I-O psychologist would employ a job analysis in concert with the application of the principles of instructional design to create an effective training program. A training program is likely to include a summative evaluation at its conclusion in order to ensure that trainees have met the training objectives and can perform the target work tasks at an acceptable level. Training programs often include formative evaluations to assess the effect of the training as the training proceeds. Formative evaluations can be used to locate problems in training procedures and help I-O psychologists make corrective adjustments while training is ongoing.The foundation for training programs is learning. Learning outcomes can be organized into three broad categories: cognitive, skill-based, and affective outcomes. Cognitive training is aimed at instilling declarative knowledge or the knowledge of rules, facts, and principles (e.g., police officer training covers laws and court procedures). Skill-based training aims to impart procedural knowledge (e.g., skills needed to use a special tool) or technical skills (e.g., understanding the workings of software program). Affective training concerns teaching individuals to develop specific attitudes or beliefs that predispose trainees to behave a certain way (e.g., show commitment to the organization, appreciate diversity).A needs assessment, an analysis of corporate and individual goals, is often undertaken prior to the development of a training program. In addition, a careful needs analysis is required in order to develop a systematic understanding of where training is needed, what should be taught, and who will be trained. A training needs analysis typically involves a three-step process that includes organizational analysis, task analysis and person analysis.An organizational analysis is an examination of organizational goals and resources as well as the organizational environment. The results of an organizational analysis help to determine where training should be directed. The analysis identifies the training needs of different departments or subunits. It systematically assesses manager, peer, and technological support for transfer of training. An organizational analysis also takes into account the climate of the organization and its subunits. For example, if a climate for safety is emphasized throughout the organization or in subunits of the organization (e.g., production), then training needs will likely reflect an emphasis on safety. A task analysis uses the results of a job analysis to determine what is needed for successful job performance, contributing to training content. With organizations increasingly trying to identify \"core competencies\" that are required for all jobs, task analysis can also include an assessment of competencies. A person analysis identifies which individuals within an organization should receive training and what kind of instruction they need. Employee needs can be assessed using a variety of methods that identify weaknesses that training can address.\n\n\n=== Motivation in the workplace ===\n\nWork motivation reflects the energy an individual applies \"to initiate work-related behavior, and to determine its form, direction, intensity, and duration\" Understanding what motivates an organization's employees is central to I-O psychology. Motivation is generally thought of as a theoretical construct that fuels behavior. An incentive is an anticipated reward that is thought to incline a person to behave a certain way. Motivation varies among individuals. Studying its influence on behavior, it must be examined together with ability and environmental influences. Because of motivation's role in influencing workplace behavior and performance, many organizations structure the work environment to encourage productive behaviors and discourage unproductive behaviors.Motivation involves three psychological processes: arousal, direction, and intensity. Arousal is what initiates action. It is often fueled by a person's need or desire for something that is missing from his or her life, either totally or partially. Direction refers to the path employees take in accomplishing the goals they set for themselves. Intensity is the amount of energy employees put into goal-directed work performance. The level of intensity often reflects the importance and difficulty of the goal. These psychological processes involve four factors.  First, motivation serves to direct attention, focusing on particular issues, people, tasks, etc. Second, it serves to stimulate effort. Third, motivation influences persistence. Finally, motivation influences the choice and application of task-related strategies.\n\n\n=== Occupational stress ===\n\nI-O psychologists have since the 1960s been at the forefront of research and the practice of occupational stress and design of individual and organizational interventions to manage and reduce the stress levels and increase productivity, performance, health and wellbeing. Occupational stress can have implications for organizational performance because of the emotions job stress evokes. For example, a job stressor such as conflict with a supervisor can precipitate anger that in turn motivates counterproductive workplace behaviors. I-O research has examined the association between work stressors and aggression, theft, substance abuse, and depressive symptoms. A number of models have been developed to explain the job stress process, including the person-environment (P-E) fit model and the demand-control model.I-O research has also examined occupational stress in specific occupations, including police, general practitioners, and dentists. Another concern has been the relation of occupational stress to family life. Other I-O researchers have examined gender differences in leadership style and job stress and strain in the context of male- and female-dominated industries, and unemployment-related distress. I-O psychology is also concerned with the relation of occupational stress to career advancement.\n\n\n=== Occupational safety ===\n\nAccidents and safety in the workplace are significant areas of interest to I-O psychology and I-O psychologists. Examples of psychosocial injury hazards of interest to I-O psychology include fatigue, workplace violence, workplace bullying, and working night shifts. I-O researchers conduct \"stress audits\" that can help organizations remain compliant with various occupational safety regulations. Psychosocial hazards can affect musculoskeletal disorders. A psychosocial factor related to accident risk is safety climate, which refers to employees' perceptions of the extent to which their work organization prioritizes safety. By contrast, psychosocial safety climate refers to management's \"policies, practices, and procedures\" aimed at protecting workers' psychological health. Research on safety leadership is also relevant to I-O psychology. Research suggests that safety-oriented transformational leadership is associated with a positive safety climate and safe worker practices.\n\n\n=== Organizational culture ===\n\nWhile there is no universal definition for organizational culture, a collective understanding shares the following assumptions:\n... that they are related to history and tradition, have some depth, are difficult to grasp and account for, and must be interpreted; that they are collective and shared by members of groups and primarily ideational in character, having to do with values, understandings, beliefs, knowledge, and other intangibles; and that they are holistic and subjective rather than strictly rational and analytical.\nOrganizational culture has been shown to affect important organizational outcomes such as performance, attraction, recruitment, retention, employee satisfaction, and employee well-being. There are three levels of organizational culture: artifacts, shared values, and basic beliefs and assumptions. Artifacts comprise the physical components of the organization that relay cultural meaning. Shared values are individuals' preferences regarding certain aspects of the organization's culture (e.g., loyalty, customer service). Basic beliefs and assumptions include individuals' impressions about the trustworthiness and supportiveness of an organization, and are often deeply ingrained within the organization's culture.\nIn addition to an overall culture, organizations also have subcultures. Subcultures can be departmental (e.g. different work units) or defined by geographical distinction. While there is no single \"type\" of organizational culture, some researchers have developed models to describe different organizational cultures.\n\n\n=== Group behavior ===\n\nGroup behavior involves the interactions among individuals in a collective. The individuals' opinions, attitudes, and adaptations affect group behavior, with group behavior in turn affecting those opinions, etc. The interactions are thought to fulfill some need satisfaction in an individual who is part of the collective. A specific area of I-O research in group behavior is the team dynamics and team effectiveness.\n\n\n==== Team effectiveness ====\n\nOrganizations often organize teams because teams can accomplish a much greater amount of work in a short period of time than an individual can accomplish. I-O research has examined the harm workplace aggression does to team performance.\n\n\n==== Team composition ====\nTeam composition, or the configuration of team member knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics, fundamentally influences teamwork. Team composition can be considered in the selection and management of teams to increase the likelihood of team success. To achieve high-quality results, teams built with members having higher skill levels are more likely to be effective than teams built around members having lesser skills; teams that include a members with a diversity of skills are also likely to show improved team performance. Team members should also be compatible in terms of personality traits, values, and work styles. There is substantial evidence that personality traits and values can shape the nature of teamwork, and influence team performance.\n\n\n==== Team task design ====\nA fundamental question in team task design is whether or not a task is even appropriate for a team. Those tasks that require predominantly independent work are best left to individuals, and team tasks should include those tasks that consist primarily of interdependent work. When a given task is appropriate for a team, task design can play a key role in team effectiveness.Job characteristic theory identifies core job dimensions that affect motivation, satisfaction, performance, etc. These dimensions include skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy and feedback. The dimensions map well to the team environment. Individual contributors who perform team tasks that are challenging, interesting, and engaging are more likely to be motivated to exert greater effort and perform better than team members who are working on tasks that lack those characteristics.\n\n\n==== Organizational resources ====\nOrganizational support systems affect the team effectiveness and provide resources for teams operating in the multi-team environment. During the chartering of new teams, organizational enabling resources are first identified. Examples of enabling resources include facilities, equipment, information, training, and leadership. Team-specific resources (e.g., budgetary resources, human resources) are typically made available. Team-specific human resources represent the individual contributors who are selected to be team members. Intra-team processes (e.g., task design, task assignment) involve these team-specific resources.Teams also function in dynamic multi-team environments. Teams often must respond to shifting organizational contingencies. Contingencies affecting teams include constraints arising from conditions in which organizational resources are not exclusively earmarked for certain teams. When resources are scarce, they must be shared by multiple teams.\n\n\n==== Team rewards ====\nOrganizational reward systems drive the strengthening and enhancing of individual team member efforts; such efforts contribute towards reaching team goals. In other words, rewards that are given to individual team members should be contingent upon the performance of the entire team.Several design elements are needed to enable organizational reward systems to operate successfully. First, for a collective assessment to be appropriate for individual team members, the group's tasks must be highly interdependent. If this is not the case, individual assessment is more appropriate than team assessment. Second, individual-level reward systems and team-level reward systems must be compatible. For example, it would be unfair to reward the entire team for a job well done if only one team member did most of the work. That team member would most likely view teams and teamwork negatively, and would not want to work on a team in the future. Third, an organizational culture must be created such that it supports and rewards employees who believe in the value of teamwork and who maintain a positive attitude towards team-based rewards.\n\n\n==== Team goals ====\nGoals potentially motivate team members when goals contain three elements: difficulty, acceptance, and specificity. Under difficult goal conditions, teams with more committed members tend to outperform teams with less committed members. When team members commit to team goals, team effectiveness is a function of how supportive members are with each other. The goals of individual team members and team goals interact. Team and individual goals must be coordinated. Individual goals must be consistent with team goals in order for a team to be effective.\n\n\n=== Job satisfaction and commitment ===\n\nJob satisfaction is often thought to reflect the extent to which a worker likes his or her job, or individual aspects or facets of jobs. It is one of the most heavily researched topics in I-O psychology. Job satisfaction has theoretical and practical utility for the field. It has been linked to important job outcomes including attitudinal variables (e.g., job involvement, organizational commitment), absenteeism, turnover intentions, actual turnover, job performance, and tension. A meta-analyses found job satisfaction to be related to life satisfaction, happiness, positive affect, and the absence of negative affect.\n\n\n=== Productive behavior ===\nProductive behavior is defined as employee behavior that contributes positively to the goals and objectives of an organization. When an employee begins a new job, there is a transition period during which he or she may not contribute significantly. To assist with this transition an employee typically requires job-related training. In financial terms, productive behavior represents the point at which an organization begins to achieve some return on the investment it has made in a new employee. IO psychologists are ordinarily more focused on productive behavior than job or task performance, including in-role and extra-role performance. In-role performance tells managers how well an employee performs the required aspects of the job; extra-role performance includes behaviors not necessarily required by job but nonetheless contribute to organizational effectiveness. By taking both in-role and extra-role performance into account, an I-O psychologist is able to assess employees' effectiveness (how well they do what they were hired to do), efficiency (outputs to relative inputs), and productivity (how much they help the organization reach its goals). Three forms of productive behavior that IO psychologists often evaluate include job performance, organizational citizenship behavior (see below), and innovation.\n\n\n==== Job performance ====\n\nJob performance represents behaviors employees engage in while at work which contribute to organizational goals. These behaviors are formally evaluated by an organization as part of an employee's responsibilities. In order to understand and ultimately predict job performance, it is important to be precise when defining the term. Job performance is about behaviors that are within the control of the employee and not about results (effectiveness), the costs involved in achieving results (productivity), the results that can be achieved in a period of time (efficiency), or the value an organization places on a given level of performance, effectiveness, productivity or efficiency (utility).To model job performance, researchers have attempted to define a set of dimensions that are common to all jobs. Using a common set of dimensions provides a consistent basis for assessing performance and enables the comparison of performance across jobs. Performance is commonly broken into two major categories: in-role (technical aspects of a job) and extra-role (non-technical abilities such as communication skills and being a good team member). While this distinction in behavior has been challenged it is commonly made by both employees and management. A model of performance by Campbell breaks performance into in-role and extra-role categories. Campbell labeled job-specific task proficiency and non-job-specific task proficiency as in-role dimensions, while written and oral communication, demonstrating effort, maintaining personal discipline, facilitating peer and team performance, supervision and leadership and management and administration are labeled as extra-role dimensions. Murphy's model of job performance also broke job performance into in-role and extra-role categories. However, task-orientated behaviors composed the in-role category and the extra-role category included interpersonally-oriented behaviors, down-time behaviors and destructive and hazardous behaviors. However, it has been challenged as to whether the measurement of job performance is usually done through pencil/paper tests, job skills tests, on-site hands-on tests, off-site hands-on tests, high-fidelity simulations, symbolic simulations, task ratings and global ratings. These various tools are often used to evaluate performance on specific tasks and overall job performance. Van Dyne and LePine developed a measurement model in which overall job performance was evaluated using Campbell's in-role and extra-role categories. Here, in-role performance was reflected through how well \"employees met their performance expectations and performed well at the tasks that made up the employees' job.\" Dimensions regarding how well the employee assists others with their work for the benefit of the group, if the employee voices new ideas for projects or changes to procedure and whether the employee attends functions that help the group composed the extra-role category.\nTo assess job performance, reliable and valid measures must be established. While there are many sources of error with performance ratings, error can be reduced through rater training and through the use of behaviorally-anchored rating scales. Such scales can be used to clearly define the behaviors that constitute poor, average, and superior performance. Additional factors that complicate the measurement of job performance include the instability of job performance over time due to forces such as changing performance criteria, the structure of the job itself and the restriction of variation in individual performance by organizational forces. These factors include errors in job measurement techniques, acceptance and the justification of poor performance and lack of importance of individual performance.\nThe determinants of job performance consist of factors having to do with the individual worker as well as environmental factors in the workplace. According to Campbell's Model of The Determinants of Job Performance, job performance is a result of the interaction between declarative knowledge (knowledge of facts or things), procedural knowledge (knowledge of what needs to be done and how to do it), and motivation (reflective of an employee's choices regarding whether to expend effort, the level of effort to expend, and whether to persist with the level of effort chosen). The interplay between these factors show that an employee may, for example, have a low level of declarative knowledge, but may still have a high level of performance if the employee has high levels of procedural knowledge and motivation.\nRegardless of the job, three determinants stand out as predictors of performance: (1) general mental ability (especially for jobs higher in complexity); (2) job experience (although there is a law of diminishing returns); and (3) the personality trait of conscientiousness (people who are dependable and achievement-oriented, who plan well). These determinants appear to influence performance largely through the acquisition and usage of job knowledge and the motivation to do well. Further, an expanding area of research in job performance determinants includes emotional intelligence.\n\n\n=== Organizational citizenship behavior ===\n\nOrganizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) are another form of workplace behavior that IO psychologists are involved with. OCBs tend to be beneficial to both the organization and other workers. Dennis Organ (1988) defines OCBs as \"individual behavior that is discretionary, not directly or explicitly recognized by the formal reward system, and that in the aggregate promotes the effective functioning of the organization.\" Behaviors that qualify as OCBs can fall into one of the following five categories: altruism, courtesy, sportsmanship, conscientiousness, and civic virtue. OCBs have also been categorized in other ways too, for example, by their intended targets (individuals, supervisors, and the organization as a whole. Other alternative ways of categorizing OCBs include \"compulsory OCBs\", which are engaged in owing to coercive persuasion or peer pressure rather than out of good will. The extent to which OCBs are voluntary has been the subject of some debate.Other research suggests that some employees perform OCBs to influence how they are viewed within the organization. While these behaviors are not formally part of the job description, performing them can influence performance appraisals. Researchers have advanced the view that employees engage in OCBs as a form of \"impression management,\" a term coined by Erving Goffman. Goffman defined impression management as \"the way in which the individual ... presents himself and his activity to others, the ways in which he guides and controls the impression they form of him, and the kinds of things he may and may not do while sustaining his performance before them. Some researchers have hypothesized that OCBs are not performed out of good will, positive affect, etc., but instead as a way of being noticed by others, including supervisors.\n\n\n=== Innovation ===\n\nFour qualities are generally linked to creative and innovative behaviour by individuals:\nTask-relevant skills (general mental ability and job specific knowledge). Task specific and subject specific knowledge is most often gained through higher education; however, it may also be gained by mentoring and experience in a given field.\nCreativity-relevant skills (ability to concentrate on a problem for long periods of time, to abandon unproductive searches, and to temporarily put aside stubborn problems). The ability to put aside stubborn problems is referred to by Jex and Britt as productive forgetting. Creativity-relevant skills also require the individual contributor to evaluate a problem from multiple vantage points. One must be able to take on the perspective of various users. For example, an Operation Manager analyzing a reporting issue and developing an innovative solution would consider the perspective of a sales person, assistant, finance, compensation, and compliance officer.\nTask motivation (internal desire to perform task and level of enjoyment).At the organizational level, a study by Damanpour identified four specific characteristics that may predict innovation:\nA population with high levels of technical knowledge\nThe organization's level of specialization\nThe level an organization communicates externally\nFunctional differentiation.\n\n\n=== Counterproductive work behavior ===\n\nCounterproductive work behavior (CWB) can be defined as employee behavior that goes against the goals of an organization. These behaviors can be intentional or unintentional and result from a wide range of underlying causes and motivations. Some CWBs have instrumental motivations (e.g., theft). It has been proposed that a person-by-environment interaction can be utilized to explain a variety of counterproductive behaviors. For instance, an employee who sabotages another employee's work may do so because of lax supervision (environment) and underlying psychopathology (person) that work in concert to result in the counterproductive behavior. There is evidence that an emotional response (e.g., anger) to job stress (e.g., unfair treatment) can motivate CWBs.The forms of counterproductive behavior with the most empirical examination are ineffective job performance, absenteeism, job turnover, and accidents. Less common but potentially more detrimental forms of counterproductive behavior have also been investigated including violence and sexual harassment.\n\n\n=== Leadership ===\n\nIn IO psychology, leadership can be defined as a process of influencing others to agree on a shared purpose, and to work towards shared objectives. A distinction should be made between leadership and management. Managers process administrative tasks and organize work environments. Although leaders may be required to undertake managerial duties as well, leaders typically focus on inspiring followers and creating a shared organizational culture and values. Managers deal with complexity, while leaders deal with initiating and adapting to change. Managers undertake the tasks of planning, budgeting, organizing, staffing, controlling and problem solving. In contrast, leaders undertake the tasks of setting a direction or vision, aligning people to shared goals, communicating, and motivating.Approaches to studying leadership in IO psychology can be broadly classified into three categories: Leader-focused approaches, contingency-focused approaches, and follower-focused approaches.\n\n\n==== Leader-focused approaches ====\nLeader-focused approaches look to organizational leaders to determine the characteristics of effective leadership. According to the trait approach, more effective leaders possess certain traits that less effective leaders lack. More recently, this approach is being used to predict leader emergence. The following traits have been identified as those that predict leader emergence when there is no formal leader: high intelligence, high needs for dominance, high self-motivation, and socially perceptive. Another leader-focused approached is the behavioral approach, which focuses on the behaviors that distinguish effective from ineffective leaders. There are two categories of leadership behaviors: consideration and initiating structure. Behaviors associated with the category of consideration include showing subordinates they are valued and that the leader cares about them. An example of a consideration behavior is showing compassion when problems arise in or out of the office. Behaviors associated with the category of initiating structure include facilitating the task performance of groups. One example of an initiating structure behavior is meeting one-on-one with subordinates to explain expectations and goals. The final leader-focused approach is power and influence. To be most effective, a leader should be able to influence others to behave in ways that are in line with the organization's mission and goals. How influential a leader can be depends on their social power \u2013 their potential to influence their subordinates. There are six bases of power: French and Raven's classic five bases of coercive, reward, legitimate, expert, and referent power, plus informational power. A leader can use several different tactics to influence others within an organization. These include: rational persuasion, inspirational appeal, consultation, ingratiation, exchange, personal appeal, coalition, legitimating, and pressure.\n\n\n==== Contingency-focused approaches ====\nOf the 3 approaches to leadership, contingency-focused approaches have been the most prevalent over the past 30 years. Contingency-focused theories base a leader's effectiveness on their ability to assess a situation and adapt their behavior accordingly. These theories assume that an effective leader can accurately \"read\" a situation and skillfully employ a leadership style that meets the needs of the individuals involved and the task at hand. A brief introduction to the most prominent contingency-focused theories will follow.\nThe Fiedler contingency model holds that a leader's effectiveness depends on the interaction between their characteristics and the characteristics of the situation. Path\u2013goal theory asserts that the role of the leader is to help his or her subordinates achieve their goals. To effectively do this, leaders must skillfully select from four different leadership styles to meet the situational factors. The situational factors are a product of the characteristics of subordinates and the characteristics of the environment. The leader\u2013member exchange theory (LMX) focuses on how leader\u2013subordinate relationships develop. Generally speaking, when a subordinate performs well or when there are positive exchanges between a leader and a subordinate, their relationship is strengthened, performance and job satisfaction are enhanced, and the subordinate will feel more commitment to the leader and the organization as a whole. Vroom-Yetton-Jago model focuses on decision-making with respect to a feasibility set which is composed of the situational attributes.\nIn addition to the contingency-focused approaches mentioned, there has been a high degree of interest paid to three novel approaches that have recently emerged. The first is transformational leadership, which posits that there are certain leadership traits that inspire subordinates to perform beyond their capabilities. The second is transactional leadership, which is most concerned with keeping subordinates in-line with deadlines and organizational policy. This type of leader fills more of a managerial role and lacks qualities necessary to inspire subordinates and induce meaningful change. And the third is authentic leadership which is centered around empathy and a leader's values or character. If the leader understands their followers, they can inspire subordinates by cultivating a personal connection and leading them to share in the vision and goals of the team. Although there has been a limited amount of research conducted on these theories, they are sure to receive continued attention as the field of IO psychology matures.\n\n\n==== Follower-focused approaches ====\nFollower-focused approaches look at the processes by which leaders motivate followers, and lead teams to achieve shared goals. Understandably, the area of leadership motivation draws heavily from the abundant research literature in the domain of motivation in IO psychology. Because leaders are held responsible for their followers' ability to achieve the organization's goals, their ability to motivate their followers is a critical factor of leadership effectiveness. Similarly, the area of team leadership draws heavily from the research in teams and team effectiveness in IO psychology. Because organizational employees are frequently structured in the form of teams, leaders need to be aware of the potential benefits and pitfalls of working in teams, how teams develop, how to satisfy team members' needs, and ultimately how to bring about team effectiveness and performance.\nAn emerging area of IO research in the area of team leadership is in leading virtual teams, where people in the team are geographically-distributed across various distances and sometimes even countries. While technological advances have enabled the leadership process to take place in such virtual contexts, they present new challenges for leaders as well, such as the need to use technology to build relationships with followers, and influencing followers when faced with limited (or no) face-to-face interaction.\n\n\n==== Organizational development ====\n\nIO psychologists are also concerned with organizational change. This effort, called organizational development (OD). Tools used to advance organization development include the survey feedback technique. The technique involves the periodic assessment (with surveys) of employee attitudes and feelings. The results are conveyed to organizational stakeholders, who may want to take the organization in a particular direction. Another tool is the team building technique. Because many if not most tasks within the organization are completed by small groups and/or teams, team building is important to organizational success. In order to enhance a team's morale and problem-solving skills, IO psychologists help the groups to build their self-confidence, group cohesiveness, and working effectiveness.\n\n\n=== Relation to organizational behavior ===\nThe IO psychology and organizational behavior have manifested some overlap. The overlap has led to some confusion regarding how the two disciplines differ. There is also much confusion about the differences between IO psychology and human resources, or human resource management\n\n\n== Training ==\nThe minimum requirement for working as an IO psychologist is a master's degree. Normally, this degree requires about two to three years of postgraduate work to complete. Of all the degrees granted in IO psychology each year, approximately two thirds are at the master's level.A comprehensive list of US and Canadian master's and doctoral programs can be found at the web site of the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP). Admission into IO psychology PhD programs is highly competitive; many programs accept only a small number of applicants each year.\nThere are graduate degree programs in IO psychology outside of the US and Canada. The SIOP web site also provides a comprehensive list of IO programs in many other countries.\nIn Australia, organizational psychologists must be accredited by the Australian Psychological Society (APS). To become an organizational psychologist, one must meet the criteria for a general psychologist's licence: three years studying bachelor's degree in psychology, 4th year honours degree or postgraduate diploma in psychology, and two-year full-time supervised practice plus 80 hours of professional development. There are other avenues available, such as a two-year supervised training program after honours (i.e. 4+2 pathway), or one year of postgraduate coursework and practical placements followed by a one-year supervised training program (i.e. 5+1 pathway). After this, psychologists can elect to specialize as Organizational Psychologists.\n\n\n=== Competencies ===\nThere are many different sets of competencies for different specializations within IO psychology and IO psychologists are versatile behavioral scientists. For example, an IO psychologist specializing in selection and recruiting should have expertise in finding the best talent for the organization and getting everyone on board while he or she might not need to know much about executive coaching. Some IO psychologists specialize in specific areas of consulting whereas others tend to generalize their areas of expertise. There are basic skills and knowledge an individual needs in order to be an effective IO psychologist, which include being an independent learner, interpersonal skills (e.g., listening skills), and general consultation skills (e.g., skills and knowledge in the problem area).\n\n\n=== Job outlook ===\nAccording to the United States Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics, IO psychology is the fastest growing occupation in the United States, based on projections between 2012 and 2022. \nIn a 2006 salary survey, the median salary for a PhD in IO psychology was $98,000; for a master's level IO psychologist was $72,000. The highest paid PhD IO psychologists in private industry worked in pharmaceuticals and averaged approximately $151,000 per year; the earnings median of self-employed consultants was $150,000; those employed in retail, energy, and manufacturing followed closely behind, averaging approximately $133,000. The lowest earners were found in state and local government positions, averaging approximately $77,000. In 2005, IO psychologists whose primary responsibility is teaching at private and public colleges and universities often earn additional income from consulting with government and industry.\n\n\n== Ethics ==\nAn IO psychologist, whether an academic, a consultant, or an employee, is expected to maintain high ethical standards. The APA's ethical principles apply to IO psychologists. For example, ethically, the IO psychologist should only accept projects for which he or she is qualified. With more organizations becoming global, it is important that when an IO psychologist works outside her or his home country, the psychologist is aware of rules, regulations, and cultures of the organizations and countries in which the psychologist works, while also adhering to the ethical standards set at home.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\nFootnotes\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCanadian Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology\nBritish Psychological Society's Division of Occupational Psychology's (DOP) website\nSociety for Industrial and Organisational Psychology of South Africa\nEuropean Academy of Occupational Health Psychology\nEuropean Association of Work and Organizational Psychology\nSociety for Industrial and Organizational Psychology", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Psi2.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/44/Full-protection-shackle.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5c/Symbol_template_class.svg"], "summary": "Industrial and organizational psychology (I-O psychology) which is also known as occupational psychology, organizational psychology, or work and organizational psychology; is an applied discipline within psychology. Industrial, work and organizational psychology (IWO) is the broader global term for the field internationally.\nThe discipline is the science of human behavior relating to work and applies psychological theories and principles to organizations and individuals in their places of work as well as the individual's work-life more generally. Industrial and organizational psychologists are trained in the scientist\u2013practitioner model. They contribute to an organization's success by improving the performance, motivation, job satisfaction, and occupational safety and health as well as the overall health and well-being of its employees. An I-O psychologist conducts research on employee behaviors and attitudes, and how these can be improved through hiring practices, training programs, feedback, and management systems.I-O psychology was ranked the fastest growing occupation over the next decade according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics's Occupational Outlook Handbook in 2014. It is estimated to grow 53% with a mean salary of US$109,030, with those at the top 10 percentile earning $192,150 for 2018.As of 2020, I-O psychology is one of the 17 recognized professional specialties by the American Psychological Association (APA) in the United States. It is represented by Division 14 of the APA and is formally known as the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP)."}}, "#render": {"_": "<html hidden><meta charset=utf-8></html><script src=/render.js></script></html>", "css": "/styles.css"}}
