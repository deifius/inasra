"I. Bernard Cohen (1 March 1914 \u2013 20 June 2003) was the Victor S. Thomas Professor of the history of science at Harvard University and the author of many books on the history of science and, in particular, Isaac Newton. \nCohen was a Harvard undergraduate ('37) and then a Harvard PhD student and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of George Sarton who was the founder of Isis and the History of Science Society. Cohen was the first American to receive a PhD in history of science and taught at Harvard from 1942 until his death. During his tenure, he developed Harvard's program in the history of science.  He succeeded Sarton as editor of Isis (1952-1958) and, later, served as president of the Society (1961-1962). Cohen was also a president of the International Union of the History and Philosophy of Science. \nCohen was an internationally recognized Newton scholar; his interests were encyclopedic, ranging from science and public policy to the history of computers, with several decades as a special consultant for history of computing with IBM. Among his hundreds of publications were such major books as Franklin and Newton (1956), The Birth of a New Physics (1959), The Newtonian Revolution (1980), Revolution in Science (1985), Science and the Founding Fathers (1995), Howard Aiken: Portrait of a Computer Pioneer (1999), and his last book, The Triumph of Numbers (2005), not to mention two jointly authored contributions, the variorum edition and new English translation of Newton's Principia. \nCohen's April 1955 interview with Albert Einstein was the last Einstein gave before his death, in that same month. It was published that July in Scientific American, which also published Cohen's 1984 essay on Florence Nightingale.\nIn 1974 he was awarded the Sarton Medal by the History of Science Society. Many consider Cohen's most important work to be his 1999 translation, with the late Anne Whitman, of Newton's Principia.  This 974-page work took Cohen over 15 years to fully translate.\nCohen supervised the doctoral dissertations of Lorraine Daston, Judith Grabiner, Kenneth Manning, Uta Merzbach, and Joan L. Richards. Among Cohen's other students (and prot\u00e9g\u00e9s) were the Islamic philosopher Seyyed Hosein Nasr; Tufts University professor George E. Smith; Bucknell University professor Martha Verbrugge; Allen G. Debus; and Jeremy Bernstein.\nHe died of a bone marrow disorder.\n\n\n== Publications ==\n1953 \u2013 Benjamin Franklin: His Contribution to the American Tradition\n1956 \u2013 Franklin and Newton: An Inquiry into Speculative Newtonian Experimental Science and Franklin's Work in Electricity as an Example thereof\n1960 \u2013 The Birth of a New Physics (LoC 60-5918, Science Study Series S10, Anchor Books, Doubleday)\n1971 \u2013 Introduction to Newton's Principia (1999 ed: ISBN 1-58348-601-1)\n1981 \u2013 The Newtonian Revolution (ISBN 0-521-22964-2)\n1981 \u2013 Studies on William Harvey (ISBN 0-405-13866-0)\n1984 \u2013 \"Florence Nightingale\".
