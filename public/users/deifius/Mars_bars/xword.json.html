It was first manufactured in 1932 in Slough, England by Forrest Mars, Sr. In its British version the bar consists of caramel and nougat coated with milk chocolate. An American version of the Mars bar was produced which had nougat and toasted almonds covered in milk chocolate; later, caramel was added to the recipe as well. The American version was discontinued in 2002, then revived in a slightly different form the following year under the name \"Snickers Almond\".\n\n\n== Versions ==\n\n\n=== UK and worldwide ===\n\nIn most of the world, a Mars bar is a candy bar with nougat and caramel, coated with milk chocolate, but without almonds. In the United States it is called a Milky Way.It was first manufactured under the Mars bar name in 1932 in Slough, England by Forrest Mars, Sr., son of American candy maker Frank C. Mars. He modelled it after his father's Milky Way bar, which was already popular in the US, adjusting the recipe to better suit European tastes. He had a staff of twelve people, and originally advertised it as using Cadbury's chocolate couverture. The bar and the proportions of the main components have changed over the years. With minor variations, this version is sold worldwide, except for the US, and is packaged in a black wrapper with red gold-edged lettering.\nIn 2002, the Mars bar was reformulated and its logo was updated with a more cursive appearance except in Australia where it is still has the pre-2002 logo. Its price also increased. The nougat was made lighter, the chocolate on top became thinner, and the overall weight of the bar was reduced slightly. The slogan \"Pleasure you can't measure\" was intended to appeal more to women and youths.Various sizes are made (sizes as of 2008): miniature bars called \"Fun Size\" (19.7 g) and \"Snack Time\" (36.5 g) (both sold in multiple packs); a larger multi-pack size of 54 g; the regular sized single 58 g bar and a \"king-size\" 84 g bar which has since been replaced by \"Mars Duo\" (85 g) \u2013 a pack that contains 2 smaller bars of 42.5 g each instead of 1 large one. The regular 58 g single bar contains 260 calories.In the second half of 2008, Mars UK reduced the weight of regular bars from 62.5 g to 58 g. Although the reduction in size was not publicised at the time, Mars claimed the change was designed to help tackle the obesity crisis in the UK. The company later confirmed that the real reason for the change was rising costs. In 2013, the \"standard\" Mars bar was further reduced to 51 g, bringing the change to around 20% in 5 years.In May 2009 the Mars bar size reduced from 60g to 53g in Australia, citing portion sizes and the obesity debate as the primary driver.\n\n\n=== United States ===\n\nIn the United States a Mars bar is a candy bar with nougat and toasted almonds coated with milk chocolate. The same candy bar is known outside the United States as a Mars Almond bar. Originally it didn't have caramel, but at some point caramel was added to it.\nIt was discontinued in 2002, relaunched in January 2010 (initially exclusively through Walmart stores), discontinued again at the end of 2011, and relaunched again in September 2016 by Ethel M. Chocolates, a gourmet chocolate subsidiary of Mars, Inc.. The 2016 version is the \"original American recipe\", which doesn't have caramel. It's available in their stores and on Amazon.com.In 2003 the company introduced a replacement called Snickers Almond. It's similar to the Mars bar, containing nougat, almonds, caramel, and a milk chocolate coating, although there are some differences. For example, the almonds are in smaller pieces in Snickers Almond than in the Mars bar.\nThe European version of the Mars bar is also sold in some United States grocery stores.\n\n\n== Spinoff products ==\nOther products have also been released using the Mars branding.\n\nMars Delight (discontinued in the UK as of 2009)\nMars Extra Chocolate Drink\nMars Active Energy Drink\nMars No Added Sugar Drink\nMars Ice Cream bars\nMars Midnight Ice Cream bars\nMcVities Mars Mini Rolls\nMars Biscuits (Australia and the UK  \u2013 a biscuit with Mars topping)\nMars Pods (Australia and New Zealand \u2013 a small crunchy wafer shell with Mars filling, also available in variants)\nMars Rocks\nMars Planets\nMars Mix\nMars Frozen Dessert Bar\nMars Protein \u2013 A mars bar with less sugar and added protein, this comes as a 50g size. Packaging claims \"More protein, 40% less sugar\" to a normal mars bar.\n\n\n== Custom packaging ==\n\nThe Original Mars bar in \"Believe\" packaging was sold in the UK from 18 April 2006 until the end of the 2006 FIFA World Cup in July. \"Believe\" took prominence on the packaging (\"Original Mars\" appeared in smaller print) to indicate support for the England national football team. Advertising in other nations of the UK was tailored to reflect their own teams after the public condemnation, although in Scotland the \"Believe\" packaging was still used \u2013 causing negative publicity.On 30 July 2008, the Tasmanian government announced that it had secured a major sponsor, Mars for a bid to enter the Australian Football League in a deal worth $4 million over 3 years and will temporarily change the name of its top-selling chocolate bar in Australia to Believe, to help promote Tasmania's cause.Mars were re-branded \"Hopp\" (engl. \"Go!\") in Switzerland during UEFA Euro 2008. Like the \"Believe\" packaging sold in the UK in 2006, \"Original Mars\" was also shown in smaller print.In 2010, to promote England's involvement in the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the background of the UK Mars packaging became the St. George cross.\n\n\n== Advertising slogans ==\n\n\n=== Former ===\n\"Maxis from Mars\" \u2013 United Kingdom (1969) A number of white Austin Maxis were driven around the country with numbers on the doors and if the number inside your Mars wrapper matched the Maxi you would see driving around your area, you won that very car.\n\"Mars bringt verbrauchte Energie sofort zur\u00fcck.\" (Mars resplenishes lost energy instantaneously) - Germany (1960s) \n\"Mars macht mobil bei Arbeit, Sport und Spiel\" (Mars mobilises you at work, sports and play) \u2013 Germany (1980s and 1990s)\n\"A Mars a day helps you work, rest and play\" \u2013 Australia, United Kingdom, Canada, New Zealand\n\"Out of this world!\" \u2013 Australia, UK\n\"Earth \u2013 what you'd eat if you lived on Mars\" \u2013 New Zealand\n\"Another way to make your day\" \u2013 UK (2005)\n\"Feels good to be back! \" \u2013 Australia (2005)\n\"An almond in every bite!\" \u2013 US\n\"Un Mars, et \u00e7a repart\" (A Mars, and you're off again) \u2013 France (late 1990s and renewed from 2006)\n\"Mars, que du bonheur\" (Mars, only happiness) \u2013 France\n\"Mars, haal eruit wat erin zit!\" (Mars, get the most out of it!) \u2013 The Netherlands and Flanders, Belgium\n\"Who knows?

First reports of battered Mars bars being sold in Stonehaven, Scotland date back to 1995. The product is \"not authorised or endorsed\" by Mars, Inc.Deep-fried Mars bars are available from some fish-and-chip shops in the UK (mainly in Scotland), Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Ireland and the United States.A similar dish has appeared in Kathmandu, Nepal where momo (dumplings) have used Mars bars as fillings.\n\n\n== Recalls ==\nIn July 2005, Mars bars, along with the Snickers bar, were recalled due to an anonymous extortion attempt against Star City Casino in Sydney. The extortionist claimed to have poisoned seven Mars and Snickers bars at random stores in New South Wales. As a result, Masterfoods Corporation, the company that manufactures Mars bars in Australia, recalled the entire Mars and Snickers product from store shelves in New South Wales. Nineteen people were possibly affected, with two being admitted to hospital. In the later half of August 2005, the threat to the public was deemed negligible and the bars returned to shelves.In February 2016, Mars, Snickers and various other Mars, Inc. chocolate products were recalled in 55 countries in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The precautionary recall was issued after a customer found pieces of plastic in a Snickers bar purchased in Germany. The error was traced back to a Mars, Inc. factory in Veghel, The Netherlands.\n\n\n== Animal products controversy ==\nIn May 2007 Mars UK announced that Mars bars, along with many of their other products such as Snickers, Maltesers, Minstrels and Twix would no longer be suitable for vegetarians because of the introduction of rennet, a chemical sourced from calves' stomachs used in the production of whey.The rabbinical authorities declared that the products remained kosher for Jewish consumption.The decision was condemned by several groups, with the Vegetarian Society stating that \"at a time when more and more consumers are concerned about the provenance of their food, Mars' decision to use non-vegetarian whey is a backward step\".\nMars later abandoned these plans, stating that it became \"very clear, very quickly\" that it had made a mistake.\n\n\n== Economics ==\nIt has been observed on several occasions that the price of a Mars bar correlates fairly accurately with the change in value of the pound sterling since World War II, much in the way that the Big Mac Index has proven to be a good indicator of the actual relative purchasing power of world currencies.\n\n\n== Popular culture ==\nNorthern Irish pop-punk band The Undertones wrote and recorded a song called \"Mars Bars\", released as a B-side in 1979.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Visible Mars bar project, which shows the difference between US and UK Mars bars.\nSite with cross-sections of both the original US and Canadian Mars bars\nSlough History Online\nTelevision commercial for original US Mars bar showing ingredients", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/DeepFriedMarsBar.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/MBar_700.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Mars-Almond-split.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/Mars-Delight-Whole-%26-Split.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Mars.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f1/Mars_Believe_Bar.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f1/Mars_bar_logo.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/99/Question_book-new.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b2/US-Mars-Wrapper-Small.jpg"], "summary": "Mars, commonly known as Mars bar, is the name of two varieties of chocolate bar produced by Mars, Incorporated.

It was ranked as the 6th largest privately held company in the United States by Forbes. Headquartered in McLean, Virginia, United States, the company is entirely owned by the Mars family. Mars operates in five business segments around the world: Mars Wrigley Confectionery (headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, with US headquarters in Hackettstown and Newark, New Jersey), Petcare (Zaventem, Belgium; Poncitl\u00e1n and Jalisco, Mexico; Quer\u00e9taro, Mexico), Food (Rancho Dominguez, California), Drinks (West Chester, Pennsylvania), and Symbioscience (Germantown, Maryland), the company's life sciences division.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nMars is a company known for the confectionery items that it creates, such as Mars bars, Milky Way bars, M&M's, Skittles, Snickers, and Twix.  They also produce non-confectionery snacks, such as Combos, and other foods, including Uncle Ben's Rice, and pasta sauce brand Dolmio, as well as pet foods, such as Pedigree, Whiskas, Nutro and Royal Canin brands.Orbit gum is among the most popular brands, managed by the Mars subsidiary brand Wrigley. During World War II, Wrigley was selling their eponymous gum only to soldiers, while Orbit was sold to the public. Though abandoned shortly after the war, about 30 years later Orbit made a comeback in America during the chewing gum craze.Franklin Clarence Mars, whose mother taught him to hand dip candy, sold candy by age 19. He started the Mars Candy Factory in 1911 with Ethel V. Mars, his second wife, in Tacoma, Washington. This factory produced and sold fresh candy wholesale, but ultimately the venture failed because there was a better established business, Brown & Haley, also operating in Tacoma. By 1920, Mars had returned to his home state, Minnesota, where the earliest incarnation of the present day Mars company was founded that year as Mar-O-Bar Co., in Minneapolis and later incorporated there as Mars, Incorporated.Forrest Mars, Sr., son of Frank and his first wife, Veronica, was inspired by a popular type of milkshake in 1923, to introduce the Milky Way bar, advertised as a \"chocolate malted milk in a candy bar\", which became the best-selling candy bar. In 1929, Frank moved the company to Bakersfield, California and started full production in a plant which still exists today. In 1930, Frank Mars created the Snickers bar and first sold it in US markets. In 1932, Mars introduced the 3 Musketeers bar. The same year, Forrest started Mars Limited in the United Kingdom and launched the Mars bar.\nMars moved its headquarters to McLean, Virginia, in 1984. It is still a family business owned by the Mars family. The company is famous for its secrecy. A 1993 Washington Post Magazine article was a rare raising of the veil, as the reporter was able to see the \"M\"s being applied to the M&M's, something that \"no out-sider had ever before been invited to observe\". In 1999, for example, the company did not acknowledge that Forrest Mars, Sr. had died or that he had worked for the company.Mars' purchase of Doane Petcare Company in June 2007 significantly increased Mars' position in the U.S. dry pet food category. In addition to these businesses, Mars also operates a chain of premium chocolate shops called Ethel M Chocolates.  These shops are an outgrowth of the Ethel M premium chocolate business that Forrest Mars started in Las Vegas in 1980, when he became bored with retirement.In 2008 Mars and theBelGroup has conducted research study which resulted in resurrecting the famous Mars slogan \u201cWork, Rest & Play\u201d.\nPackaged and led global launch of Mars Refuel Sports drink. Initiated and implemented sponsorship programme \u201cThe Mars Refuel Drink Fund\u201d. On April 28, 2008, Mars, Incorporated, together with Berkshire Hathaway Incorporated, announced the buyout of Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company, the world's largest chewing gum producer, for $23 billion in an all-cash deal.  The two companies together generate sales in excess of $30 billion.The company published its Principles in Action communication in September 2011. This communication outlines the history of Mars, its legacy as a business committed to its Five Principles, and the company's goal of putting its Principles into action to make a difference to people and the planet through performance. Encompassing themes of Health and Nutrition, Supply Chain, Operations, Products, and Working at Mars, the Principles in Action communication outlines Mars Incorporated's targets, progress, and ongoing challenges. It also describes its businesses, including Petcare, Chocolate, Wrigley, Food, Drinks, Symbioscience.The company spent more than $1.8 million on lobbying during 2008, almost all of it at Patton Boggs, where it has long been one of the largest lobbying clients. Mars also spent $10,000 at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. In 2009, Mars also hired Ernst & Young to lobby on corporate and international tax issues, including issues related to tax changes proposed by the Obama administration. The company spent another $1,655,000 that year.In 2014, Mars opened a new $270 million chocolate plant in Topeka, Kansas, the first new plant in the US in 35 years.In 2016, Mars announced the merger of its chocolate and Wrigley segments to form a new subsidiary, appropriately called Mars Wrigley Confectionery.In 2017, the company's confectionery segment announced a return to its roots, and opened a new office in Newark, New Jersey.In May 2020, Mars filed a lawsuit against JAB Holding over claims that Jacek Szarzynski, a former JAB Holding executive stole various confidential documents and passed them to the owner of Pret A Manger and Panera Bread. According to the lawsuit, over 6,000 Mars internal documents, including detailed financial results, strategic planning documents, and potential acquisition targets, were illegally downloaded.In the United States, the company has 22 manufacturing facilities in Hackettstown, New Jersey; Albany, Georgia; Burr Ridge, Illinois; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Chicago, Illinois; and Mattoon, Illinois; Cleveland, Tennessee; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Columbia, South Carolina; Columbus, Ohio; Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania; Greenville, Mississippi; Greenville and Waco, Texas; Henderson and Reno, Nevada; Fort Smith, Arkansas; Joplin, Missouri; Kansas City, Missouri; Miami, Oklahoma; and Galena, Kansas. Their newest facility is situated in Topeka, Kansas. Their Canadian facilities are located in Bolton and Newmarket, Ontario.\n\n\n== Mars Food UK Limited ==\nMars Food UK Limited is the name of the United Kingdom branch of Mars, Inc. The company is based in Slough, England. Mars brands manufactured for the United Kingdom market but not for the United States include Tunes.In 1932, Forrest Mars, Sr., opened what was then Mars (Europe) headquarters, and remains Mars (UK) headquarters in Slough, Berkshire on the then-new Slough Trading Estate, after a disagreement with his father, Franklin Clarence Mars. In this factory, he produced the first Mars bar, based on the American Milky Way.Many brands first created and sold in the United Kingdom were later introduced in the United States, including Starburst (original UK brand name Opal Fruits) and Skittles. The brands Twix and Topic were UK based.Milky Way in Europe and worldwide is known as the 3 Musketeers in America. Similarly, the Snickers bar was previously marketed in Ireland and the United Kingdom as Marathon until 1990; in the UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands, also until 1990; Galaxy in the Middle East is known as Dove in America and worldwide; and Starburst was known in the UK and Ireland as Opal Fruits until 1998. Chocolate and peanut M&M's were introduced in 1990.In November 2020, Mars acquired full ownership of snack food company Kind North America for $5 billion.\n\n\n=== Mars Drinks UK ===\nMars Drinks UK, the beverages division of Mars Limited, operates from Basingstoke in Hampshire and specializes in office vending machines. Mars Drinks UK comprises the FLAVIA and KLIX brands which offer branded drinks such as the Starburst Orange Drink, the Maltesers Hot Chocolate and the Galaxy drinks.Mars Drinks also produces coffee and the equipment used to make it. In 1982 FLAVIA was created out of the high demand for coffee in the United Kingdom. Initially marketed as Dimension 3 until 1989, FLAVIA was introduced in France and Germany in 1986 and Japan in 1992 then brought to the United States in 1996 and to Canada in 1997. Other products such as cappuccino were introduced in 2002 and tea in 2004.In 2018, the Drinks division was sold to Lavazza.\n\n\n== Mars Petcare ==\nForrest Mars started the pet food industry in Europe, and his Mars Candy Company bought Kal Kan. Forrest Mars changed the name of Kal Kan dog food to Pedigree, and Kal Kan cat food to Whiskas. As of 1991, Mars controlled 60 percent of the pet food market, both in volume and value. Whiskas was the number one brand. As of 1994, Mars was the leading pet food company worldwide with $4 billion in sales.In February 2003, Mars acquired Aquarium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (API, incorporated in 1964) and in 2007 it was renamed Mars Fishcare, Inc. The company manufactures and supplies home aquarium and pond products. Mars Fishcare brands include: Aquarium Pharmaceuticals (API), RENA, AQUARIAN, and PondCare.The company introduced a genetic test for dogs using cheek swabs to identify breed breakdown, trait tests and health risks in 2007 known as Wisdom Panel. In 2018, Mars Petcare acquired Genoscoper Laboratories, a Finnish animal molecular diagnostics company, \"to form the basis for future practical applications in enabling precision healthcare for pets\" under its genetic testing unit, Wisdom Health. Wisdom Panel DNA testing expanded to include cats in mid 2021.In Australia, the division operates three sites that are located in Wodonga, Victoria (established in 1967 for manufacture of wet pet food); Bathurst, New South Wales (established in the 1980s for manufacture of dry pet food); and Brisbane, Queensland (for manufacture of birdcare products).Mars Petcare manufactures the 'Trill\" birdseed range.\n\n\n=== Mars Veterinary Health ===\nIn 2007, Mars, Incorporated purchased a significant stake in the Banfield Pet Hospital chain.In October 2015, BluePearl Veterinary Partners was acquired by Mars Petcare division. This acquisition resulted in Mars Petcare becoming the largest pet nutrition and veterinary care provider in the world.In January 2017, Mars Veterinary Health North America announced the US$7.7 billion acquisition of Los Angeles-based animal hospital chain VCA Inc.In June 2018, Mars Veterinary Health International and Diagnostics acquired the Linnaeus Group consolidating its position as a leading veterinary provider in the United Kingdom.\n\n\n== Factories ==\nIn 1963, a large factory was opened in Veghel in the Netherlands. This factory has currently the biggest production volume of Mars factories and is one of the biggest chocolate factories in the world. Most confectionery products for Europe were produced in Slough and Veghel. The two factories in Slough were located on Liverpool Road and Dundee Road; the one on Liverpool Road closed in 2007, with Twix production moving to the Netherlands and Starburst production moving to the Czech Republic.The major production plant for Mars confectionery products in Australia is in Ballarat, Victoria.There is one factory outside of Hershey, Pennsylvania. It is located in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania.\nThe factory in Chicago, Illinois, has its own commuter rail station, simply named Mars.\n\n\n== Consumer relations ==\n\n\n=== Opposition to labeling of genetically engineered ingredients in California ===\nThroughout 2012, Mars contributed $376,650 to a $46 million political campaign known as \"The Coalition Against The Costly Food Labeling Proposition, sponsored by Farmers and Food Producers\". This organization was set up to oppose \"Proposition 37\", demanding mandatory labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients.\n\n\n=== Removal of artificial ingredients to food portfolio ===\nIn February 2016, Mars stated that it would no longer be using artificial colors in each of its candy products. The company announced that more than 50 of its products would be affected in commitment effort to align with the changing preferences of consumers. The company along with more than 12 others has recently pledged to remove artificial colors from its products. While it has been said that the use of artificial colors in candy, and other products do not pose a threat to human health outright, the preference of natural ingredients by consumers has grown substantially.\nThe company was not the first to recently announce that it would be changing the use of artificial flavors in its products. In 2015, food giant, General Mills proposed an initiative that noted that all of the artificial ingredients it was using in its products would be dropped by 2017. This meant a reformulation of many of the cereals, with alternatives that were more suitable to the palates of humans. A key aspect in that proposed initiative was that the cereal, Trix, would no longer have the blue and green colors forming a new iteration of the cereal.There have been two different arguments presented about the use of artificial colors in foods. Many studies have shown that their use in food could be linked to illnesses such as ADHD and cancer. There has seemed to be an issue with the use of red 40, yellow 3, yellow 5 and yellow 6 and how they bind to the DNA in humans. Other additives such as Blue 2 have been linked to the cause of brain tumors in rodents and, in 1981, Green 3 was found to be a direct link to bladder cancer. Given the fact that the company will be replacing the artificial dyes in its products, the company has also said that consumers should prepare themselves for the transition process in terms of special packaging and colors being used as to indicate that the changes have taken place. It has been said that the company is not likely to stop using coloring entirely, but that the use of artificial coloring will be going away.\nInstead Mars will use natural colors like turmeric in India.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\n\n\n=== Animal vs vegetable ingredients ===\nFrom May 1, 2007, many Mars products made in the UK became unsuitable for vegetarians. The company announced that it would be using whey made with animal rennet (material from a calf's stomach lining, and a byproduct of veal), instead of using rennet made by microorganisms, in products including Mars, Twix, Snickers, Maltesers, Bounty, Minstrels and Milky Way. The response from many consumers, particularly the Vegetarian Society's request for UK vegetarians to register their protests with Mars, generated extensive press and caused the company to abandon the plans shortly thereafter. Mars switched to all-vegetarian sources in the UK.\n\n\n=== Unethical treatment of animals ===\nIn 2007, Mars came under criticism from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) for funding laboratory experiments on mice, rats, guinea pigs and rabbits, which the group alleges are inhumane and in violation of the company's own policies prohibiting experiments on animals.One study was conducted in collaboration with the Salk Institute regarding angiogenesis and spatial memory, in which mice were given an ad-lib diet that included epicatechin, plant-derived flavonoid. One of the experiments involved groups of control and experimental animals, the latter of which were housed individually in cages that included a running wheel for optional exercise for two hours a day. The former, also housed individually, did not have access to a running wheel. Another experiment was the classical spatial memory assay, the Morris water maze, in which experimenters had mice swim in water mixed with white paint that concealed the water depth. The study, which Mars contends was legally required in order for the company to make flavonoid-related health claims, showed that the inclusion of epicatechin in the diet improved memory and angiogenesis, more so if coupled with exercise.\n\n\n=== Child labor and slave labor ===\nMars has been criticized for buying cocoa beans from West African farmers who reportedly use unpaid or poorly paid child laborers. In 2009, Mars announced that the company would work towards only purchasing cocoa from suppliers who meet environmental, labor, and production standards. TransFair USA, an organization which certifies products as Fair Trade, applauded the move and expressed hope that it would include a provision for fair wages for laborers and farmers. In 2010, Mars Inc. received the U.S. Secretary of State's Award for Corporate Excellence. In April 2010, Mars launched the MyCocoaPaper initiative, which claims to provide economic opportunities to women and families in Indonesia by making paper products out of cocoa bark and recycled office paper.In 2011, Mars and Fairtrade International announced an agreement to introduce the first Fairtrade labeled Mars product and to work together to enable farmers to have sustainable livelihoods and substantially increased productivity. The first Mars product to carry the Fairtrade mark was Maltesers, which appeared in stores in 2012 in the UK and Ireland.In 2019, Mars announced that they couldn't guarantee that their chocolate products were free from child slave labor, as they could trace only 24% of their purchasing back to the farm level. The Washington Post noted that the commitment taken in 2001 to eradicate such practices within 4 years had not been kept, neither at the due deadline of 2005, nor within the revised deadlines of 2008 and  2010, and that the result was not likely to be achieved for 2020 either.In 2021, Mars was named in a class action lawsuit filed by eight former child slaves from Mali who alleged that the company aided and abetted their enslavement on cocoa plantations in Ivory Coast. The suit accused Mars (along with Nestl\u00e9, Cargill, Barry Callebaut, Olam International, The Hershey Company, and Mondelez International) of knowingly engaging in forced labor, and the plaintiffs sought damages for unjust enrichment, negligent supervision, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\n\n=== Deforestation in African national parks ===\nIn September 2017, an investigation conducted by NGO Mighty Earth found that a large amount of the cocoa used in chocolate produced by Mars and other major chocolate companies was grown illegally in national parks and other protected areas in Ivory Coast and Ghana. The countries are the world's two largest cocoa producers.The report documents show, in several national parks and other protected areas, 90% or more of the land mass has been converted to cocoa. Less than four percent of Ivory Coast remains densely forested, and the chocolate companies' laissez-faire approach to sourcing has driven extensive deforestation in Ghana as well. In Ivory Coast, deforestation has pushed chimpanzees into just a few small pockets, and reduced the country's elephant population from several hundred thousand to about 200\u2013400.\n\n\n== Products ==\nMany Mars products are household, famous-name brands. Some of these product lines are manufactured by Mars; others are manufactured by The Wrigley Company.\n\n\n=== Original food products ===\n\n\n==== Confectionery products manufactured by The Wrigley Company ====\n\n\n=== Products for pet consumption ===\n\n\n=== Discontinued product linesAquaDrops ===\nBisc &\nCookies &\nPacers\nPB Max\nRoyals\nSpangles\nSummit Cookie Bars\nBanjo Candy Bar\nBliss Candy Bar\n\n\n== Veterinary services ==\nMars Veterinary Health North America \n\nBanfield Pet Hospital \u2013 1,054 sites\nVCA Animal Hospitals \u2013 917 sites\nPet Partners \u2013 86 sites\nBluePearl Veterinary Partners \u2013 61 sitesMars Veterinary Health International\n\nAniCura \u2013 280 sites\nAntech Diagnostics / Sound\nAsia Veterinary Diagnostics\nLinnaeus Veterinary Group \u2013 148 sites\nMount Pleasant Veterinary Group\nVeterinary Emergency & Specialty (VES) Hospital Singapore\nVSH Hong Kong\n\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nThe company was named by Fortune magazine as one of the top 100 companies to work for in 2013, citing the example that employees of the pet food division can take their dogs to work.The company has made donations to Elizabethtown College, which includes a room sponsored by them and a weekly executive lecture series.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\nBig Chocolate\nList of food companies\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nStephen Beckett, Industrial Chocolate Manufacture and Use, Fourth Edition, Wiley-Blackwell, 2008 ISBN 978-1-4051-3949-6.\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website \nMars, Incorporated companies grouped at OpenCorporates\nSymbioscience\nMasterfoods (archived)\nCocoa Sustainability Initiative (archived)", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e1/5_gum_package.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Bounty-Split.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d7/Dog_Food.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Flag_of_Virginia.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Foodlogo2.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Galaxy_Minstrels_formerly_known_as_Minstrels.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Increase2.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Industry5.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Mars_Incorporated_2019_logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Old_Mars_Logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Twix-broken.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg"], "summary": "Mars, Incorporated is an American multinational manufacturer of confectionery, pet food, and other food products and a provider of animal care services, with US$33 billion in annual sales in 2015.

It also manufactures baked products, such as cookies and cakes, and sells beverages like milkshakes, and many more that are produced globally. Its headquarters are in Hershey, Pennsylvania, which is also home to Hersheypark and Hershey's Chocolate World. It was founded by Milton S. Hershey in 1894 as the Hershey Chocolate Company, a subsidiary of his Lancaster Caramel Company. The Hershey Trust Company owns a minority stake but retains a majority of the voting power within the company.Hershey's chocolate is available across the United States, and in over 60 countries worldwide. They have three large distribution centers, with modern technology and labor management systems. In addition, Hershey is a member of the World Cocoa Foundation. It is also associated with the Hersheypark Stadium and the Giant Center.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Early years ===\n\nAfter an apprenticeship to a confectioner in 1873, Milton S. Hershey opened a candy shop in Philadelphia. This shop was open for six years, after which Hershey apprenticed with another confectioner in Denver, where he learned to make caramel. After another failed business attempt in New York, Hershey returned to Pennsylvania, where he founded the Lancaster Caramel Company in 1886.\nThe use of fresh milk in caramels proved successful, and in 1900, after seeing chocolate-making machines for the first time at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Hershey sold his caramel company for $1,000,000 (equal to $31,108,000 today), and concentrated on chocolate. To people who questioned him, he said, \"Caramels are just a fad, but chocolate is a permanent thing.\"\nIn 1896, Hershey built a milk-processing plant so he could create and refine a recipe for his milk chocolate candies.  In 1899, he developed the Hershey process, which is less sensitive to milk quality than traditional methods. In 1900, he began manufacturing Hershey's Milk Chocolate Bars, also known as Hershey's Bars or Hershey Bars.\n\n\n=== Expansion ===\n\nIn 1903, Hershey began construction of a chocolate plant in his hometown of Derry Church, Pennsylvania, later known as Hershey, Pennsylvania. The town was an inexpensive place for the workers and their families to live, though the factory was built without windows, so that employees would not be distracted.  To increase employee morale, Hershey provided leisure activities and created what would later become Hersheypark.  The milk chocolate bars from this plant proved popular, and the company grew rapidly.\nIn 1907, he introduced a new candy: bite-sized, flat-bottomed, conical pieces of chocolate that he named \"Hershey's Kiss\".  At first, each was wrapped by hand in a square of aluminum foil. The introduction of machine wrapping in 1921 sped up the process and added a small paper ribbon to the top of the package, indicating that it was a genuine Hershey product. Today, 70 candies are produced daily.Other products introduced included Mr. Goodbar (1925) (peanuts in milk chocolate), Hershey's Syrup (1926), semisweet chocolate chips (1928), and the Krackel bar with crisped rice (1938).\n\n\n=== Reese's Peanut Butter Cups ===\nHarry Burnett Reese invented Reese's Peanut Butter Cups after founding the H.B. Reese Candy Company in 1923. Reese died on May 16, 1956, in West Palm Beach, Florida, leaving the company to his six sons. On July 2, 1963, the H.B. Reese Candy Company merged with the Hershey Chocolate Corporation in a tax-free stock-for-stock merger. In 2020, after 57 years of stock splits, the original 666,316 shares of Hershey common stock received by the Reese family represented 16 million Hershey shares valued at $2.5 billion, paying annual dividends of $51.4 million. In 1969, only 6 years after the Reese/Hershey merger, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups became The Hershey Company's top seller. As of September 20, 2012, Reese's was the best-selling candy brand in the United States, with sales of $2.603 billion, and the fourth-best-selling brand globally, with sales of $2.679 billion. \nOnly $76 million (2.8%) of its sales are outside the United States.\n\n\n=== Unionization ===\nLabor unrest came to Hershey in the late 1930s, as a Congress of Industrial Organizations-backed union attempted to organize the factory workers.  A failed sit-down strike in 1937 ended in violence; loyalist workers and local dairy farmers beat many of the strikers as they attempted to leave the plant.  By 1940, an affiliate of the American Federation of Labor had successfully organized Hershey's workers under the leadership of John Shearer, who became the first president of Local Chapter Number 464 of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union.  Local 464 still represents the Hershey workforce.\n\n\n=== M&M's ===\n\nShortly before World War II, Bruce Murrie, son of long-time Hershey's president William F.R. Murrie, struck a deal with Forrest Mars to create hard sugar-coated chocolate that would be called M&M's (for Mars and Murrie). Murrie had a 20% interest in the product, which used Hershey chocolate during World War II rationing. In 1948, Mars bought out Murrie and became one of Hershey's main competitors.\n\n\n=== Kit Kat and Rolo ===\nIn 1969, Hershey received a license from Rowntree's to manufacture and market Kit Kat and Rolo in the United States. After Hershey's competitor Nestl\u00e9 acquired Rowntree's in 1988, it was still required to honor the agreement, and so Hershey continues to make and market the products in the U.S. The license would revert to Nestl\u00e9 if Hershey were sold. This became a sticking point in Hershey's failed attempt to attract a serious buyer in 2002, and even Nestl\u00e9 rejected Hershey's asking price, feeling that the economics would not work.\n\n\n=== Cadbury's ===\nIn 1988, Hershey's acquired the rights to manufacture and distribute many Cadbury-branded products in the United States (except gum and mints, which are part of Mondel\u0113z International).  In 2015, they sued a British importer to halt imports of British Cadbury chocolate, which reportedly angered consumers. A merger between Mondel\u0113z and Hershey's was considered but abandoned in 2016 after Hershey's turned down a $23 billion cash-and-stock bid.\n\n\n=== Other 20th-century sales and acquisitions ===\nIn 1977, Hershey acquired Y&S Candies, founded in 1845, and became the makers of Twizzlers licorice candies.\nIn 1986, Hershey's made a brief foray into cough drops when it acquired the Luden's cough drops brand. By 2001, though, the brand had been sold to Pharmacia (now part of Pfizer), and Luden's eventually became a product of Prestige Brands. Hershey's kept Luden's 5th Avenue bar.\nIn 1996, Hershey purchased the American operations of the Leaf Candy Company from Huhtam\u00e4ki. In 1999, the Hershey Pasta Group was divested to several equity partners to form the New World Pasta company (now part of Ebro Foods).\n\n\n=== 21st century ===\nOn July 25, 2002, it became known that the Hershey Trust Company was seeking to sell its controlling interest in the Hershey Foods Corporation. The value of Hershey stock rose 25% in a single day, with over 19 million shares traded. Over the following 55 days, widespread press coverage, as well as pressure from Pennsylvania Attorney General Mike Fisher, the community of Hershey, and Dauphin County Orphans' Court Senior Judge Warren G. Morgan, led to the sale being abandoned. The seven Hershey trustees who voted to sell Hershey Foods on September 17, 2002, for US$12.5 billion to the William Wrigley Jr. Company (now part of Mars Incorporated) were removed by Attorney General Fisher and Judge Morgan. Ten of the 17 trustees were forced to resign and four new members who lived locally were appointed. The former Pennsylvania Attorney General, LeRoy S. Zimmerman, became the new chairman of the reconstituted Milton Hershey School Trustees. Mr. Zimmerman has publicly committed to having the Milton Hershey School Trust always retain its interest in The Hershey Company.\nIn December 2004, Hershey acquired the Mauna Loa Macadamia Nut Corp. from The Shansby Group.\n\nIn 2005, Krave Jerky was founded by Jon Sebastiani after he trained for a marathon and looked for a healthy source of energy.  Alliance Consumer Growth, a private equity group, invested in Krave Jerky in 2012. Hershey's purchased the company in 2015 for $240 million.  Hershey would later in 2020 sell Krave Jerky to Sonoma Brands, the food industry incubator founded by Sebastiani in 2016.In July 2005, Hershey acquired the Berkeley, California-based boutique chocolate-maker Scharffen Berger. In November 2005, Hershey acquired Joseph Schmidt Confections, the San Francisco-based chocolatier, and in November 2006, Hershey acquired Dagoba Organic Chocolate, a boutique chocolate maker based in Ashland, Oregon.\nIn June 2006, Philadelphia city councilman Juan Ramos called for Hershey's to stop marketing \"Ice Breakers Pacs\", a kind of mint, due to the resemblance of its packaging to a kind that was used for illegal street drugs.In September 2006, ABC News reported that several Hershey chocolate products were reformulated to replace cocoa butter with vegetable oil as an emulsifier. According to the company, this change was made to reduce the costs of producing the products instead of raising their prices or decreasing the sizes. Some consumers complained that the taste was different, but the company stated that in the company-sponsored blind taste tests, about half of consumers preferred the new versions. As the new versions no longer met the Food and Drug Administration's official definition of \"milk chocolate\", the changed items were relabeled from stating they were \"milk chocolate\" and \"made with chocolate\" to \"chocolate candy\" and \"chocolatey.\"In December 2011, Hershey reached an agreement to acquire Brookside Foods Ltd., a privately held confectionery company based in Abbotsford, British Columbia.In April 2015, the Hershey chocolate plant on East Chocolate Avenue in Hershey Pennsylvania was demolished to make way for mixed-use development.In 2016, Hershey acquired barkTHINS, a New York-based chocolate snack foods company that expected to generate between $65 million and $75 million in revenue for that year, for $290 million.An August 2016 attempt to sell Hershey to Mondelez International was abandoned because of objections by the Hershey Trust.In 2017, Hershey acquired Amplify Snack Brands, Austin, Texas-based maker of SkinnyPop, in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.6 billion.In September 2018, Hershey announced to buy Pirate Brands from B&G Foods for $420 million in an all-cash deal.In August 2019, Hershey announced it would purchase protein bar maker One Brands LLC for $397 million.In October 2019, Hershey announced a collaboration with Yuengling to produce a limited release collaboration beer titled Yuengling Hershey's Chocolate Porter, becoming Hershey's first licensed beer partnership.In June 2021, Hershey acquired Lily's for $425 million.\n\n\n== Milton Hershey School (MHS) ==\n\nUnable to have children of his own, Milton S. Hershey founded the Hershey Industrial School in 1909 for white orphaned boys. In 1918, three years after the death of his wife, Milton Hershey donated around $90 million to the boarding school in trust, as well as 40% of the Hershey Company's common stock. The school's initial purpose was to train young men in trades but eventually shifted to focus on preparation for college. The Hershey Trust Company has exercised voting rights for the school and has been a trustee since its founding.Many of its designs resemble Hershey chocolate products, such as the Hershey Kisses street lights. Milton Hershey was involved in the school's operations until his death in 1945. The Hershey Industrial School was renamed the Milton Hershey School in 1951.\n\n\n== Manufacturing plants ==\nThe first plant outside Hershey opened on June 15, 1963, in Smiths Falls, Ontario, and the third opened on May 22, 1965, in Oakdale, California. In February and April 2007, Hershey's announced that the Smiths Falls and Oakdale plants would close in 2008, being replaced in part by a new facility in Monterrey, Mexico. The Oakdale factory closed on February 1, 2008. Hershey chocolate factory in S\u00e3o Roque, Brazil, was opened in August 2002. Hershey's Asia operations are largely supplied by their plant in Mandideep, India.Hershey also has plants in Stuarts Draft, Virginia; Lancaster, Pennsylvania; Hazleton, Pennsylvania; Memphis, Tennessee; Robinson, Illinois, and Guadalajara, Mexico.\nVisitors to Hershey can experience Hershey's Chocolate World visitors center and its simulated tour ride. Public tours were once operated in the Pennsylvania and California factories, which ended in Pennsylvania in 1973 as soon as Hershey's Chocolate World opened, and later in California following the September 11, 2001, attacks, due to security concerns.On September 18, 2012, Hershey opened a new and expanded West Hershey plant. The plant was completed at a budget of $300 million.On March 9, 2018, Hershey broke ground to expand its Kit Kat manufacturing facility in Hazle Township, Pennsylvania. The expansion project has a $60 million budget and is expected to create an additional 111 jobs at the facility.\n\n\n== Product recalls ==\nIn July 1998, a number of 100 g (3.5 oz) milk chocolate bars being sold for fundraising events were recalled because they may have contained traces of almonds not listed in the ingredients.\nIn November 2006, the Smiths Falls production plant in Ontario temporarily shut down and several products were voluntarily recalled after concerns over Salmonella contamination possibly found in soy lecithin within their production line. It was believed that most of the products involved in the recall never made it to the retail level.\n\n\n== Philanthropy ==\nHershey has made large contributions to education. One of their most notable contributions was the Elizabethtown College Honors Program. The program was established in 1999 and is funded partially through the endowment.\nIn 2015, Hershey announced a commitment to the Clinton Global Initiative to help build a sustainable supply chain to support basic nutrition for children in Ghana.Hershey's long-term focus on children and families has yielded long-standing partnerships with organizations such as Children's Miracle Network, Ronald McDonald House, and United Way (UW). In 2016, the company donated more than $486,200 to those organizations.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nHershey has been criticized for not having programs to ensure sustainable and ethical cocoa purchases, lagging behind its competitors in fair trade measures.The \"Raise the Bar, Hershey!\" campaign was launched in September 2010 by Global Exchange, Green America, the Oasis Trust, and the International Labor Rights Forum. The purpose of the Raise the Bar Campaign was to pressure Hershey to commit \"to take immediate action to eliminate forced and child labor [...] from Hershey's cocoa supply\"; \"to sourcing 100% Fair Trade Certified cocoa beans by 2012 for at least one of its top five selling chocolate bars [...] making at least one additional top five selling bar 100% Fair Trade Certified every two years thereafter\"; and that \"the majority of Hershey's cocoa across all products will be Fair Trade Certified by 2022\". The pressure was particularly directed at Whole Foods Market, which announced on October 3, 2012, that it would cease carrying Hershey's Scharffen Berger line. The Campaign stated, \"Whole Foods' decision follows more than 40 natural food retailers and coops publicly expressing concern about carrying Scharffen Berger and Dagoba products as a consequence of the giant chocolate maker's refusal to address child labor in its supply chain\". The same day, Hershey's announced it would \"source 100 percent certified cocoa for its global chocolate product lines by 2020 and accelerate its programs to help eliminate child labor in the cocoa regions of West Africa\".In 2019, Hershey announced that they could not guarantee that their chocolate products were free from child slave labor, as they could trace only about 50% of their purchasing back to the farm level. The Washington Post noted that the commitment taken in 2001 to eradicate such practices within 4 years had not been kept, neither at the due deadline of 2005, nor within the revised deadlines of 2008 and  2010, and that the result was not likely to be achieved for 2020 either.In 2021, Hershey was named in a class action lawsuit filed by eight former child slaves from Mali who alleged that the company aided and abetted their enslavement on cocoa plantations in Ivory Coast. The suit accused Hershey (along with Nestl\u00e9, Cargill, Mars, Incorporated, Olam International, Barry Callebaut, and Mondelez International) of knowingly engaging in forced labor, and the plaintiffs sought damages for unjust enrichment, negligent supervision, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\n\n== Products ==\n\n\n=== Gallery ===\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== Additional sources ==\nBrenner, Jo\u00ebl Glenn (2000).

Olam is among the world's largest suppliers of cocoa beans and products, coffee, cotton and rice.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1989, the Kewalram Chanrai Group established Olam Nigeria Plc to set up a non-oil based export operation out of Nigeria to secure hard currency earnings to meet the foreign exchange requirements of the other Group Companies operating in Nigeria. The success of this operation resulted in Olam establishing an independent export operation and sourcing and exporting other agricultural products. The Group's agri-business was headquartered in London until 1996, and operated under the name of Chanrai International Limited. The business began with the export of cashews from Nigeria and then expanded into exports of cotton, cocoa and sheanuts from Nigeria.\n\n\n=== Move to Singapore ===\nBetween 1993 and 1995, the business grew from a single operation into multiple origins, first within West Africa, and then to East Africa and India. The move into multiple origin countries coincided with the deregulation of the agricultural commodity markets.Olam International Limited was incorporated in Singapore on 4 July 1995 as a public limited company. In 1996, at the invitation of the Singapore Trade Development Board (now Enterprise Singapore), Olam relocated their entire operations from London to Singapore.  Furthermore, the Singapore Government awarded Olam the Approved International Trader status (now called the Global Trader Programme) under which Olam was granted a concessionary tax rate of 10%, which was subsequently reduced, in 2004, to 5%. On relocation to Singapore, the Group's agri-business was reorganised to be wholly owned by Olam International Limited in Singapore.\n\n\n=== IPO ===\nIn 2002, AIF Capital became the first external investor to take an equity stake in the company. In 2003, the state-owned Temasek Holdings, through its wholly owned subsidiary Seletar Investments, took a stake in Olam, followed by International Finance Corporation (IFC).In 2005, Olam International Limited was listed on the main board of the Singapore Exchange on 11 February 2005. Temasek made a further investment in Olam in 2009.As of December 2014, following a Voluntary General Offer Temasek held close to 80% of Olam. By 2020 this had reduced to 53.4%. In 2015 Mitsubishi Corporation acquired a shareholding of 20% making them the second largest shareholder.The management team of Olam has a shareholding in the company approximating 6.3% of the total issued share capital. Olam's free float owned by public shareholders accounts for approximately 15.9% of the total issued share capital in 2020.\n\n\n=== Possible merger and divestment ===\nIn 2010, Olam International discussed a possible merger with one of its main competitors; Geneva-based Louis Dreyfus Commodities, the world's largest cotton and rice trading company. This idea was abandoned in early 2011.Olam announced in July 2013, that it would sell its cotton assets in Zimbabwe, with the preferred buyer being a private equity company.In 2019, the company announced plans to sell its sugar, rubber, wood products and fertiliser units.\n\n\n=== Restructuring ===\nIn January 2020, Olam International announced division of its portfolio of diverse products into two new operating businesses, Olam Food Ingredients (OFI) and Olam Global Agri (OGA). The decision followed from its 2019 business review, and a multi-year plan announced early in 2019 to invest US$3.5 billion into key growth areas, such as edible nuts, coffee and cocoa, while shedding other sectors. In the statement released by the firm, Olam Food Ingredients (OFI), will consist of its cocoa, coffee, edible nuts, spices and dairy businesses, Olam Global Agri (OGA) will include grains and animal feed, edible oils, rice, cotton and commodity financial services.\n\n\n== Community Involvement ==\n\n\n=== Eradicating Child Labour ===\nIn 2020, Olam Cocoa, a subsidiary of Olam International, rolled out a new initiative in partnership with the Fair Labor Association (FLA) and local cocoa farming cooperatives to digitally register its nearly 7,000 farmer suppliers in Cameroon and their households. This also include introducing rigorous tractability and reporting systems, educating local communities about child labor, as well as setting up dedicated child labor monitoring and remediation systems (CLMRS).  In 2018/2019, Olam found more than 7,000 instances of inappropriate child labor in its supply chain, remediating approximately 70% of them.  This is the first instance of professional application of such initiatives at such a scale in Cameroon. Forward, the company plans to expand its initiative to cover nearly 223,000 farmers in three countries across West Africa.\n\n\n=== Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP) ===\nOlam International currently one of the founding members of the Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP), a multi-stakeholder platform, co-convened by United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) and the International Rice Research Institute to promote resource efficiency and sustainable trade flows, production and consumption operations, and supply chains in the global rice sector.\n\n\n=== Sustainable cocoa initiatives ===\nin order to improve crop yields in its network, Olam Cocoa has implemented a digital information system called Olam Farmer Information System (OFIS) to collect data from more than 160,000 cocoa farmers across 20 countries, tracking a range of farm level data points including cocoa tree age and soil type.  For the 2020 growing season, Olam Cocoa has joined a program with the Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) to distribute locally-sourced fertilizer to cocoa farmers in its cocoa sourcing operations in that country.\n\n\n== Allegations ==\n\n\n=== Deforestation-linked palm oil, cocoa, and rubber ===\nBetween 2011 and 2015, Olam's palm oil trade volume grew by approximately twenty times\u2014from 71,000 tons to 1.53 million tons. Despite Olam's stated commitment to RSPO-certified palm oil, the company shunned transparency as it expanded its palm oil production.A report released by the NGO Mighty Earth and Gabon-based NGO Brainforest on December 12, 2016 revealed that Olam was operating a secretive palm oil trading operation worldwide, particularly with its third party suppliers in Asia. Olam was accused of endangering the forest habitats of gorillas, chimpanzees and forest elephants due to widespread deforestation. It was revealed that in Gabon, Olam had cut 26,000 hectares (64,000 acres) of forest for palm oil.The photos and videos featured in the NGO report show Olam bulldozing Gabonese rainforests for rubber and to establish what they intended to build as Africa's largest palm oil plantation. The analysis found that in Gabon, Olam cleared approximately 26,000 hectares of forest across its four palm oil concessions since 2012 and additional forests for rubber.\nThe two NGOs also documented Olam's cutting down an area the size of Washington DC in what had been an intact forest landscape in Northern Gabon, for rubber in Gabon.On December 16, 2016, shortly after the report was released, Mighty Earth submitted a formal complaint against Olam to the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) for Olam's deforestation and for violating FSC policies. \nIn response to these allegations, on February 21, 2017, Olam suspended further land clearing of forests in Gabon for at least a year. As a result, Mighty Earth suspended its campaign.The agreement between Mighty Earth and Olam was renewed in 2018. In its inaugural Excellence Awards in 2019, the industry-led Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil recognized Olam International for its conservation leadership in developing sustainable palm oil plantations having a positive impact on forest conservation, species conservation and emission reduction in Gabon.On September 13, 2017 NGO Mighty Earth released a second report documenting findings that Olam purchases cocoa grown illegally in national parks and other protected forests in the Ivory Coast. The report accused Olam of endangering the forest habitats of chimpanzees, elephants and other wildlife populations by purchasing cocoa linked to deforestation. As a result of cocoa production, 7 of the 23 Ivorian protected areas have been almost entirely converted to cocoa. Olam was notified of the findings of Mighty Earth's investigation and did not deny that the company sourced its cocoa from protected areas in the Ivory Coast.\nIn 2020 the FSC, Olam and Mighty Earth commissioned SmartCert Group to perform a retrospective assessment of previous deforestation for Olam's palm oil plantations in Gabon. A second investigation will focus on Olam's rubber plantations in Gabon.\n\n\n=== Muddy Waters allegations ===\nIn November 2012, Carson Block of Muddy Waters Research accused Olam of \"deciding to take huge leverage and invest in illiquid positions\", questioning its accounting practices and accusing its board of an \"abject failure of leadership\".  Olam called the allegations \"baseless rumour-mongering\" and sued Block for libel, but its shares nevertheless fell 21%.\n\n\n=== Forced evictions and land clearance in Laos ===\nThe company is involved in the production of coffee in Laos and the clearance of forests and villages to plant large plantations. Areas of land that were acquired by the company were previously inhabited and farmed by villagers who had paid their land taxes and were also farming coffee alongside other products. Compensation was only partly paid, with many evicted landholders being paid only in rice. Many landholders are now facing challenges to grow enough food to survive. This development of large industrial plantations at the sacrifice of the small holding family unit is argued by some to be counterproductive to the development of Laos; as it reduces the overall agricultural productivity; and increases poverty amongst the families, while a few officials and the company benefit.\n\n\n=== Child Slavery ===\nIn 2021, Olam International was named in a class action lawsuit filed by eight former child slaves from Mali who allege that the company aided and abetted their enslavement on cocoa plantations in Ivory Coast. The suit accused Olam (along with Nestl\u00e9, Cargill, Mars, Incorporated, Barry Callebaut, The Hershey Company, and Mondelez International) of knowingly engaging in forced labor, and the plaintiffs sought damages for unjust enrichment, negligent supervision, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCommodity markets\nNoble\nWilmar\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOlam Corporate Website\nOlam's activities in Tanzania\nOlam's problems in Guinea-Bissau", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Flag_of_Singapore.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Increase2.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Unbalanced_scales.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Olam_LOGO_RGB_COLOUR_reduced_resolution_transparent.PNG"], "summary": "Olam International is a major food and agri-business company, operating in 60 countries and supplying food and industrial raw materials to over 19,800 customers worldwide.
